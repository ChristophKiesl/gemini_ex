Item 1. Business
Overview
Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis, we, our or us) is an oncology-focused biotechnology company that strives to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. Our drug discovery and development capabilities and commercialization platform are the foundations upon which we intend to bring to market novel, effective and tolerable therapies to provide cancer patients with additional treatment options.
Since we were founded in 1994, four products resulting from our discovery efforts have progressed through clinical development, received regulatory approval and established a commercial presence in various geographies around the world. Two are derived from cabozantinib, our flagship molecule, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors and RET. Our cabozantinib products are: CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) tablets approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), both alone and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMS) OPDIVO® (nivolumab), and for previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib) capsules approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). For these types of cancer, cabozantinib has become or is becoming a standard of care. Beyond these approved indications, cabozantinib is currently the focus of a broad clinical development program, and is being investigated both alone and in combination with other therapies in a wide variety of cancers. The growth that we have experienced in recent years is largely attributable to cabozantinib’s clinical and commercial success; consistent with our values and legal obligations, we are committed to ensuring that all patients who are prescribed cabozantinib are able to access this critical medicine.
The other two products resulting from our discovery efforts are: COTELLIC® (cobimetinib), an inhibitor of MEK approved as part of multiple combination regimens to treat specific forms of advanced melanoma and marketed under a collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group) (Genentech); and MINNEBRO® (esaxerenone), an oral, non-steroidal, selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) approved for the treatment of hypertension in Japan and licensed to Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo). For additional information about these products, see “—Collaborations—Other Collaborations.”
Over the course of 2020, revenues from CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ sales and from the royalties and milestone payments we have received pursuant to collaboration agreements with our partners, coupled with disciplined expense management, fueled the growth of our organization. We believe in our long-term growth prospects, which are supported by a healthy cash position and annual profitability over the past four fiscal years. We have and plan to continue to utilize our cash and investments to maximize the likelihood of future success by expanding the development program for the cabozantinib franchise, and by advancing and expanding our pipeline of new drug candidates through drug discovery efforts, which include several research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements and has resulted in two compounds entering the clinic. The following report details the progress we have made executing our growth strategy.

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we earned $78.4 million, $62.4 million and $32.3 million, respectively, of royalties on net sales of cabozantinib products outside of the U.S. For additional information on the terms of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations.”
Renal Cell Carcinoma - CABOMETYX is a Leading Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Treatment Option for Patients with Advanced RCC
Kidney cancer is among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S. Estimates suggest that approximately 32,000 patients in the U.S. and over 71,000 worldwide will require systemic treatment for kidney cancer in 2021, with nearly 15,000 patients in need of a first-line treatment in the U.S. A growing number of these patients with RCC have been or will be treated with CABOMETYX, which has become a standard of care for the treatment of patients suffering from this difficult-to-treat disease.
Since CABOMETYX was first approved, we have deployed our promotional and medical affairs teams to educate physicians about CABOMETYX’s unique clinical profile. We believe that the success of CABOMETYX is attributable to this clinical profile, which incorporates the results of the METEOR, CABOSUN and CheckMate -9ER clinical trials. In July 2015, we announced positive results of METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing CABOMETYX to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor inhibitor. These results formed the basis for the FDA’s approval in April 2016, following which CABOMETYX became the first and only single-agent therapy approved for previously treated advanced RCC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in three key efficacy parameters in a global pivotal trial: overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS); and objective response rate (ORR). Subsequently, in October 2016, we announced positive results from CABOSUN, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, comparing cabozantinib with sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. These results formed the basis for the FDA’s approval in December 2017 of CABOMETYX for previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, and for this patient population, CABOMETYX is the only approved single-agent therapy to improve PFS compared with sunitinib, a first-generation TKI that was the previous standard of care.
CABOMETYX has also demonstrated strong clinical results in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), most notably the positive results from CheckMate -9ER, an open-label, randomized, multi-national phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating OPDIVO, an ICI developed by BMS, in combination with CABOMETYX versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. Results from CheckMate -9ER formed the basis for the FDA’s approval of the combination in January 2021 as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. For additional information about CABOMETYX’s efficacy in combination with ICIs, including as demonstrated in the CheckMate -9ER clinical trial data, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements.”
In markets outside the U.S. in 2020, we continued to work closely with our collaboration partner Ipsen in support of its regulatory strategy and commercialization efforts for CABOMETYX as a treatment for advanced RCC, both as a single agent and in preparation for potential approvals of CABOMETYX in combination with other therapies, and similarly with our collaboration partner Takeda with respect to the Japanese market. As a result of the approvals of CABOMETYX for RCC indications in 57 countries outside of the U.S., including the Member States of the EU, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, CABOMETYX has continued to grow outside the U.S. both in sales revenue and the number of RCC patients benefiting from its clinical effect. 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma - the CABOMETYX Label Expanded to Include Previously Treated HCC
According to published studies, liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more than 800,000 deaths and 900,000 new cases each year. In the U.S., the incidence of liver cancer has more than tripled since 1980. Although HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, making up about three-fourths of the more than 42,000 cases of liver cancer estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. during 2021, this patient population has long been underserved. Prior to 2017, there was only one approved systemic therapy for the treatment of HCC. Since that time, multiple new therapies were approved in the U.S. for HCC, both for previously untreated patients and for patients previously treated with sorafenib. Given the introduction of new and demonstrably more effective therapies, including ICI combination therapies, we believe the second- and later-line market for HCC therapies has the potential to grow significantly in coming years, as these new treatment options are expected to improve longer-term outcomes, thereby resulting in a greater number of patients receiving multiple lines of therapy. With the approval of CABOMETYX in January 2019 for HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib, we expect to continue to play a key role in the treatment landscape for these patients.
The FDA’s approval of CABOMETYX’s HCC indication was based on our phase 3 pivotal study, CELESTIAL. The CELESTIAL study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that cabozantinib significantly improved OS, as compared to placebo. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has included CABOMETYX in its Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
Hepatobiliary Cancers as a Category 1 option for the treatment of patients with HCC (Child-Pugh Class A only) who have been previously treated with sorafenib, providing further support for CABOMETYX as an important treatment option for eligible HCC patients.
Outside the U.S., the EC’s approval of CABOMETYX provided physicians in the EU with a second approved therapy for the second-line treatment of this aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancer, and approvals from Health Canada and the Japanese MHLW brought a much-needed therapy to HCC patients in those countries. In addition to the Member States of the EU, Japan and Canada, CABOMETYX is also approved for previously treated HCC indications in Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong, among other countries.
Medullary Thyroid Cancer - COMETRIQ, the First Commercial Approval of Cabozantinib
Estimates suggest that there will be approximately 900 MTC cases diagnosed in the U.S. in 2021, and COMETRIQ has served as an important treatment option for these patients since November 2012. The FDA’s approval of COMETRIQ for progressive, metastatic MTC was based on our phase 3 trial, EXAM. The EXAM trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation in PFS for cabozantinib, as compared to placebo. In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, including a requirement to conduct the EXAMINER clinical study, comparing a lower dose of cabozantinib with the labeled dose of 140 mg. For additional information on the EXAMINER post-marketing study, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Late-Stage Exelixis Sponsored Trials Evaluating Cabozantinib as a Monotherapy—MTC - EXAMINER.” 
Exelixis Development Programs
As part of our mission to help cancer patients recover stronger and live longer, we deploy our resources and invest in clinical development programs designed to identify and advance potential new cancer therapies that prove to be both safe and effective. Most of our resources remain dedicated to exploring the use of cabozantinib in new indications as a single-agent or in combination with other therapies, and in the near-term our growth strategy will continue to focus on the achievement of positive clinical trial results and new regulatory approvals for cabozantinib. However, we are steadily advancing additional small molecules and biologics through our pipeline of potential development candidates. In 2020, in addition to the standard complexities typically associated with the execution of global clinical trials, we were also presented with new challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which required us to make operational adjustments to our clinical study programs both to preserve their scientific integrity and to protect the safety of patients. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
A summary of our cabozantinib and other development programs is provided below.
Cabozantinib Development Program
Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Objective tumor responses have been observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in more than 20 individual tumor types investigated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to date, reflecting the medicine’s broad clinical potential. We are currently evaluating cabozantinib, both as a single agent and in combination with ICIs, in a broad development program comprising over 100 ongoing or planned clinical trials across multiple indications. We, along with our collaboration partners, sponsor some of those trials, and independent investigators conduct the remaining trials through our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (NCI-CTEP) or our investigator sponsored trial (IST) program. In addition to co-funding select trials with us, our collaboration partners Ipsen and Takeda also conduct trials in their territories through similar independently-sponsored programs.
The following two tables summarize select cabozantinib clinical development activities, one describing studies that evaluate the potential of cabozantinib as a single-agent, and the other describing studies that evaluate the potential of cabozantinib in combination with other therapies, including ICIs:

Late-Stage Exelixis Sponsored Trials Evaluating Cabozantinib as a Monotherapy
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) - COSMIC-311. Published studies indicate that approximately 44,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2021. Differentiated thyroid tumors, which make up about 90% of all thyroid cancers, are typically treated with surgery followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid with radioiodine (RAI). Approximately 5% to 15% of differentiated thyroid tumors are resistant to RAI treatment. With limited treatment options, these patients have a life expectancy of only three to six years from the time metastatic lesions are detected. New treatment options are therefore urgently needed. In December 2020 we announced that COSMIC-311, our ongoing phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with RAI-refractory DTC who have progressed after up to two prior VEGF receptor-targeted therapies, met its co-primary endpoint of demonstrating significant improvement in PFS. Cabozantinib reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 78% with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.22 (96% confidence interval [CI] 0.13 – 0.36; p<0.0001). The safety profile of cabozantinib observed in the study was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib, and no new safety signals emerged. Given these results, the independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended to stop enrollment and unblind sites and patients. We intend to discuss the study results, proposed changes to the study conduct, as well as plans for filing a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA in 2021.
MTC - EXAMINER. In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, including a requirement to conduct the EXAMINER clinical study, comparing a lower 60 mg dose of cabozantinib (tablet formulation) with the labeled dose of 140 mg (capsule formulation). EXAMINER evaluated PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1 as assessed by independent 
review as a primary endpoint, as well as ORR and safety as secondary endpoints, in progressive, metastatic MTC patients. EXAMINER was designed as a non-inferiority trial for PFS comparing 60 mg cabozantinib (tablet formulation) with 140 mg cabozantinib (capsule formulation). EXAMINER did not reach its primary endpoint. We intend to submit the results of EXAMINER to regulatory authorities as part of our post-marketing requirements, and we will continue to market COMETRIQ capsules for MTC patients consistent with the existing approval. Detailed results of the study will be presented at an upcoming medical conference.
Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements
Cabozantinib has shown clinical anti-tumor activity with objective responses observed in more than 20 forms of cancer in phase 1 and 2 evaluation; we are, therefore, focused on advancing a broad cabozantinib clinical development program to fully investigate its therapeutic potential, both alone and in combination with other therapies. In particular, given that clinical observations from clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib in combination with ICIs have shown preliminary promising activity across a diverse range of tumors, and that patients have been able to tolerate these drug combinations, we are focused on exploring the potential of cabozantinib in combination with ICIs in late-stage or other potentially label-enabling trials. 
Combination Studies with BMS
As part of our development strategy for the cabozantinib franchise, in February 2017, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of conducting clinical studies combining cabozantinib with BMS’ PD-1 ICI, nivolumab, both with or without BMS’ CTLA-4 ICI, ipilimumab. As part of this collaboration, we are evaluating these combinations in two phase 3 pivotal trials in previously untreated advanced RCC and in a phase 1/2 trial in both previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC. We may also evaluate these combinations in other clinical trials in various other tumor types. Pursuant to our agreements with BMS, each party will be responsible for supplying finished drug product for the applicable clinical trial, and responsibility for the payment of costs for each trial will be determined on a trial-by-trial basis. For additional information on the terms of the clinical trial collaboration agreement, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—BMS.”
RCC - CheckMate -9ER. In April 2020, we announced positive results from CheckMate -9ER, an open-label, randomized, multi-national phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 240 mg of nivolumab every 2 weeks, or 50 mg of sunitinib daily on a 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off schedule. The trial met its primary endpoint of PFS at final analysis, as well as its secondary endpoints of OS at a pre-specified interim analysis and ORR. The combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab: significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared with sunitinib (HR=0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.64; p<0.0001); significantly improved OS, reducing the risk of death by 40% compared with sunitinib (HR=0.60; 98.89% CI 0.40 to 0.89; p<0.0010); and demonstrated a superior ORR of 56% versus 27% for sunitinib. The safety profile of the combination observed in the study was consistent with the established profile of each agent. Data from CheckMate -9ER were presented at Presidential Symposium I at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2020 in September 2020 and will be presented at the virtual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2021. On the basis of the data from the CheckMate -9ER trial, the FDA approved the combination of CABOMETYX and OPDIVO on January 22, 2021 as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, and we and BMS commenced the commercial launch of the combination upon such approval. Additionally, in September 2020, the EMA validated the type II variation applications submitted by Ipsen and BMS to approve the combination of CABOMETYX and OPDIVO as a treatment for advanced RCC and commenced the EMA’s centralized review process. Both Ipsen and BMS have also submitted applications to approve the combination in territories beyond the EU, including Australia, Canada and Brazil, and plan to submit additional applications in other territories. In October 2020, Takeda and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ono), BMS’ development and commercialization partner in Japan, submitted a supplemental application to the Japanese MHLW for Manufacturing and Marketing Approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO for the treatment of patients with unresectable, advanced or metastatic RCC.
RCC - COSMIC-313. In May 2019, we initiated COSMIC-313, a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab versus the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with previously untreated advanced intermediate- or poor-risk RCC. The study aims to enroll approximately 840 patients at up to 180 sites globally. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab or to the control arm of nivolumab and ipilimumab in combination with matched placebo. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints 
include OS and ORR. Based on recent publication of long-term follow-up results for CheckMate 214, in which the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed a longer median OS compared to original assumptions, we expanded the enrollment target for COSMIC-313 to 840 patients to provide additional power to assess the secondary endpoint of OS for COSMIC-313, and we expect to complete the expanded enrollment in early 2021 and report top-line results of the event-driven analyses from the trial in 2022. We are sponsoring COSMIC-313, and BMS is providing nivolumab and ipilimumab for the study free of charge.
HCC- CheckMate 040. CheckMate 040 is a large, multi-cohort phase 1/2 trial in patients with previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC, including a cohort evaluating treatment regimens that include cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab or in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab. This cohort was designed to enroll approximately 30 patients into each of two groups, with one group receiving 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 3 mg/kg of nivolumab every two weeks, and the other group receiving 40 mg of cabozantinib daily, 3 mg/kg of nivolumab every two weeks and 1 mg/kg ipilimumab every six weeks. The primary endpoints for the cohorts are safety and tolerability and ORR; secondary endpoints include duration of response (DOR), PFS and OS. Results for CheckMate 040 were presented at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January 2020. For the 36 patients treated with the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab, ORR was 19%, and DCR was 75%. Median PFS was 5.4 months, and median OS was 21.5 months. For the 35 patients treated with the combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab, ORR was 29%, and DCR was 83%. Median PFS was 6.8 months, and median OS had not yet been reached as of the data cut-off date. The safety profile of the combinations observed in the study were consistent with the established profile of each agent, and no new safety signals emerged.
Combination Studies with Roche
Diversifying our exploration of cabozantinib combinations with ICIs, in February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche) for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s anti-PD-L1 ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. As part of the clinical supply agreement, we are evaluating this combination in a phase 1b trial in locally advanced or metastatic tumors and a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated advanced HCC. Informed by the data generated from the phase 1b trial, COSMIC-021, we also entered into a joint clinical research agreement with Roche in December 2019, pursuant to which we are evaluating this combination in three late-stage clinical trials: the first, CONTACT-01, focuses on patients with metastatic NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy; the second, CONTACT-02, focuses on patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy; and the third, CONTACT-03, focuses on patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC who have progressed during or following treatment with an ICI as the immediate preceding therapy. For additional information on the terms of the joint clinical research agreement, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—Roche.”
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors - COSMIC-021. In June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021, a phase 1b dose escalation study that is evaluating the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with Roche’s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We are the trial sponsor of COSMIC-021, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. The study is divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase, which was completed in 2018; and an expansion cohort phase, which is ongoing. The dose-escalation phase of the study determined the optimal dose of cabozantinib as 40 mg daily when given in combination with the standard atezolizumab dosing regimen of 1200 mg infusion once every 3 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities or serious adverse events (AEs) were noted. Dose reductions and higher-grade AEs were less frequent with the 40 mg cabozantinib dosing cohort. Encouraging clinical activity was also observed. The safety profile of the combination in the dose-escalation phase of the trial was consistent with the established profile of each combination agent, and no new safety signals emerged.
 Enrollment in the expansion stage of this study, which is currently ongoing, includes the following 20 combination tumor expansion cohorts:
•patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with an ICI;
•patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with an ICI;
•patients with NSCLC with an EGFR mutation who have progressed following treatment with an EGFR-targeting TKI for metastatic disease;
•patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an ICI;
•patients with mCRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate without prior docetaxel for mCRPC and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue;
•patients with mCRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate with prior docetaxel therapy for mCRPC;
•patients with mCRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate without prior docetaxel therapy for mCRPC;
•patients with RCC with clear cell histology who have not received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy;
•patients with RCC with non-clear cell histology who have received no more than one prior VEGF receptor-targeted therapy and no other systemic anti-cancer therapy;
•patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy;
•patients with UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy;
•patients with UC who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy;
•patients with triple-negative breast cancer who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy;
•patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who have platinum-resistant or refractory disease;
•patients with endometrial cancer who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy;
•patients with advanced HCC who have a Child-Pugh score of A and have not received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy;
•patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have progressed following treatment with platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy;
•patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who have progressed following treatment with systemic chemotherapy that contained fluoropyrimidine in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan for metastatic disease;
•patients with head and neck cancer of squamous cell histology who have progressed following treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy; and
•patients with DTC who are radio-refractory or deemed ineligible for treatment with iodine-131.
Each expansion cohort was designed to initially enroll approximately 30 patients. However, based on continuing encouraging efficacy and safety data, certain cohorts have been and may be further expanded, including the cohorts of patients with NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and mCRPC who have been previously treated with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue. In addition, in order to address the contribution of components, there are three exploratory cohorts that will evaluate cabozantinib as a single-agent therapy in (1) patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with an ICI, (2) patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an ICI and (3) patients with mCRPC, as well as a fourth exploratory cohort that will evaluate atezolizumab as a single-agent therapy in patients with mCRPC. We anticipate completing enrollment of up to 1,732 patients in the trial in the first half of 2021, although both the timing and final number of patients are subject to the initiation of additional cohorts or expansion of selected existing cohorts, as well as any further delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since the initiation of the trial, data from COSMIC-021 have been instrumental in guiding our clinical development strategy for cabozantinib in combination with ICIs, including supporting the initiation of COSMIC-312, CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02 and CONTACT-03. Encouraging results from interim analyses from the mCRPC, NSCLC, clear cell RCC and non-clear cell RCC cohorts of COSMIC-021, which were presented at various medical conferences throughout 2020, are described below: 
•mCRPC: An interim analysis of 44 mCRPC patients treated with the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab demonstrated an ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 32% and a DCR of 80%. Among the 36 of those mCRPC patients with high-risk clinical features, the ORR was 33%. Based on regulatory feedback from the FDA, and if supported by the clinical data, we intend to file with the FDA for accelerated approval in an mCRPC indication in 2021.
•NSCLC: Initial results from 30 NSCLC patients demonstrated an ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 27% and a DCR of 83%. Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI 2.7-7.0), and median DOR was 5.7 months.
•Clear cell RCC: Initial results from 34 RCC patients with clear cell histology who received 40 mg of cabozantinib daily in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated an ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 53% and a DCR of 94%. Median PFS was 19.5 months (95% CI 11.0—NE), and median DOR had not been reached as of the date of the analysis. Initial results from an additional 36 RCC patients with clear cell histology who received 60 mg of cabozantinib daily in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated an ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 58% and a DCR of 92%. Median PFS was 15.1 months (95% CI 8.2—22.3), and median DOR was 15.4 months.
•Non-clear cell RCC: Initial results from 30 RCC patients with non-clear cell histology who received 40 mg of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated an ORR per RECIST v. 1.1 of 33% and a DCR of 93%. Median PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI 5.5—NE), and median DOR was 8.3 months.
The safety profile of the combination was consistent with the established profile of each agent, and no new safety signals emerged.
HCC - COSMIC-312. In December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312, a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in previously untreated advanced HCC. The trial also includes a third arm evaluating cabozantinib monotherapy in this first-line setting in order to address the contribution of components. In August 2020, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in COSMIC-312, providing the requisite patient population to conduct the event-driven analyses of the trial’s co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS. Separately, patient enrollment remains open in China in order to enroll a sufficient number of patients to enable local registration, if supported by the clinical data. Patients are being randomized to one of three arms: cabozantinib (40 mg) and atezolizumab; sorafenib; or cabozantinib (60 mg). Based on current event rates, we anticipate announcing top-line results in the first half of 2021. We are sponsoring COSMIC-312, and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. Ipsen will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. and Japan. Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. If the data are supportive, we anticipate filing an sNDA with the FDA in 2021, and Ipsen would also seek to file marketing applications with regulatory agencies in its respective territories based on the results.
NSCLC - CONTACT-01. Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 235,000 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2021. The disease is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women, causing 25% of all cancer-related deaths. The majority (84%) of lung cancer cases are NSCLC, which mainly comprise adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. The five-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is 24%, but that rate falls to just 6% for those with advanced or metastatic disease. More than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and more options are needed for these patients. Due to the ongoing urgent need for treatment options for patients with NSCLC and based on the positive early-stage results from COSMIC-021, in June 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-01, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial aims to enroll approximately 350 patients at up to 121 sites globally. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of docetaxel. The primary endpoint for the trial is OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DOR. CONTACT-01 is sponsored by Roche and co-funded by us. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have opted into and are co-funding the trial, and both companies will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S. 
mCRPC - CONTACT-02. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2021, approximately 250,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed, and 34,000 people will die from the disease. Prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and does not respond to androgen-suppression therapies—a common treatment for prostate cancer—is known as mCRPC. Researchers estimate that in 2020, 43,000 men were diagnosed with mCRPC, which has a median survival of less than two years. In response to this significant unmet need and based on the positive early-stage results from COSMIC-021, in June 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-02, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. The trial aims to enroll approximately 580 patients at up to 250 sites globally. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of a second novel hormonal therapy (either abiraterone and prednisone or enzalutamide). The co-primary endpoints for the trial are OS and PFS, and secondary endpoints include ORR, prostate-specific antigen response rate and DOR. CONTACT-02 is sponsored by us and co-funded by Roche. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have opted into and are co-funding the trial, and both companies will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S.
RCC - CONTACT-03. Taking into account the rapidly evolving treatment landscape for RCC and based on the positive early-stage results from COSMIC-021, in July 2020, we and Roche initiated CONTACT-03, a global, multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic RCC who progressed during or following treatment with an ICI as the immediate preceding therapy. The trial aims to enroll approximately 500 patients at up to 167 sites globally. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab or to the control arm of cabozantinib alone. The co-primary endpoints for the trial are PFS per RECIST v. 1.1 as assessed by independent review and OS, and secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DOR as assessed by the investigators. CONTACT-03 is sponsored by Roche and co-funded by us. In addition, both Ipsen and Takeda have the right to opt in and co-fund the trial and if doing so, they will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions in their respective territories outside of the U.S. We intend to use the data from CONTACT-03 to further study the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in this patient population, both as a single agent and in combination with ICIs. 
Other Trials Evaluating Cabozantinib in Combination with other Therapies
RCC - CANTATA: In January 2021 Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Calithera) announced that the CANTATA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improving PFS per independent review for Calithera’s teleaglenastat (also known as CB-839) plus cabozantinib as compared with cabozantinib alone in previously treated advanced or metastatic RCC. The HR was 0.94 (p=0.65), and median PFS was 9.2 months among patients treated with telaglenastat and cabozantinib as compared to 9.3 months for patients treated with cabozantinib and placebo. Exelixis provided cabozantinib for the trial through a material supply agreement with Calithera.
Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program
In October 2011, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-CTEP for the clinical development of cabozantinib. Through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program we have been able to expand the development program for the cabozantinib franchise while avoiding over-burdening our development resources. Our CRADA reflects a major commitment by NCI-CTEP to support the broad exploration of cabozantinib’s potential in a wide variety of cancers, each representing a substantial unmet medical need. Through this mechanism, NCI-CTEP provides funding for as many as 20 active clinical trials of cabozantinib each year for a five-year period. The term of the CRADA was extended in October 2016 for an additional five-year period through October 2021, provided that both parties maintain the right to terminate the CRADA for any reason upon sixty days’ notice, for an uncured material breach upon thirty days’ notice and immediately for safety concerns. Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for trials under the CRADA are held by NCI-CTEP. NCI-CTEP also retains rights to any inventions made in whole or in part by NCI-CTEP investigators. However, for inventions that claim the use and/or the composition of cabozantinib, we have an automatic option to elect a worldwide, non-exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions for commercial purposes, with the right to sublicense to affiliates or collaborators working on our behalf, as well as an additional, separate option to negotiate an exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions. Further, before any trial proposed under the CRADA may commence, the protocol is subject to our review and approval, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. As reflected by the results from completed trials and given the numerous ongoing and planned clinical trials, we believe our CRADA with NCI-CTEP has and will enable us to continue to expand the cabozantinib development program broadly in a cost-efficient manner. A summary of key ongoing trials under this collaboration is provided below.
Advanced Genitourinary Tumors
PDIGREE is a phase 3 trial led by The Alliance that is enrolling 1,046 intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC patients who have a clear cell component in their tumors. All patients are initially treated with up to 4 cycles of induction ipilimumab combined with nivolumab. Subsequently, patients are treated based on their response to the induction therapy. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) continue on maintenance nivolumab, while patients with progressive disease (PD) are switched to cabozantinib monotherapy. Patients who neither achieve a CR nor develop PD during induction are randomized 1:1 to either maintenance nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib 40 mg daily. The primary endpoint is OS, while PFS, CR rate, ORR and safety are among the secondary endpoints.
In February 2021, positive initial results were announced from PAPMET (also known as SWOG S1500), a randomized phase 2 trial conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group evaluating cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with metastatic papillary RCC. PAPMET met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation of PFS, and more detailed results from PAPMET will be presented at the virtual ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2021.
RADICAL is a randomized phase 2 trial being conducted by The Alliance that plans to enroll up to 210 patients with advanced RCC. All patients must have at least 2 sites of bone metastases and may have received up to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 to be treated with cabozantinib in combination with radium-223 dichloride or cabozantinib as a single agent. The primary endpoint is symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, while secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, ORR and safety.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
The Alliance is leading the CABINET study that treats patients with well- or moderately-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). CABINET includes 2 separate randomized studies, one for patients with pancreatic NETs and the other for patients with carcinoid tumors. The planned enrollment for the pancreatic NET study is 185 patients and for the carcinoid study is 210 patients. Both studies randomize previously treated patients 2:1 to cabozantinib 60 mg daily or placebo. The primary endpoint for both studies is PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 as determined by a blinded IRRC. 
Other Cancer Indications
There are 60 ongoing and 32 planned externally sponsored trials evaluating the clinical and therapeutic potential of cabozantinib, including those administered through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program. Like our CRADA with NCI-CTEP, our IST program helps us to continue to evaluate cabozantinib across a broad range of tumor types.
These externally sponsored trials include signal seeking studies of single-agent cabozantinib, novel combinations, and randomized trials. The monotherapy trials are focused on solid tumors including genitourinary neoplasms, gastrointestinal malignancies, lung cancer and a variety of less common tumor types. The combination studies include trials combining cabozantinib with several different ICIs, as well as studies adding cabozantinib to various other anti-cancer therapies, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), chemotherapeutic agents, small molecules which target specific cellular pathways, or radiation. In addition to the various trials described above, our CRADA includes a randomized phase 2 study in recurrent endometrial cancer, in which the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab demonstrated improved PFS compared with nivolumab, and an ongoing randomized phase 2 study in NSCLC, also in combination with an ICI.
A complete listing of all ongoing cabozantinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
XL092 Development Program
The first compound discovered at Exelixis to enter the clinic following our re-initiation of drug discovery activities was XL092, a next-generation oral TKI that targets VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, MER and other kinases implicated in cancer’s growth and spread. In designing XL092, we sought to build upon our experience with cabozantinib, retaining the target profile of cabozantinib while improving key characteristics, including the pharmacokinetic half-life. We are evaluating XL092 in a growing clinical development program across various tumor types.
Following the FDA’s acceptance of our IND for XL092, we initiated a multicenter phase 1 clinical trial in February 2019 designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XL092. The trial is divided into dose-escalation and expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, with the primary objective of determining a dose for daily oral administration of XL092 suitable for further evaluation.
In October 2020, we presented data at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium that suggest XL092 has a desirable therapeutic profile, pairing the potential for significant anti-tumor activity with a much shorter clinical pharmacokinetic half-life than cabozantinib, while also presenting the potential for synergistic effects in combination with ICIs. In consideration of these data, we amended the phase 1 study protocol in October 2020 to include dose-escalation and expansion cohorts for XL092 in combination with atezolizumab and are actively enrolling patients into the dose-escalation cohorts of the combination part of the trial. We expect that once recommended doses of both single-agent XL092 and XL092 in combination with atezolizumab are established, the trial will begin to enroll expansion cohorts for patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and mCRPC.
Based upon our experience with cabozantinib, the clinical profile of XL092 and initial data of the phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating XL092, we are also pursuing additional combination trials evaluating XL092 with multiple therapeutic agents across various tumor types.
XL102 Development Program
XL102 (formerly AUR102) is the lead compound under our research collaboration with Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited (Aurigene). It is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which is an important regulator of the cellular transcriptional and cell cycle machinery. Based on encouraging preclinical data for XL102, which we and Aurigene presented at the 32nd ENA Symposium in October 2020, we exercised our exclusive option to license XL102 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development of XL102. For additional information on our collaboration with Aurigene, see “—Collaborations—Research Collaborations and In-licensing Arrangements—Aurigene.”
XL102 is the subject of an active IND that we submitted to the FDA in November 2020, and that the FDA accepted in December 2020. We are studying the compound in a multicenter phase 1, open-label clinical trial initiated in January 2021 and designed to evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity, both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, in up to 298 patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is divided into dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors, with the primary objective of determining the maximum tolerated dose or recommended dose levels for daily oral administration of XL102 as a single agent. Additional tumor-specific dose-escalation cohorts will determine the recommended XL102 dose level for use in combination with fulvestrant for patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and with abiraterone and prednisone for patients with mCRPC, and potentially with other anti-cancer regimens. Assuming positive data from the initial phase of the trial, the cohort-expansion phase is designed to further explore the selected dose of XL102 in individual tumor cohorts, including ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and mCRPC, and evaluate the anti-tumor activity of XL102, as assessed per RECIST v. 1.1, as well as its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile.
Expansion of the Exelixis Pipeline
We are actively focused on expanding our oncology product pipeline through our drug discovery efforts, which encompass both small molecule and biologics programs with multiple modalities and mechanisms of action. This approach provides a high degree of flexibility with respect to target selection and allows us to prioritize those targets that we believe have the greatest chance of yielding impactful therapeutics. As part of our strategy, our drug discovery activities include research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements that serve to increase our discovery bandwidth and allow us to access a wide range of technology platforms. We will continue to engage in business development initiatives aimed at acquiring and in-licensing promising oncology platforms and assets and then further characterize and develop them utilizing our established preclinical and clinical development infrastructure. 
Small Molecule Programs
Our small molecule discovery programs are supported by a robust and expanding infrastructure, including a library of 4.6 million compounds. We have extensive experience in the identification and optimization of drug candidates against multiple target classes for oncology, inflammation and metabolic diseases.
Since our inception in 1994, our drug discovery group has advanced 23 compounds to the IND stage, either independently or with collaboration partners, and today we deploy our drug discovery expertise in medicinal chemistry, tumor biology and pharmacology to advance small molecule drug candidates toward and through preclinical development. Notably, these efforts are led by some of the same experienced scientists that led the efforts to discover cabozantinib, cobimetinib and esaxerenone, each of which are now commercially distributed drug products. In pursuit of new drug discoveries, we concentrate our in-house work on the most demanding and time-sensitive aspects of lead optimization and use contract research organizations to support more routine activities, thereby minimizing our footprint while still maintaining an agile, competitive approach. We also augment our small molecule discovery activities through research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements with other companies engaged in small molecule discovery, including:
•Aurigene, which is focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecules as therapies for cancer; and
•StemSynergy Therapeutics, Inc. (StemSynergy), which is focused on the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds aimed to inhibit tumor growth by targeting Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CK1α).
For additional information on these research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements related to our small molecule programs, see “—Collaborations—Research Collaborations and In-licensing Arrangements.”
Amongst our small molecule programs, furthest along is XL092, which was discovered at Exelixis and entered the clinic in 2019. For additional information on XL092, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—XL092 Development Program.” We also submitted an IND to the FDA in November 2020 for XL102, the lead Aurigene program targeting CDK7, and initiated the first in-human phase 1 clinical trial in January 2021. For additional information on XL102, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—XL102 Development Program.” In addition, we continue to make progress on multiple, additional lead optimization programs for inhibitors of a variety of targets that we believe play significant roles in tumor growth, and we anticipate that some of these other programs could reach development candidate status in 2021.
Biologics Programs
We are also focusing our drug discovery activities on discovering and advancing various biologics, such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and other innovative biologics that have the potential to become anti-cancer therapies. We believe that biotherapeutics of these classes have the potential to be significant cancer therapies, as evidenced, for example, by the multiple regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of ADCs in the past year. To facilitate the growth of our biologics programs, we have established multiple research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements that provide us with access to antibodies and other binders, which are the starting point for use with additional technology platforms that we employ to generate next-generation ADCs or bispecific antibodies. Our current research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements for biologics programs include: 
•Adagene Inc. (Adagene), which is focused on using Adagene’s SAFEbodyTM technology to develop novel masked ADCs or other innovative biologics with potential for improved therapeutic index;
•Catalent, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiaries Redwood Bioscience, Inc., R.P. Scherer Technologies, LLC and Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. (individually and collectively referred to as Catalent), which is focused on the discovery and development of multiple ADCs using Catalent’s proprietary SMARTag® site-specific bioconjugation technology;
•NBE-Therapeutics AG (NBE), which is focused on the discovery and development of multiple ADCs by leveraging NBE’s unique expertise and proprietary platforms in ADC discovery, including NBE’s SMAC-Technology™ (a site-specific conjugation technology) and novel payloads;
•Iconic Therapeutics, Inc. (Iconic), which is focused on the advancement of a next-generation ADC program targeting Tissue Factor in solid tumors; and
•Invenra, Inc. (Invenra), which is focused on the discovery and development of novel binders and multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer.
We have already made significant progress under these research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements and believe we will continue to do so in 2021, including for example, XB002, the lead Tissue Factor ADC program with Iconic (formerly ICON-2). Tissue Factor is highly expressed on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment, and Tissue Factor overexpression, while not oncogenic itself, facilitates angiogenesis, metastasis and other processes important to tumor development and progression. XB002 has continued to progress through preclinical development, and we plan to submit an IND once the drug product release assays are finalized. For additional information on these research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements related to our biologics programs, see “—Collaborations—Research Collaborations and In-licensing Arrangements.”
Collaborations
We have established multiple collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies for the commercialization and further development of the cabozantinib franchise. Additionally, we have made considerable progress under our existing research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements to further enhance our early-stage pipeline and expand our ability to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies with the goal of providing new treatment options for cancer patients and their physicians. We expect to enter into additional, external collaborative relationships around assets and technologies that complement our drug discovery and clinical development efforts. Consistent with our business strategy prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, we also entered into other collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies including Genentech and Daiichi Sankyo for other compounds and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our collaborations, we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or, in the case of cobimetinib, royalties from sales outside the U.S. and a share of profits (or losses) from commercialization in the U.S.
Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations
Ipsen Collaboration
In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the U.S., Canada and Japan. The collaboration agreement was subsequently amended on three occasions, including in December 2016 to include commercialization rights in Canada. We have also agreed to collaborate with Ipsen on the development of cabozantinib for current and potential future indications. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint steering committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction; provided, however, that we retain final decision-making authority with respect to cabozantinib’s ongoing development. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, including commercialization rights in Canada, Ipsen paid us aggregate upfront payments of $210.0 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2020, we achieved aggregate milestone payments of $350.0 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement, including milestone payments during 2020 of $20.0 million upon our achievement of a cabozantinib development milestone.
We are also eligible to receive future development and regulatory milestone payments from Ipsen, totaling an aggregate of $59.0 million upon additional approvals of cabozantinib in future indications and/or jurisdictions, as well as contingent payments of up to $450.0 million and CAD$26.5 million associated with future sales volume milestones. We will further receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen outside of the U.S. and Japan. We were initially entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 2% to 12% on the initial $150.0 million of net sales; this amount was reached in the second quarter of 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and going forward, we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% to 26% on annual net sales, with separate tiers for Canada; these 22% to 26% royalty tiers reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2020, we have earned royalties of $174.9 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement. 
Consistent with our historical agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), we are required to pay a 3% royalty to GSK on all net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Ipsen.
We are responsible for funding cabozantinib-related development costs for those trials in existence at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement with Ipsen; global development costs for additional trials are shared between the parties, with Ipsen reimbursing us for 35% of such costs, provided Ipsen chooses to opt into such trials. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Ipsen has opted into and is co-funding certain ongoing clinical trials, including COSMIC-021, COSMIC-312, CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02.
We remain responsible for manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with Ipsen to supply finished and labeled drug product to Ipsen for distribution in the territories outside of the U.S. and Japan for the term of the collaboration agreement as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a pharmacovigilance agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibilities for safety reporting. The pharmacovigilance agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from territories outside of the U.S. and Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Ipsen.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latter of (1) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib or (3) ten years after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib, other than COMETRIQ. The supply agreement will continue in effect until expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach of either the collaboration agreement or the supply agreement by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Ipsen challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. Ipsen may terminate the collaboration agreement if the FDA or EMA orders or requires substantially all cabozantinib clinical trials to be terminated. Ipsen also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on a region-by-region basis after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in advanced RCC in the given region. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Ipsen will automatically terminate, and, except in the event of a termination by 
Ipsen for our material breach, the licenses granted by Ipsen to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide, or, if Ipsen were to terminate only for a particular region, then for the terminated region. Following termination by us for Ipsen’s material breach, or termination by Ipsen without cause or because we undergo a change of control by a party engaged in a competing program, Ipsen is prohibited from competing with us for a period of time.
Takeda Collaboration
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda, which was subsequently amended effective March 2018, May 2019 and September 2020, to, among other things, modify the amount of reimbursements we receive for costs associated with our required pharmacovigilance activities and milestones we are eligible to receive, as well as modify certain cost sharing obligations related to the Japan-specific development costs associated with CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02. Pursuant to this collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan, and the parties have agreed to collaborate on the clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. The operation and strategic direction of the parties’ collaboration is governed through a joint executive committee and appropriate subcommittees.
In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50.0 million from Takeda in 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we have also achieved regulatory and development milestones in the aggregate of $92.0 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda since the inception of the collaboration agreement, including milestone payments during 2020 of (1) $31.0 million upon Takeda’s first commercial sale of CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients in Japan with curatively unresectable or metastatic RCC, (2) $10.0 million upon Takeda’s and Ono’s submission of a supplemental application to the Japanese MHLW for Manufacturing and Marketing Approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO for the treatment for patients in Japan with unresectable, advanced or metastatic RCC, (3) $10.0 million upon Takeda’s submission of a regulatory application to the Japanese MHLW for Manufacturing and Marketing Approval of cabozantinib as a treatment for patients in Japan with unresectable HCC who progressed after prior systemic therapy, and (4) $15.0 million upon Takeda’s first commercial sale of CABOMETYX as a treatment for patients in Japan with unresectable HCC who progressed after prior systemic therapy. We are eligible to receive additional regulatory and development milestone payments, without limit, for additional potential future indications. We also earned $15.0 million in milestones during the first quarter of 2021 in connection with the initiations of CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02.
We are further eligible to receive commercial milestones, including milestone payments earned for the first commercial sale of a product, of up to $139.0 million. We also receive royalties on the net sales of cabozantinib in Japan. We are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 15% to 24% on the initial $300.0 million of net sales, and following this initial $300.0 million of net sales, we are then entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 20% to 30% on annual net sales thereafter; these 20% to 30% royalty tiers reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2020, we have earned royalties of $2.3 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Takeda since the inception of the collaboration agreement.
Consistent with our historical agreement with GSK, we are required to pay a 3% royalty to GSK on all net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Takeda. 
Except for CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02, Takeda is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with the cabozantinib development plan’s current and future trials, provided Takeda opts into such trials, and 100% of costs associated with the cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Takeda has opted into and is co-funding certain cohorts of COSMIC-021, CONTACT-01 and CONTACT-02.
Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are responsible for the manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we entered into a clinical supply agreement covering the supply of cabozantinib to Takeda for the term of the collaboration agreement, as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a safety data exchange agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibility for safety reporting. This agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Takeda.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the earlier of (1) two years after first generic entry with respect to such product in Japan or (2) the later of (A) the 
expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib and (B) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib in Japan. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. For clarity, Takeda’s failure to achieve specified levels of commercial performance, based upon sales volume and/or promotional effort, during the first six years of the collaboration will constitute a material breach of the collaboration agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Takeda challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. After the commercial launch of cabozantinib in Japan, Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement upon twelve months’ prior written notice following the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in Japan. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Takeda will automatically terminate, and the licenses granted by Takeda to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide.
Cabozantinib Development Collaborations 
BMS
In February 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of exploring the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in combination with BMS’s ICIs, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, to treat a variety of types of cancer. As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating these combinations as treatment options for RCC in the CheckMate -9ER and COSMIC-313 trials and for HCC in the CheckMate 040 trial. We may also evaluate these combinations in other phase 3 pivotal trials in various other tumor types. For descriptions of the CheckMate -9ER, COSMIC-313 and CheckMate 040 trials, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with BMS.”
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement with BMS, as subsequently amended effective March 2019, May 2019 and November 2019, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (within the collaboration territory as defined in the collaboration agreement and its supplemental agreements), non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other party’s compounds in the conduct of each clinical trial. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint development committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation. Each trial will be conducted under a combination IND application, unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority. Each party will be responsible for supplying finished drug product for the applicable clinical trial, and responsibility for the payment of costs for each such trial will be determined on a trial-by-trial basis. Following the FDA’s approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, we and BMS commenced the commercial launch of the combination and have agreed to pursue commercialization and marketing efforts independently.
Roche
In February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with Roche for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement with Roche, in June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021 and in December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312. We are the sponsor of both trials, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. For descriptions of the COSMIC-021 and COSMIC-312 trials, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with Roche.”
Building upon encouraging clinical activity observed in COSMIC-021, in December 2019 we entered into a joint clinical research agreement with Roche for the purpose of further evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including in the CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02 and CONTACT-03 studies. If a party to the joint clinical research agreement proposes any additional combined therapy trials beyond these three ongoing phase 3 pivotal trials, the joint clinical research agreement provides that such proposing party must notify the other party and that if agreed to, any such additional combined therapy trial will become part of the collaboration, or if not agreed to, the proposing party may conduct such additional combined therapy trial independently, subject to specified restrictions set forth in the joint clinical research agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the joint clinical research agreement, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (excluding, in our case, territory already the subject of a license by us to Takeda), non-transferable, royalty-free license, with a right to sublicense (subject to limitations), to use the other party’s intellectual property and compounds solely as necessary for the party to perform its obligations under the joint clinical research agreement. The parties’ efforts will be governed through a joint steering committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration and the conduct of the combined therapy trials. Each party will be responsible for providing clinical supply for all combined therapy trials, and the cost of the supply will be borne by such party. The clinical trial expenses for each combined therapy trial agreed to be 
conducted jointly under the joint clinical research agreement will be shared equally between the parties, and the clinical trial expenses for each additional combined therapy trial not agreed to be conducted jointly under the joint clinical research agreement will be borne by the proposing party, except that the cost of clinical supply for all combined therapy trials will be borne by the party that owns the applicable product. 
Unless earlier terminated, the joint clinical research agreement provides that it will remain in effect until the completion of all combined therapy trials under the collaboration, the delivery of all related trial data to both parties, and the completion of any then agreed-upon additional analyses. The joint clinical research agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on any uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. Upon termination by either party, the licenses granted to each party will terminate upon completion of any ongoing activities under the joint clinical research agreement.
XL092 Clinical Collaborations
In an effort to diversify our exploration of the therapeutic potential of XL092, we have also entered into multiple supply agreements to evaluate XL092 in various combination trials, including with Roche’s atezolizumab. These supply agreements will facilitate exploration of the safety and efficacy of XL092 in combinations with multiple established cancer therapies with fixed expenses as we continue to build a broad development program for XL092. For descriptions of our ongoing clinical trials evaluating XL092 in combination with other therapies, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—XL092 Development Program.” 
Research Collaborations and In-licensing Arrangements 
Adagene
In February 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Adagene to utilize Adagene’s SAFEbody technology platform to generate masked versions of mAbs from our growing preclinical pipeline for the development of ADCs or other innovative biologics against Exelixis-nominated targets. Under the terms of the agreement, Exelixis will make an upfront payment of $11.0 million in exchange for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize any potential ADC products generated by Adagene with respect to an initial target, as well as a second target we may nominate during the collaboration term. For each target that we nominate, we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for that program. In the aggregate, Adagene will be eligible for up to $55.0 million, $200.0 million and $525.0 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, respectively, as well as royalties on potential sales of products developed around both targets.
Catalent
In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Catalent to develop multiple ADCs using Catalent’s proprietary SMARTag site-specific bioconjugation technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $10.0 million in exchange for an exclusive option to license up to four targets using Catalent’s ADC platform over a three-year period. In addition, we have the right to extend the target selection term to five years and nominate up to two additional targets for an additional payment of $4.0 million. For each option we decide to exercise, we will be required to pay an exercise fee of $2.0 million, and we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for that program. Catalent would then become eligible for up to $44.0 million per program in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and $60.0 million per program in potential commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We have also committed to contribute research funding to Catalent for discovery and preclinical development work.
NBE
In September 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with NBE to discover and develop multiple ADCs for oncology applications by leveraging NBE’s unique expertise and proprietary platforms in ADC discovery, including NBE’s SMAC-Technology and novel payloads. Under the terms of the Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $25.0 million in exchange for exclusive options to nominate four targets using NBE’s ADC platform over a two-year period. In addition, within the first 18 months of the agreement term, we also have the right to extend the target selection term to three years for an additional payment of $2.0 million. For each option we decide to exercise, we will be required to pay an exercise fee of $10.0 million, and we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization connected with any resulting program. NBE would then become eligible for up to 
$90.0 million per program in potential development and regulatory milestone payments and $135.0 million per program in potential commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We have also committed to contribute research funding to NBE for discovery and preclinical development work.
Aurigene
In July 2019, we entered into an exclusive collaboration, option and license agreement with Aurigene to in-license as many as six programs to discover and develop small molecules as therapies for cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, we made aggregate upfront payments of $17.5 million for exclusive options to license up to six programs, including three pre-existing programs. Based on encouraging preclinical data for XL102, the lead Aurigene program targeting CDK7, we exercised our exclusive option to license XL102 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of XL102 and payment of a $12.0 million option exercise fee to Aurigene. We also submitted an IND for XL102 in November 2020, and following the FDA’s acceptance of the IND in December 2020, we initiated a phase 1 clinical trial of XL102 in January 2021 designed to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy, both as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer therapies. For additional information on this new phase 1 trial, see “—Exelixis Development Programs—XL102 Development Program.” With respect to XL102, Aurigene will be eligible for up to $148.8 million in potential development and regulatory milestone payments, and $280.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. In addition, we are working with Aurigene to advance other small molecule programs through preclinical development. 
For each additional option we decide to exercise, we will be required to pay an exercise fee of $10.0 million, and we would then assume responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for that program. Aurigene would then become eligible for up to $148.8 million per program in potential development and regulatory milestone payments, $280.0 million per program in potential commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales. We are also responsible for research funding for the discovery and preclinical development work on these programs. Under the terms of the agreement, Aurigene retains limited development and commercial rights for India and Russia.
Iconic
In May 2019, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Iconic to advance an innovative next-generation ADC program for cancer, leveraging Iconic’s expertise in targeting Tissue Factor in solid tumors. Under the terms of the agreement, we gained an exclusive option to license XB002, Iconic’s lead Tissue Factor ADC program, in exchange for an upfront payment to Iconic of $7.5 million and a commitment for preclinical development funding. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we exercised our exclusive option to license XB002 in December 2020, resulting in our assuming responsibility for all subsequent clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization for XB002 and payment of a $20.0 million option exercise fee to Iconic, and we anticipate submitting an IND for XB002 once the drug product release assays are finalized. With respect to XB002, Iconic will be eligible for up to $190.6 million in potential development, regulatory and first-sale milestone payments, and $262.5 million in potential commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties on potential sales.
Invenra
In May 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Invenra to discover and develop multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Invenra is responsible for antibody lead discovery and generation while we will lead IND-enabling studies, manufacturing, clinical development in single-agent and combination therapy regimens, and future regulatory and commercialization activities. The collaboration agreement provides that we will receive an exclusive, worldwide license to one preclinical, multispecific antibody asset, and that we will pursue up to six additional discovery projects during the term of the collaboration, which in total are directed to three discovery programs. In October 2019, we expanded our collaboration to include the development of novel binders against six additional targets, which we can use to generate multispecific antibodies based on Invenra’s B-BodyTM technology platform, or with other platforms and formats at our option. In March 2020, we amended the agreement to enable the use of target binders in non-Invenra platform-based modalities, such as ADC platforms. As of December 31, 2020, we have initiated three additional discovery projects and all six binder projects. Invenra is eligible to receive up to $131.5 million in project initiation fees and milestone payments based on the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones for a B-Body product in the first indication, or in lieu of such payments, up to $43.4 million in project initiation fees and milestone payments based on the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones for a non- B-Body product. Upon successful 
commercialization of a product, Invenra is eligible to receive sales-based milestone payments up to $325.0 million as well as single-digit tiered royalties on net sales of the approved product. We have the right to initiate three additional discovery projects for development subject to an upfront payment of $2.0 million for each B-Body project, as well as additional milestone payments and royalties for any products that arise from these efforts.
StemSynergy
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with StemSynergy for the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds targeting CK1α, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in key oncogenic processes. Activation of β-catenin, a key downstream component of the pathway, is increased in multiple tumors, including a majority of colorectal cancers, where mutations in the APC gene that result in β-catenin stabilization are prevalent. Compounds targeting CK1α have also been shown to induce degradation of β-catenin and pygopus, another member of the pathway, in preclinical CRC models, and to inhibit the growth of tumors. Importantly, their GI-sparing qualities may help overcome limitations of other approaches targeting the Wnt pathway. Under the terms of the agreement, we will partner with StemSynergy to conduct preclinical and clinical studies with compounds targeting CK1α. We paid StemSynergy an upfront payment of $3.0 million in 2018. StemSynergy is eligible for up to $0.5 million in additional research and development funding on an as needed basis. StemSynergy will also be eligible for up to $56.5 million in milestones for the first product to emerge from the collaboration, including preclinical and clinical development and regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestones, as well as single-digit royalties on worldwide sales. We will be solely responsible for the commercialization of products that arise from the collaboration.
Other Collaborations
Prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, our primary business strategy was focused on the development and out-license of compounds to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaboration agreements that allowed us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products. Our collaboration agreements with Genentech and Daiichi Sankyo described below are representative of this historical strategy. We have since evolved and are now a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on driving the expansion and depth of our product offerings through the continued development of the cabozantinib franchise and drug discovery efforts, including research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements that align with our oncology drug development, regulatory and commercialization expertise, all to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer around the world. While the historical collaboration agreements described below have the potential to provide future revenue, and while we have already received some collaboration revenues from these arrangements, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these historical collaboration agreements unless and until our partnered compounds generate substantial sales in the territories and indications where they are approved. If these events occur, then the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits under our historical collaboration agreements could become substantial.
Genentech - Cobimetinib
In December 2006, we out-licensed the further development and commercialization of cobimetinib to Genentech pursuant to a worldwide collaboration agreement. Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of MEK, a kinase that is a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we developed cobimetinib through the determination of the maximum tolerated dose in a phase 1 clinical trial, and in March 2009, granted Genentech an exclusive worldwide revenue-bearing license to cobimetinib, at which point Genentech became responsible for completing the phase 1 clinical trial and subsequent clinical development. On November 10, 2015, the FDA approved cobimetinib, under the brand name COTELLIC, in combination with Genentech’s ZELBORAF (vemurafenib) as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma. COTELLIC in combination with ZELBORAF has also been approved in Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and multiple additional countries for use in the same indication. Prior to the FDA’s approval of COTELLIC, in November 2013, we exercised an option under the collaboration agreement to co-promote COTELLIC in the U.S.; however, following a review of the commercial landscape, we and Genentech scaled back the personal promotion of COTELLIC in this indication in the U.S. in January 2018. This decision is not indicative of any change in our intention to promote COTELLIC for other therapeutic indications for which it may be approved in the future. On July 30, 2020, the FDA approved COTELLIC, in combination with Genentech’s ZELBORAF and TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab) for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma in previously untreated patients. Notwithstanding this latest approval, we do not intend to co-promote COTELLIC in this indication.
Cobimetinib Profit Sharing and Royalty Revenues
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, as amended in July 2017, we share in the profits and losses received or incurred in connection with COTELLIC’s commercialization in the U.S. This profit and loss share has multiple tiers: we receive 50% of profits and losses from the first $200.0 million of U.S. actual sales, decreasing to 30% of profits and losses from U.S. actual sales in excess of $400.0 million. These tiers reset each calendar year. The revenue for each sale of COTELLIC applied to the profit and loss statement for the collaboration agreement (Genentech Collaboration P&L) is calculated using the average of the quarterly net selling prices of COTELLIC and any additional branded Genentech product(s) prescribed with COTELLIC in such sale. U.S. commercialization costs for COTELLIC are then applied to the Genentech Collaboration P&L, subject to reduction based on the number of Genentech products in any given combination including COTELLIC. In addition to our profit share in the U.S., under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are entitled to low double-digit royalties on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. During 2020, we earned royalties of $5.1 million on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. and a $6.3 million profit on the profit and loss sharing of U.S. actual sales which are recorded in Collaboration services revenues. Since the inception of the collaboration agreement, we have also received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $50.0 million and are not eligible for any additional milestone payments.
Cobimetinib Clinical Development Program 
In addition to its established commercialization of COTELLIC, Genentech continues to progress the clinical development, regulatory status and commercial potential of cobimetinib. Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program consisting of more than 50 clinical trials by Genentech or through Genentech’s IST program, including an ongoing phase 1b trial exploring the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, as well as additional clinical trials investigating the combination of cobimetinib and other therapies in multiple tumor settings. Should these trials prove positive and Genentech obtain regulatory approvals based on such positive results, we believe that cobimetinib could provide us with an additional source of revenue in the future.
Melanoma - coBRIM. In July 2014, we announced positive top-line results from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial conducted by Genentech evaluating cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. CoBRIM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of COTELLIC in combination with ZELBORAF as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the U.S., Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries.
Melanoma - IMspire150. In December 2019, we announced positive results from IMspire150, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib, vemurafenib and atezolizumab vs. cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. IMspire150 served as the basis for the July 2020 regulatory approval of the combination of TECENTRIQ, COTELLIC and ZELBORAF for the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma in previously untreated patients in the U.S.
Daiichi Sankyo - Esaxerenone
In March 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against the MR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate MR, including esaxerenone, an oral, non-steroidal, selective MR antagonist. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for all further preclinical and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the compounds and we do not have rights to reacquire such compounds, except as described below. During the research term, which concluded in November 2007, we jointly identified drug candidates with Daiichi Sankyo for further development. Esaxerenone is the only remaining drug candidate identified under the collaboration that continues to be developed by Daiichi Sankyo, and we are entitled to receive payments upon attainment of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones for esaxerenone.
In September 2017, Daiichi Sankyo reported positive top-line results from ESAX-HTN, a phase 3 pivotal trial of esaxerenone, and submitted a Japanese regulatory application for esaxerenone for an essential hypertension indication in February 2018. Daiichi Sankyo’s application was then approved by the MHLW in January 2019, and the first commercial sale of the branded esaxerenone product MINNEBRO in Japan in May 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we have received an 
aggregate of $65.5 million in development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments related to MINNEBRO over the life of the collaboration agreement and are eligible to receive commercialization milestone payments of up to $90.0 million. In addition, we are entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on sales of MINNEBRO. Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ written notice, in which case Daiichi Sankyo’s payment obligations would cease, its license relating to compounds that modulate MR would terminate and revert to us and we would receive, subject to certain terms and conditions, licenses from Daiichi Sankyo to research, develop and commercialize compounds that were discovered under the collaboration. In addition, pursuant to a license agreement we entered into with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ligand), we are required to pay a royalty of 0.5% to Ligand on net sales of MINNEBRO. As of December 31, 2020, we have earned royalties of $1.5 million on net sales of MINNEBRO by Daiichi Sankyo since the approval of MINNEBRO in January 2019.
Daiichi Sankyo also continues to advance the development program for esaxerenone, and in November 2019, Daiichi Sankyo announced positive results from a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating esaxerenone as a treatment option for patients in Japan with diabetic nephropathy. Should Daiichi Sankyo obtain regulatory approval based on these positive results, and taking into account the approval of MINNEBRO by the MHLW for the treatment of hypertension and Daiichi Sankyo’s subsequent commercial sales of MINNEBRO, we believe that esaxerenone will provide an additional source of revenue in the future.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or resources for chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) development activities, preclinical, clinical or commercial production and distribution for our current products. Instead, we rely on various third-party contract manufacturing organizations to conduct these operations on our behalf. As our operations continue to grow in these areas, we continue to expand our supply chain through secondary third-party contract manufacturers, distributors and suppliers. Specifically, we entered into agreements with secondary contract manufacturing organizations to produce additional commercial supplies of CABOMETYX tablets and cabozantinib drug substance, which bolsters our commercial supply chain and serves to mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions or other failures. For our portfolio of small molecules and biologics, we have selected well-established and reputable global third-party contract manufacturers for our CMC development, drug substance and drug product manufacturing that have good regulatory standing, large manufacturing capacities and multiple manufacturing sites within their business footprint. These third parties must comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), the EC’s Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice (GDP), as well as other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, as applicable, and are subject to routine inspections by such regulatory agencies. In addition, through our third-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we continue to provide serialized commercial products as required to comply with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).
We monitor and evaluate the performance of our third-party contract manufacturers on an ongoing basis for compliance with these requirements and to affirm their continuing capabilities to meet both our commercial and clinical needs. We also have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, with multiple distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our third-party contract manufacturers and other supply chain partners, and our quality department audits them on a periodic basis.
We source raw materials that are used to manufacture our drug substance from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe. We stock sufficient quantities of these materials and provide them to our third-party drug substance contract manufacturers so they can manufacture adequate drug substance quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We then store drug substance at third-party facilities and provide appropriate amounts to our third-party drug product contract manufacturers, who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for COMETRIQ and CABOMETYX, respectively. In addition, we rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to source materials such as excipients, components and reagents, which are required to manufacture our drug substance and finished drug product.
In addition to having expanded our supply chain to include secondary contract manufacturing organizations, we have established and continue to maintain substantial safety stock inventories for our drug substance and drug products, and we store these quantities in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for market demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our drug substance and drug products. While our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included more frequent engagement with our vendors to maintain the consistency and effectiveness of our third-party contract manufacturers and other supply chain 
partners, we have not experienced production delays or seen significant impairment to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of CABOMETYX to support the currently approved advanced RCC and HCC indications, as well as potential additional indications if trials evaluating CABOMETYX in those indications prove to be successful and gain regulatory approval in the future. Our manufacturing footprint also enables us to fulfill our supply obligations for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to our collaboration partners for global development and commercial purposes.
Marketing and Sales
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We market our products in the U.S. and concentrate our efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. In addition to using customary pharmaceutical company practices, we have also adopted digital marketing technologies to engage with customers. Our reliance on digital marketing increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which required us to shift from in-person to primarily telephonic and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our commercial products, CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, are sold initially through wholesale distribution and specialty pharmacy channels and then, if applicable, resold to hospitals and other organizations that provide CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to end-user patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the U.S., we also employ various third parties, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and vendors providing other sales-support related services as needed, including digital marketing and other non-personal promotion. We believe that our commercial team and distribution practices are sufficient to facilitate our marketing efforts in reaching our target audience and our delivery of our products to patients in a timely and compliant fashion.
In addition, we rely on Ipsen and Takeda for ongoing and further commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX in territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs or similar programs with the effect of introducing earlier patient access to CABOMETYX, and we also rely on Ipsen for these same activities with respect to the commercialization and distribution of COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. For COTELLIC, we rely on Genentech, as our collaboration partner, for all current and future commercialization and marketing activities, with the exception of the limited co-promotion activities highlighted above.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the U.S. have appropriate access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and patient support program called Exelixis Access Services (EASE). Through EASE, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, EASE provides comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support, benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. While we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, we do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Laboratory Safety Program
Due to the focus of our business in discovering and developing drug products, many of our employees work in our on-site laboratory facilities. All new laboratory staff are trained on chemical hygiene, the use of personal protective equipment, and certain other relevant laboratory safety topics, such as working with blood-borne pathogens, and current staff are retrained regularly. We also extend these trainings to facilities staff and others who support our work in the labs. To maintain a safe environment for all staff, we regularly perform thorough safety inspections of our laboratories, and continuously update our procedures based on the observations made during these inspections. Additionally, we conduct periodic industrial hygiene monitoring to ensure lab staff working with certain known hazardous chemicals do not exceed regulated exposure limits, and we regularly test and certify fume hoods, biosafety cabinets and other individual pieces of equipment on which employees rely to maintain a safe work environment.
Workplace Safety Measures in Response to COVID-19
The health and safety of our staff members has remained a top priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, ahead of the shelter in place orders issued by the State of California and Alameda County, we implemented a work-from-home policy for all of our employees other than minimal on-site staffing to maintain critical infrastructure operations. During the months that followed, we implemented numerous additional precautions and enhanced safety and social distancing protocols to help diminish the risk of transmission of the virus as certain employees began to return to working at our Alameda, California headquarters in June 2020. In particular, we reduced the number of employees working on-site to primarily those laboratory and site operations personnel required to continue our important drug discovery work, provided such employees were comfortable working on-site. These staff members – already familiar with personal protective equipment and enhanced safety measures – have undergone additional detailed training on our COVID-19 safety and social distancing protocols that are necessary to safely perform their job duties in our on-site facilities.
We also offer on-site, rapid PCR COVID-19 testing, and utilize a mobile device app and web interface for our team members who regularly work at our headquarters, which enables registered users to schedule their on-site tests at Exelixis and provides them with daily symptom tracking, as well as contact tracing and educational resources for any team member who may have tested positive.
We will continue to monitor the latest guidance issued by health authorities and have instituted several policies and procedures to protect against the spread of COVID-19 among our workforce. These policies and procedures currently include frequent disinfection of common areas by our operations staff and investments in re-engineering workspace safety, such as installing plexiglass partitions, providing ample supplies of hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes and facemasks for use by our staff, and adjusting our ventilation systems in an effort to minimize risks of airborne transmission. Although having most of our employees continue to work remotely has required us to devise new ways of working and collaborating, to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has only had a modest impact on our productivity and has not caused significant interruptions in our general business operations. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Update” in Part II, Item 7 and of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Clinical Development
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, marketing approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, post-marketing safety reporting, export, import, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, some of which must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP);
•submission of an IND, which contains results of nonclinical studies (e.g., laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity of the product candidate), together with manufacturing information, analytical 
data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials conducted in accordance with the protocol, IND and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug candidate for its proposed intended use;
•for drug products, submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for commercial marketing, or generally of an sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
•for biological products, submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for commercial marketing, or generally a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
•pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators, clinical trial sites and/or Exelixis as the clinical trial sponsor for their compliance with GMP and GCP, respectively;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of an NDA or BLA unless a fee waiver applies;
•agreement with the FDA on the final labeling for the product;
•if the FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and
•FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA, or BLA or sBLA.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 - Studies, which involve the initial introduction of a new drug product candidate into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or patients. In rare cases, a Phase 1 study that is designed to assess effectiveness may serve as the basis for FDA marketing approval of a drug or for a label expansion. For instance, at FDA’s discretion, a product may receive approval based on a Phase 1b study if effectiveness results from the study are extremely compelling, approval of the drug would address a significant unmet patient need, and the drug is being approved through the Accelerated Approval pathway. As discussed below, Accelerated Approval generally requires a post-approval study to confirm clinical benefit.
•Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosage, and common short-term side effect and risks associated with the drug. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects.
•Phase 3 - When earlier phase evaluations provide preliminary evidence suggesting that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, phase 3 trials are performed to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called phase 4 studies may be deemed a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval. 
FDA Review and Approval
For approval of a new drug or changes to an approved drug, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or as part of an sNDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions, although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or sNDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical and/or nonclinical data and/or an additional phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Satisfaction of FDA development and approval requirements or similar requirements 
of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including obtaining prior FDA approval of certain changes to the approved NDA, record-keeping requirements, and reporting of adverse experiences with, and interruptions in the manufacture of, the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Thus, we and our third-party contract manufacturing organizations are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain manufacturing requirements (including procedural and documentation requirements) upon us and our third-party contract manufacturing organizations.
In the U.S., the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, provides incentives for the development of drugs and biological products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. (or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.). Certain of the incentives turn on the drug first being designated as an orphan drug. To be eligible for designation as an orphan drug (Orphan Drug Designation), the drug must have the potential to treat such rare disease or condition as described above. In addition, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as defined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication or the sponsor of the subsequent drug must provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved same drug. Upon receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 25% for qualified clinical trial expenses and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity if no drug considered the same drug was previously approved for the same orphan condition (or if the subsequent drug is demonstrated to be clinically superior to any such previously approved same drug). Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break an approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
The FDA has various programs that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Examples of such programs included Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, and the eligibility criteria of and benefits for each program vary: 
•Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions that demonstrate the potential to fill unmet medical needs, by providing, among other things, eligibility for accelerated approval if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or for FDA review before the entire submission is completed. 
•Breakthrough therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, and rolling review.
•Priority review is designed to shorten the review period for drugs that treat serious conditions and that, if approved, would offer significant advances in safety or effectiveness or would provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Under priority review, the FDA aims to take action on the application within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Sponsors may also obtain a priority review voucher upon approval of an NDA for certain qualifying diseases and conditions that can be applied to a subsequent NDA submission
•Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, or a certain intermediate clinical endpoint, reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing 
clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. The failure to conduct such trials, or confirm the clinically meaningful outcome in such trials, may result in withdrawal of the NDA.
Specifically, with respect to oncology products, the FDA may review applications under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program established by the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. The RTOR pilot program, which allows an applicant to pre-submit components of the application to allow the FDA to review clinical data before the complete filings is submitted, aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while maintaining and improving review quality. Drugs considered for review under the RTOR pilot program must be likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted breakthrough therapy designation for the same or other indications, and must have straight-forward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted.
In addition, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (The Hatch-Waxman Act) established two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products in which potential competitors may rely upon the FDA’s prior approval of the same or similar drug product.
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA may be approved by the FDA if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed generic product is the same as the approved drug, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness through clinical development. Conducting bioequivalence testing is generally less time consuming and costly than conducting a full set of clinical trials in humans. In this regard, the FDA has published draft guidance containing product-specific bioequivalence recommendations for drug products containing cabozantinib, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, as it does for many FDA-approved drug products.
505(b)(2) NDAs. A 505(b)(2) application is one for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), an applicant may rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. If the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies. The FDA may require additional studies or measurements, including comparability studies.
Unlike a full NDA for which the sponsor has conducted or obtained a right of reference to all the data essential to approval, the filing of an ANDA application or a 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides (a) up to five years of exclusivity for the first approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity and (b) three years of exclusivity for approval of an NDA or sNDA for a product that is not an NCE but rather where the application contains new clinical studies conducted or sponsored by the sponsor and considered essential to the approval of the NDA or sNDA (three-year “changes” exclusivity). NCE exclusivity runs from the time of approval of the NDA and bars FDA from accepting for review of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug containing the same active moiety for five years (or for four years if the application contains a Paragraph IV certification that a reference product patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA/505(b)(2) product). The three-year “changes” exclusivity generally bars the FDA from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the information supporting the approval of the drug or the change to the drug for which the information was submitted and the exclusivity granted.
Orange Book Listing. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also submit a statement that it intends to carve-out from the labeling of its product an RLD’s use that is protected by exclusivity or a method of use patent. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification 
must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. Filing such a lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not receive final approval until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired. We intend to defend vigorously any patents for our approved products.
In September 2019, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter from MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MSN), that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets, which MSN then amended with additional Paragraph IV certifications in May 2020. In response, we filed patent infringement lawsuits against MSN on October 29, 2019 and May 11, 2020, which were later consolidated. For a more detailed discussion of this litigation matter, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Approval Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
The way clinical trials are conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when Regulation (EU) 536/2014 governing clinical trials in the EU, repealing the existing Directive 2001/20/EC, comes into application. Once fully implemented, this regulation will harmonize the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU, via an EU portal and database. The EMA will set up and maintain the portal and database, in collaboration with the Member States and the EC. Although Regulation (EU) 536/2014 was adopted and entered into force in 2014, the timing of its application depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit. Regulation (EU) 536/2014 will then become applicable six months after the EC publishes notice of this confirmation. The system's go-live date has been postponed several times due to technical difficulties with the development of the information technology systems. At its meeting held in June 2020, the EMA Management Board endorsed the methodology and next steps to further develop the CTIS “Go-Live” plan. As a working assumption, it is proposed to fix the “Go-Live” date of CTIS to December 2021, which means the Clinical Trial Regulation would also enter in application at that time (i.e., the end of the six-month period after the EC publishes its notice in the Official Journal of the European Union).
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA for scientific review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) so that an opinion is issued on product approvability. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for granting the centralized marketing authorization in the form of a binding EC decision. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, collectively the European Economic Area. The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national authorization procedure are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the EU member states selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another member state, referred to as the Reference Member State (RMS). The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any member state. Under this procedure the applicant can select the member state that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the member states where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each Concerned Member State must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment. If a member state does not agree with the assessment and the disputed points cannot be resolved, the matter is eventually referred to the Coordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures in the first instance to reach an agreement and failing to reach such an agreement, a referral to the EMA and the CHMP for arbitration that will result in an opinion to form the basis of a decision to be issued by the EC binding on all member states. If the 
application is successful during the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the member states chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted in the centralized procedure for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in EU law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU, orphan designation is available for products in development which are either: (a) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU; or (b) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the Community and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for orphan drug designation must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan drugs in the EU enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant for a similar medicinal product can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Healthcare and Privacy Regulation 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also govern our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid; the FDCA and its implementing regulations, which prohibit, among other things, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated or misbranded; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a governmental healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (CCPA), went into operation on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action related to certain data security breaches. These protections will be expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. There are similar legislative proposals being advanced in other states, as well as in Congress. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we may obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not considered to be a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, we could be subject to penalties if we use or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including laws in all 50 states requiring security breach notification in some circumstances. The CCPA, CPRA, HIPAA and these other laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. International laws, such as the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), could also apply to our operations. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with applicable privacy laws could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (PPACA) created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family during the previous calendar year. Beginning in 2022, manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its relationships with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. There are also an increasing number of state laws that control pharmaceutical product pricing or require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Because our products are covered in the U.S. by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require us to pay substantial rebates or offer our drugs at substantial discounts to certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount our products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas and regulatory guidance, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources. Failure to properly calculate prices, or to offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our approved products and any future products of ours will depend, in part, on the extent to which their costs will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Each third-party payer may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not guarantee what reimbursement rate, if any, will be approved. Patients may be less likely to use our products if coverage is not provided and reimbursement may not cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
In the U.S. and other potentially significant markets for our products, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which may result in lower average selling prices. In some cases, for example, third-party payers try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country-specific and national pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing coverage and/or reimbursement controls and measures, could have a material adverse impact on our net product revenues and results of operations.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering proposals or have enacted legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. 
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. In particular, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules, as well as Executive Orders, designed to, among other things: reduce or limit the prices of drugs and make them more affordable for patients (including, for example, by tying the prices that Medicare reimburses for physician-administered drugs to the prices of drugs in other countries); reform the structure and financing of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits, including through increasing manufacturer contributions to offset Medicare beneficiary costs; bring more transparency to drug pricing rationale and methodologies; enable the government to negotiate prices under Medicare; revise rules associated with the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price under Medicaid, which affect the amount of rebates that we pay on prescription drugs under Medicaid and to covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Program; eliminate the AKS discount safe harbor protection for manufacturer rebate arrangements with Medicare Part D plan sponsors; create new AKS safe harbors applicable to certain point-of-sale discounts to patients and fixed fee administrative fee payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers; and facilitate the importation of certain lower-cost drugs from other countries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative.
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly impacted by major legislative initiatives and related political contests. For instance, efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA, some of which have been successful, create considerable uncertainties for all businesses involved in healthcare, including our own. In addition, there are pending federal and state-level legislative proposals that would significantly expand government-provided health insurance coverage, ranging from establishing a single-payer, national health insurance system to more limited “buy-in” options to existing public health insurance programs, each of which could have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. It is also possible that additional governmental actions will be taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and that such actions would have a significant impact on these public health insurance programs.
As a result of these developments and trends, third-party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. These entities could refuse, limit or condition coverage for our products, such as by using tiered reimbursement or pressing for new forms of contracting, including, for example, the movement by insurers towards “value-based” contracting, any of which could adversely affect product sales. Due to general uncertainty in the current regulatory and healthcare policy environment, and specifically regarding positions that the new Biden Administration may take with respect to these issues, we are unable to predict the impact of any legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, including potential cost containment and healthcare reform measures.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare system. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, EU Member States may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. Pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities or payers in EU member states can take six to 12 months or longer after the initial marketing authorization is granted for a product, or after the marketing authorization for a new indication is granted. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, drug manufacturers and collaboration partners may also be required to conduct a study that seeks to establish the cost effectiveness of a new drug compared with other available established therapies. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls, reimbursement limitations or other requirements for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in countries in the EU do not follow the price structures of the U.S. and they generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
Competition 
There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules, antibodies and other treatments for cancer. Our competitors and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and 
development staff and facilities, deeper regulatory expertise and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may afford them a competitive advantage.
Competition for Cabozantinib
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:
•efficacy, safety and reliability of cabozantinib, both alone and in combination with other therapies;
•timing and scope of regulatory approval;
•the speed at which we develop cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types beyond its approved indications;
•our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib, both alone and in combination with other therapies;
•our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of cabozantinib product to the market;
•our ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib, both as a single agent and as part of any combination therapy regimen, and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement in approved indications;
•product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;
•the level of our collaboration partners’ investments in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize cabozantinib, or any combination therapy regimen that includes cabozantinib, in territories where they are approved; 
•skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;
•protection of our intellectual property, including our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against potential generic competition; and
•the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.
We believe that the quality and breadth of activity observed with cabozantinib, the skill of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and drug development are competitive strengths. However, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do, more substantial capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
The markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib are becoming increasingly competitive. In addition to cancer treatments that are already approved in these markets, we are aware of products in research or development by our competitors that are intended to treat all of the tumor types we are targeting, and should they demonstrate suitable clinical evidence, any of these products may compete with cabozantinib or any combination therapy regimen that includes cabozantinib. Given the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy, we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to achieve positive clinical trial results for therapies combining cabozantinib with ICIs across multiple indications, and if approved, successfully commercialize such combination therapies. While we have had success in adapting our development strategy for the cabozantinib franchise to address the expanding role of therapies that combine ICIs with other targeted agents, including the recent FDA approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, we cannot ensure that our current and future clinical trials, including those evaluating cabozantinib in combination with an ICI in HCC, NSCLC and mCRPC, will lead to regulatory approvals, or whether physicians will prescribe regimens containing cabozantinib instead of competing product combinations. Moreover, the complexities of such a development strategy have required and are likely to continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.
Below is a summary of the principal competition for cabozantinib in the indications for which it is approved or for which it has been or is currently being evaluated in potentially label-enabling trials, both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies. The information below does not include all competitor products, but rather those approved products that have or we anticipate will capture significant market share within their respective indications, or with respect to therapies still in development, those that are likely to overlap with patient populations that are or may be treated with cabozantinib or a combination therapy regimen that includes cabozantinib.
Competition in Approved Cabozantinib Indications
CABOMETYX - RCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC includes: the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib; the combination of BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab; 
Pfizer’s sunitinib; and Novartis’ pazopanib. Additionally, there are a variety of therapies being developed for advanced RCC, including: the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; Peloton Therapeutics’ (a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co.) belzutifan (also known as MK-6482); the combination of Peloton Therapeutics’ belzutifan and Eisai’s lenvatinib; and generic versions of sunitinib.
 The competitive landscape for RCC is evolving rapidly, especially given the entrance of ICI and ICI-TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape, particularly in the first-line setting. This will lead to new trends in prescribing and sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. It is therefore difficult to predict how these changes will affect sales of CABOMETYX during 2021 and going forward.
CABOMETYX - HCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in previously treated HCC includes: Bayer’s regorafenib; and Eisai’s levantinib.
The competitive landscape for HCC is also changing with the increased adoption of ICI combination therapies in the first-line setting, which may lead to an increase in prescribing and sequencing of TKIs in subsequent treatment indications. It is therefore difficult to predict how these changes will affect sales of CABOMETYX during 2021 and going forward.
COMETRIQ - MTC: We believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is Genzyme’s vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EC for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease, as well as other therapies that have been recently approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, including: Blueprint Medicine’s and Roche’s pralsetinib; and Loxo Oncology’s (a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly) selpercatinib.
Other than the recent approvals of RET inhibitors to treat certain MTC patients, there has been little change in the treatment landscape for progressive, metastatic MTC during recent years, and due to the limited number of ongoing late-stage clinical trials in this indication, we do not expect many additional competitors to emerge in 2021. 
Competition in Potential Cabozantinib Indications
Cabozantinib - DTC: We have announced positive results from the first 100 patients randomized in COSMIC-311, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in patients with DTC who have progressed after up to two prior VEGF receptor-targeted therapies. Should cabozantinib be approved for this indication of DTC, we believe its principal competition may include two treatments that are also approved for previously untreated DTC: Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. There may also be competition from therapies approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are RAI-refractory (if RAI is appropriate), including: Blueprint Medicine’s and Roche’s pralsetinib; and Loxo Oncology’s selpercatinib.
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI - HCC: We have initiated COSMIC-312, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with previously untreated HCC. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced HCC, we believe its principal competition may include: the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; and the combination of Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab.
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI – NSCLC: We are evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in COSMIC-021, a phase 1b trial in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including NSCLC, and we have also initiated CONTACT-01, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI and platinum-containing chemotherapy. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, we believe its principal competition may include: Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Sanofi’s docetaxel and Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab; the combination of BMS’ nivolumab and Mirati’s sitravatinib; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; and generic versions of docetaxel.
Cabozantinib in combination with ICI – mCRPC: We are evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in COSMIC-021, a phase 1b trial in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including mCRPC, and we have also initiated CONTACT-02, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with mCRPC who have been previously treated with one novel hormonal therapy. Based on regulatory feedback from the FDA, and if supported by the clinical data, we intend to file with the FDA for accelerated approval in an mCRPC indication in 2021. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with mCRPC, we 
believe its principal competition may include: Janssen Biotech’s (a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) abiraterone; Astellas Pharma’s and Pfizer’s enzalutamide; Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Sanofi’s docetaxel; the combination of Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab and Astellas Pharma’s and Pfizer’s enzalutamide; the combination of BMS’ nivolumab and Sanofi’s docetaxel; and generic versions of abiraterone and docetaxel.
Competition for Cobimetinib
We believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition amongst targeted agents includes: the combination of Array’s encorafenib and binimetinib; and the combination of Novartis’ trametinib and dabrafenib. Within the class of ICIs, we believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition includes: the combination of BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab; and Merck & Co.’s pembrolizumab. The second category, ICIs, are of particular competitive importance vis-a-vis cobimetinib in advanced melanoma as they are already FDA approved in melanoma patient populations that overlap with those that may be eligible for cobimetinib, they have been rapidly incorporated into the NCCN treatment guidelines, and they are viewed with a high degree of enthusiasm by physicians and key opinion leaders. Ongoing and future trials incorporating ICIs, including combination trials, may further impact usage of cobimetinib in melanoma and potentially in additional tumor types in which cobimetinib may ultimately gain approval.
Competition for Esaxerenone
We believe that esaxerenone’s principal competition for the treatment of hypertension in Japan will be Bayer’s MR antagonist, finerenone, if and when it is approved by the MHLW. Finerenone is still in development for this indication, and results from ongoing clinical studies are still forthcoming. Other potential competitors for the treatment of hypertension in Japan, if and when they are approved by the MHLW, include: Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ canagliflozin; Reata Pharmaceuticals’ bardoxolone methyl; and Gilead Sciences’ selonsertib.
We believe that esaxerenone’s principal competition for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in Japan will be finerenone, if and when it is approved by the MHLW. 
Significant Customers
We operate as a single business segment and have operations solely in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 15% of our revenues from Ipsen, 14% of our revenues from affiliates of CVS Health Corporation, 12% of our revenues from affiliates of McKesson Corporation, 11% of our revenues from affiliates of Optum Specialty Pharmacy and 11% of our revenues from affiliates of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. See “Note 2. Revenues” to our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about significant customers in prior years. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek patent protection in the U.S., Europe and selected other foreign countries to cover our drug candidates and related technologies. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have numerous patents and pending patent applications that relate to methods of screening drug targets, compounds that modulate drug targets, as well as methods of making and using such compounds.
While many patent applications have been filed relating to the drug candidates that we have developed, the majority of these are not yet issued or allowed. To our knowledge, we own all global patents associated with cabozantinib and cobimetinib, and we either own or have in-licensed all global patents for our other drug candidates, as further described below.
Cabozantinib
Cabozantinib is covered by more than 10 issued patents in the U.S., building from U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,473, for the composition-of-matter of cabozantinib (the ‘473 Patent) and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. This composition of matter patent would expire in September 2024, but we have been granted a patent term extension to extend the term to August 2026. The following table describes the US patents that cover our marketed cabozantinib products, and which are listed in the Orange Book. Except as otherwise noted, the stated expiration dates include any patent term extensions 
already granted. In addition to the composition of matter patent referenced above, the table includes patents directed to, among other things, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our cabozantinib products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.

Product | Patent No. | General Subject Matter | Patent Expiration
CABOMETYX | 7,579,473 | Composition of matter | 2026 
8,497,284 | Methods of treatment | 2024 
8,877,776 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib | 2030 
9,724,342 | Formulations of cabozantinib | 2033 
10,039,757 | Methods of treatment | 2031 
10,034,873 | Methods of treatment | 2031 
COMETRIQ | 7,579,473 | Composition of matter | 2026 
8,877,776 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib | 2030 
9,717,720 | Formulations of cabozantinib | 2032 

Given the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise with respect to patents and patent applications required for the commercialization of medicines containing cabozantinib. For example, in September 2019, we received a notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by MSN, requesting approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets. MSN’s initial notice letter included a Paragraph IV certification with respect to our U.S. Patent Nos. 8,877,776, 9,724,342, 10,034,873 and 10,039,757, which are listed in the Orange Book. MSN’s initial notice letter did not provide a Paragraph IV certification against the ‘473 Patent, which expires on August 16, 2026, or U.S. Patent No. 8,497,284, which expires on September 24, 2024. On October 29, 2019, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against MSN asserting U.S. Patent No. 8,877,776 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Federal Court) arising from MSN’s ANDA filing with the FDA. On May 5, 2020, we received notice from MSN that it had amended its ANDA to assert additional Paragraph IV certifications. The ANDA now requests approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets prior to expiration of the two previously-unasserted CABOMETYX patents: the ‘473 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 8,497,284. On May 11, 2020, we filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for patent infringement against MSN asserting the ‘473 Patent and U.S. Patent No. 8,497,284 arising from MSN’s amended ANDA filing with the FDA. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit or assure you that the lawsuit will prevent the introduction of a generic version of CABOMETYX for any particular length of time, or at all. For a more detailed discussion of this litigation matter, see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In Europe, cabozantinib is protected by issued patents covering the composition-of-matter and methods of use. The issued patent would expire in September 2024, but we have applied for and either have obtained, or expect to obtain Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe to extend the term to 2029. In addition to the composition of matter patent, the table below includes later-expiring patents directed to the commercial product, including, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. 

Product | Patent No. | General Subject Matter | Patent Expiration
CABOMETYX | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 
COMETRIQ | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 

Similarly, in Japan, cabozantinib is protected by an issued patent covering the composition-of-matter, and salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. We intend to apply for patent term extension in Japan to extend the term to 2029. Foreign counterparts of the issued U.S. and European composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia and Canada and are anticipated to expire in 2024. We have other filed patent applications and 
issued patents in the U.S. and other selected countries covering certain synthetic methods, salts, polymorphs, formulations, prodrugs, metabolites and combinations of cabozantinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire as late as 2035. Outside the U.S. and Japan, cabozantinib is licensed to Ipsen; in Japan cabozantinib is licensed to Takeda, each in accordance with the respective collaboration agreements. A discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and other proprietary rights is set forth in “Risk Factors,” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Drug Candidates
We also have issued patents and pending patent applications, and will continue to file new patent applications, in the U.S., Europe and other selected countries covering our other drug candidates in clinical and/or preclinical development, including XL092, XL102 and XB002.
We have obtained licenses from various parties that give us rights to technologies that we deem to be necessary or desirable for our research and development. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) may require us to pay royalties as well as upfront and milestone payments.
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We also require all of our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive proprietary information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all proprietary information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Furthermore, our agreements with employees and, in most circumstances, our agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors expressly provide that all inventions, concepts, developments, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property developed by an employee during the employment period, or developed by a service provider during the service period or utilizing our proprietary drugs or information, shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Human Capital Management
Our Employees and Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
As of December 31, 2020, we had 773 full-time equivalent employees, representing a 25% increase in our employee workforce as compared to December 31, 2019. Of these employees, 409 are members of our various research and development teams and 364 are members of our various commercial and general and administrative teams. Of these employees, 126 hold Ph.D. degrees, 12 hold M.D. (or foreign equivalent) degrees, 20 hold PharmD degrees and 65 hold other professional degrees such as a J.D. or M.B.A. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
During the past five years, our employee turnover has remained consistently below average for the U.S. life sciences industry generally, as well as for life sciences companies located in northern California. Given our expanding operations and need to further grow our headcount to support our business, we continually assess employee turnover, recruitment initiatives, compensation and benefits programs, safety in performing critical laboratory work, diversity and other matters relevant to human capital management, and we review results with our Board of Directors on a periodic basis.
We are an equal opportunity employer and maintain policies that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital and veteran status. We are proud to employ a diverse workforce that, as December 31, 2020, was 52% non-white and 53% women. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, 48% of our positions that manage other employees directly were held by non-whites and 46% were held by women, and women made up 33% of our senior leadership team. We strive to build and nurture a culture where all employees feel empowered to be their authentic selves. We respect and appreciate each employee’s unique perspective and experiences, and value their contribution to our mission. It is important that we celebrate, encourage and support similarities and differences to drive innovation for the benefit of our employees, patients and community.
Culture, Compensation and Benefits
At Exelixis, we value being exceptional in what we do and how we lead, excelling for patients by going the extra mile to care for them and exceeding together as a business and contributor to the scientific community. We strive to live these values every day across the company, integrating them into everything from our interview, hiring and onboarding processes, to our performance evaluation, rewards and promotion programs.
We provide generous compensation packages designed to attract and retain high-quality employees, and all of our employees are eligible for cash bonuses and grants of equity awards. We regularly evaluate our compensation programs with an independent compensation consultant and utilize industry benchmarking in an effort to ensure they are competitive compared to similar biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies with which we compete for talent, as well as fair and equitable across our workforce with respect to gender, race and other personal characteristics. In addition, we are proud to provide a variety of programs and services to help employees meet and balance their needs at work, at home and in life, including an attractive mix of healthcare, insurance and other benefit plans. We deliver a benefits program that is designed to keep our employees and their families healthy, which includes not only medical, dental and vision benefits, but also dependent care, mental health and other wellness benefits. For a discussion of workplace safety measures we have taken, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “—Environmental, Health and Safety.” 
Beyond compensation, we also value career development for all employees, and we offer a tuition reimbursement program, as well as professional development courses ranging from technical training, competency-based workshops and leadership development programs facilitated by external partners who are experts in their respective fields. Direct managers also take an active role in identifying individualized development plans to assist their employees in realizing their full potential and creating opportunities for promotions and added responsibilities that enhance the engagement and retention of our workforce.
