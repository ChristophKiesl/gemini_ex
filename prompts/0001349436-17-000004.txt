Item 1.        Business
GENERAL
SandRidge Energy, Inc. is an oil and natural gas company with a principal focus on exploration and production activities in the Mid-Continent and Rockies regions of the United States. The Company’s Rockies properties were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had 3,122 gross (2,310.0 net) producing wells, a substantial portion of which it operates, and approximately 1,364,000 gross (950,000 net) total acres under lease. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had one rig drilling in the Mid-Continent. Total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 were 163.9 MMBoe, of which approximately 74% were proved developed.
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 123 Robert S. Kerr Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102 and the Company’s telephone number is (405) 429-5500. SandRidge makes available free of charge on its website at www.sandridgeenergy.com its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any materials that the Company has filed with the SEC may be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington D.C. 20549 or accessed via the SEC’s website address at www.sec.gov. The public may also obtain information about the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
Reorganization Under Chapter 11 and Emergence from Bankruptcy
On May 16, 2016, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors’ joint plan of reorganization on September 9, 2016 (as amended, the “Plan”), and the Debtors’ subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on October 4, 2016 (the “Emergence Date”). The Company’s Chapter 11 reorganization and related matters are addressed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Note 1- Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings ” and “Note 2 - Fresh Start Accounting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
The reorganization under Chapter 11 substantially reduced indebtedness and restructured the Company’s balance sheet. Throughout the course of the Chapter 11 reorganization, we were able to conduct normal business activities and pay associated obligations for the period following the bankruptcy filing and paid certain pre-petition obligations, including employee wages and benefits, goods and services provided by certain vendors, transportation of our production, and royalties and costs incurred on the Company’s behalf by other working interest owners. As a result of the reorganization, we now have an improved capital structure and enhanced financial flexibility.
Fresh Start Accounting
The Company elected to apply fresh start accounting effective October 1, 2016, to coincide with the timing of its normal fourth quarter reporting period, which resulted in SandRidge becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. The Company evaluated and concluded that events between October 1, 2016 and October 4, 2016 were immaterial and use of an accounting convenience date of October 1, 2016 was appropriate. As such, fresh start accounting is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and related fresh start adjustments are included in the accompanying statement of operations for the period from January 1, 2016 through October 1, 2016 (the “Predecessor 2016 Period”). 
As a result of the application of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan, the financial statements after October 1, 2016 (the “Successor 2016 Period”) will not be comparable with the financial statements prior to that date. References to the “Successor” or the “Successor Company” relate to SandRidge subsequent to October 1, 2016. References to the “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” refer to SandRidge on and prior to October 1, 2016.

Board of Directors
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the post-emergence board of directors is comprised of five directors, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, James Bennett, and four non-employee directors, Michael L. Bennett, John V. Genova, William “Bill” M. Griffin, Jr. and David J. Kornder.
Presentation of Royalty Trust Activities
Information presented for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes 100% of the interests and activities of the SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (the “Mississippian Trust I”), the SandRidge Permian Trust (the “Permian Trust”) and the SandRidge Mississippian Trust II (the “Mississippian Trust II”) (collectively, the “Royalty Trusts”), including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest. On January 1, 2016, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02, “Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,” which led to the conclusion that the Royalty Trusts were no longer variable interest entities (“VIEs”), and a cumulative-effect adjustment was made to equity to remove the effect of any previously recorded non-controlling interest. Prior periods were not restated. For the 2016 periods, we have proportionately consolidated only our share of each Royalty Trust’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
Post-Emergence Business Strategy
SandRidge’s mission is to create resource value from its oil and natural gas development and production activities in the Mid-Continent and Rockies regions of the United States. In pursuit of its mission, the Company focuses on the following strategies:
Complementary Operating Areas. Our primary areas of operation are the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and Kansas and the Niobrara Shale in the Colorado Rockies. In the Mid-Continent, we are able to (i) leverage technical expertise in the interpretation of geological and operational opportunities, (ii) take advantage of investments in infrastructure including electrical infrastructure and saltwater gathering and disposal systems and (iii) opportunistically grow our holdings through acquisitions, farmouts and operations in this area to achieve production and reserve growth. We are developing a proven oil resource play on our Rockies acreage similar to that being developed by industry in Colorado’s DJ Basin, as both areas draw from the oil rich Niobrara Shale. We will continue to apply our core competencies in developing medium depth formations in the Rockies by deploying our expertise in multi-stage fracture stimulation, artificial lift and extended and multi-lateral horizontal wellbore designs. Additionally, as operator of a majority of our wells, we can further apply competitive advantages to deliver strong, sustainable returns.
Preservation of Capital in Depressed Commodity Pricing Environment. During periods of depressed oil and natural gas pricing, such as that which began during the second half of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and 2016, we have implemented measures to preserve capital and liquidity by decreasing capital expenditures and focusing drilling efforts on locations that make the most effective use of existing infrastructure, and which have a greater certainty of economic returns. We have established a range for our 2017 capital expenditures budget between $210.0 million and $220.0 million, with the substantial majority of the budgeted expenditures being designated for exploration and production activities. 
Focus on Cost Efficiency and Capital Allocation. By leveraging our experienced workforce, scalable operational structure and infrastructure systems, we are able to achieve cost efficiencies and sustainable returns in the Mid-Continent and Rockies areas. In the Mid-Continent, we focus on lower-risk, high rate of return and repeatable drilling opportunities with long economic lives. This has resulted in improved economic returns associated with our multi-lateral wellbore designs, completion designs, well site production facilities, pad drilling utilization, vendor contracts and spud-to-spud cycle time, which reduced our cost structure in the Mid-Continent. Further, due to the relatively low pressure and shallow characteristics of the reservoirs we develop, we are able to maintain a low-cost operating structure and manage service costs. We believe similar opportunities also exist in the Rockies, and have been able to utilize certain technologies and experience from our Mid-Continent operations in the development of our Rockies acreage. The ability to drill multiple laterals or extended laterals from a single pad or single vertical wellbore is facilitating the cost-effective development of this oil rich resource play.
Mitigate Commodity Price Risk. As appropriate, we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of the commodity price volatility inherent in the oil and natural gas industry. This increases the predictability of cash inflows for a portion of future production, lessens funding risks for longer term development plans, and locks in rates of return on our capital projects. 
2

Maintain Flexibility. We have multi-year inventories of both oil and natural gas drilling locations within our core operating areas, which allows management to efficiently direct capital toward projects with the most attractive returns.
Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions. We periodically review acquisition targets to complement our existing asset base. Targets are selectively identified based on several factors including relative value, hydrocarbon mix and location, and the relative fit of our core competencies and technical expertise and, when appropriate, seek to acquire them at a discount to other capital allocation opportunities.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
2016 Divestiture and Release from Treating Agreement
On January 21, 2016, we transferred ownership of substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and midstream assets located in the Piñon field in the West Texas Overthrust (“WTO”) and $11.0 million in cash to a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and were released from all past, current and future claims and obligations under an existing 30-year treating agreement with Occidental. 
The assets of Piñon Gathering Company, LLC (“PGC”), which we acquired in October 2015 as discussed further below, were included in the consideration conveyed to Occidental.
2015 Acquisitions
Piñon Gathering Company, LLC. In October 2015, we acquired the assets of and terminated a gas gathering agreement with PGC for $48.0 million in cash and $78.0 million principal amount of newly issued 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (“PGC Senior Secured Notes”). PGC owned approximately 370 miles of gathering lines supporting the natural gas production from the Company's Piñon field in the WTO.
Rockies Properties - North Park Basin. In December 2015, we acquired approximately 135,000 net acres in the North Park Basin, Jackson County, Colorado for approximately $191.1 million in cash, including post-closing adjustments. Also included in the acquisition were working interests in 16 wells previously drilled on the acreage. Additionally, the seller paid us $3.1 million for certain overriding interests retained in the properties.
2014 Divestiture
Sale of Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast Properties. On February 25, 2014, we sold certain subsidiaries that owned our Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast oil and natural gas properties (collectively, the “Gulf Properties”), to Fieldwood Energy, LLC (“Fieldwood”) for $702.6 million, net of working capital adjustments and post-closing adjustments, and Fieldwood’s assumption of approximately $366.0 million of related asset retirement obligations. We used the proceeds from the sale to fund drilling in the Mid-Continent.

Properties
Mid-Continent
We held interests in approximately 1,185,000 gross (793,000 net) leasehold acres located primarily in Oklahoma and Kansas at December 31, 2016. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 totaled 127.8 MMBoe, 87% of which were proved developed reserves, based on estimates prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., (“CG&A”) and our internal engineers. Our interests in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2016 included 1,972 gross (1,179.5 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 60%. We had one rig operating in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2016, which was drilling a horizontal well. We drilled a total of 16 wells in this area during 2016, all of which were horizontal wells.
Mississippian Formation. The Mississippian formation is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system located on the Anadarko Shelf in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, and is a key target for exploration and development within the Mid-Continent. The top of this formation is encountered between approximately 4,000 and 7,000 feet and lies stratigraphically between various formations of Pennsylvanian age and the Devonian-aged Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippian formation can reach 1,000 feet in gross thickness and have targeted porosity zone(s) ranging between 20 and 150 feet in thickness. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,087,000 gross (736,000 net) acres under lease and 1,471 gross (917.6 net) producing wells in the Mississippian formation. 
Other Formations. The Meramec formation, the primary target in the STACK play of Blaine and Kingfisher Counties, is currently being drilled using horizontal well technology in Garfield, Major, Dewey, and Woodward Counties, a play area called the NW STACK. The formation is Mississippian in age, lying above the Osage formation and below Chester (if present) and Pennsylvanian formations. It is composed of interbedded shales, sands, and carbonates. The top of the formation ranges from about 5,800 feet at the northern edge of the basin to greater than 14,000 feet toward the interior of the basin. The thickness of the formation ranges from about 50 feet to over 400 feet across the STACK and NW STACK area. We drilled two wells in this formation during 2016. Of our total Mississippian acreage at December 31, 2016, approximately 105,500 gross (54,100 net) acres were under lease in the Meramec formation. 
The Osage formation, also a target in the STACK and NW STACK plays, has been targeted both vertically and horizontally across the Anadarko Basin, with the Sooner Trend being a notable historic play. The formation is Mississippian in age, lying above the Woodford formation and below the Meramec and Pennsylvanian formations. It is composed of low porosity, fractured limestone and chert. The top of the formation ranges from 6,000 feet at the northern edge of the basin to about 12,300 feet toward the interior of the basin, with formation thickness ranging from about 450 to 1,400 feet. We drilled one well in this formation during 2016. Of our total Mississippian acreage at December 31, 2016, approximately 13,200 gross (7,600 net) acres were under lease in the Osage formation.

The Woodford Shale is the primary hydrocarbon source for both the Meramec and Osage, while the organic content in the Meramec Shale may provide a self-sourcing component as well. Similar to the STACK, there is an over-pressured area and normally pressured area in the NW STACK. Significant industry activity in the NW STACK has established both the Meramec and Osage as productive reservoirs with successful wells.
Rockies
Our Rockies properties consisted of approximately 140,000 gross (133,000 net) acres, and 25 gross (25.0 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 100%, at December 31, 2016. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were approximately 30.2 MMBoe, of which approximately 12.1% were proved developed reserves. The Rockies acreage is located within the Niobrara Shale play. The Niobrara Shale is characterized by numerous stacked pay reservoirs at depths of 5,500 to 9,000 feet with reservoir thickness over 450 feet. We drilled a total of 10 horizontal producing wells in this area during 2016.
Other properties
Our other oil and natural gas properties include properties in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2016, our other properties consisted of approximately 39,000 gross (24,000 net) leasehold acres, 1,125 gross (1,105.5 net) producing wells with an average working interest of 98%. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 5.9 MMBoe, 100% of which were proved developed reserves. We did not drill any wells in this area during 2016.
Proved Reserves
Preparation of Reserves Estimates
The estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in this report are based on reserve reports, which were largely prepared by independent petroleum engineers. To achieve reasonable certainty, the Company’s reservoir engineers relied on technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used to estimate our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geological maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. This data was reviewed by various levels of management for accuracy, before consultation with independent petroleum engineers. Such consultation included review of properties, assumptions and any new data available. The Corporate Reservoir department’s internal reserves estimates and methodologies were compared to those prepared by independent petroleum engineers to test the reserves estimates and conclusions before the reserves estimates were included in this report. The accuracy of the reserve estimates is dependent on many factors, including the following:

• | the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data;


• | estimates regarding the amount and timing of future costs, which could vary considerably from actual costs;


• | the accuracy of economic assumptions such as the future price of oil and natural gas; and


• | the judgment of the personnel preparing the estimates.

SandRidge’s Senior Vice President—Reserves, Technology and Business Development is the technical professional primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company’s reserves estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering with over 30 years of practical industry experience, including over 30 years of estimating and evaluating reserve information. He has also been a certified professional engineer in the state of Oklahoma since 2007 and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1980.
SandRidge’s reservoir engineers continually monitor well performance, making reserves estimate adjustments, as necessary, to ensure the most current information is reflected in reserves estimates. This information used to prepare reserve estimates includes production histories as well as other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data. The Corporate Reservoir department currently has a total of nine full-time employees, comprised of five degreed engineers and four engineering and business analysts with a minimum of a four-year degree in mathematics, finance or other business or science field. 
5

We encourage ongoing professional education for our engineers and analysts on new technologies and industry advancements as well as refresher training on basic skill sets.
In order to ensure the reliability of reserves estimates, internal controls within the reserve estimation process include

• | the Corporate Reservoir Department follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies to determine and report proved reserves including:


• | confirming that reserves estimates include all properties owned and are based upon proper working and net revenue interests;


• | reviewing and using data provided by other departments within the Company such as Accounting in the estimation process;


• | communicating, collaborating, analytical engineering with technical personnel of our business units;


• | comparing and reconciling the internally generated reserves estimates to those prepared by third parties.


• | reserves estimates are prepared by experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision; and


• | no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves recorded.

Each quarter, the Senior Vice President—Reserves, Technology and Business Development presents the status of the Company’s reserves to a committee of executives, and subsequently obtains approval of all changes from key executives. Additionally, the five year PUD development plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and the Senior Vice President - Reserves, Technology and Business Development.
The Corporate Reservoir Department works closely with its independent petroleum consultants at each fiscal year end to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of annual independent reserves estimates. These independently developed reserves estimates are presented to the Audit Committee. In addition to reviewing the independently developed reserve reports, the Audit Committee also periodically meets with the independent petroleum consultants that prepare estimates of proved reserves.
The percentage of the Company’s total proved reserves prepared by each of the independent petroleum consultants is shown in the table below.

Technologies
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, based on prices used to estimate reserves, from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, natural gas and/or NGLs actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil, natural gas or NGLs on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. In determining the amount of proved reserves, the price used must be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average 
7

of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. See further discussion of prices in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report.
The estimates of proved developed reserves included in the reserve report were prepared using decline curve analysis to determine the reserves of individual producing wells. After estimating the reserves of each proved developed well, it was determined that a reasonable level of certainty exists with respect to the reserves that can be expected from close offset undeveloped wells in the field.
Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids
NGLs are produced as a result of the processing of a portion of our natural gas production stream. At December 31, 2016, NGLs comprised approximately 21% of total proved reserves on a barrel equivalent basis and represented volumes to be produced from properties where we have contracts in place for the extraction and separate sale of NGLs. NGLs are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGLs, we have included production and reserves in barrels. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. All production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing and extraction of NGLs.

Reserve Quantities, PV-10 and Standardized Measure 
The following estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on reserve reports as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the substantial majority of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers. The PV-10 values shown in the table below are not intended to represent the current market value of estimated proved reserves as of the dates shown. The reserve reports were based on the Company’s drilling schedule at the time year end reserve reports were prepared. Reserves for 2016 include our proportionate share of the reserves attributable to the Royalty Trusts while 2015 and 2014 include 100% of the reserves attributable to the Royalty Trusts. Our year end 2016 PUD development plan established that 100% of our current proved undeveloped reserves will be developed by the end of 2021. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent to the reserves estimates.

 | Estimated ProvedReserves(MMBoe) | Standardized Measure(In millions)
December 31, 2015 | 19.1 | | $ | 224.6
December 31, 2014 | 27.6 | | $ | 643.3

See “Note 22—Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding reserve and Standardized Measure amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests. 

(3) | Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs, and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 as Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes. At December 31, 2016, the present value of future income tax discounted at 10% was insignificant due to an excess of tax basis in the full cost pool over projected undiscounted future cash flows.


(4) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using 12-month average prices for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of fair market value of the Company’s oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is used by the industry and by management as a reserve asset value measure to compare against past reserve bases and the reserve bases of other business entities. It is useful because its calculation is not dependent on the taxpaying status of the entity. The following table provides a reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV-10:


 | December 31, 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
 | (In millions)
Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Cash Flows | $ | 438.4 | | | $ | 1,314.6 | | $ | 4,087.8
Present value of future income tax discounted at 10% | — | | | 0.4 | | | 1,428.6
PV-10 | $ | 438.4 | | | $ | 1,315.0 | | $ | 5,516.4

Proved Reserves - Mid-Continent. Proved reserves in the Mid-Continent, primarily the Mississippian formation, decreased from 259.1 MMBoe at December 31, 2015 to 127.8 MMBoe at December 31, 2016. Net of production, the overall decrease of 113.2 MMBoe is primarily due to downward revisions of prior estimates of approximately 106.6 MMBoe, predominantly from revisions of approximately 94.5 MMBoe due to well performance and 12.1 MMBoe due to pricing. The negative revisions from well performance resulted from steeper than anticipated well production decline rates for Mississippian horizontal wells in areas with increased natural fracture density and that have been developed with three or more horizontal wells per section as inter-well pressure communication has had more impact on well performance than originally forecasted. Additionally, changing pressure conditions in the Company’s Mississippian wells producing with artificial lift have resulted in increased production decline rates that are now becoming more predictable on a large group of base wells as this population of wells has been producing for more than two years. Of the total performance revisions, approximately 85% were to gas and associated NGL reserves, with the revisions to gas mostly from changes made to late-life decline rates, and 15% were to oil reserves. The other decrease was 13.0 MMBoe of adjustment due to the proportionate consolidation of the Royalty Trusts’ reserves in 2016 compared to full consolidation in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by 6.5 MMBoe of extensions due to successful drilling.
Proved Reserves - Rockies. Our proved reserves in the Rockies were acquired in December 2015 and increased from 27.6 MMBoe at December 31, 2015 to 30.2 MMBoe at December 31, 2016, primarily due to reserve extensions from horizontal drilling. The acquisition of these reserves in 2015 provided an important proved reserve addition to our asset base. Reservoir characteristics of the Niobrara in the North Park Basin are similar to those of the Niobrara in the DJ Basin to the east of North Park. The Niobrara reservoir consists of multiple stacked benches with the Company’s proved reserves primarily booked to 
10

only one bench. Proved developed reserves were booked based on 25 horizontal producing wells across the play. Production performance and reservoir data gathered from the producing wells confirm consistency in reservoir properties such as porosity, thickness and stratigraphic conformity. These wells encountered proven Niobrara reserves within multiple benches. Using the performance of the proved developing producing wells, proved undeveloped reserves were booked for only one bench of the Niobrara across 27 sections of the proved development area. Although well density in the DJ Basin Niobrara indicates the potential for greater than four wells per section booking, we have only booked up to four wells per section for the Niobrara.
Proved Reserves - Other. In 2016, proved reserves, net of production, decreased by 31.3 MMBoe, primarily due to the divestiture of 24.6 MMBoe of reserves located in the Piñon field in the WTO and a decrease of 6.1 MMBoe due to the proportionate consolidation of the Royalty Trusts’ reserves in 2016 compared to full consolidation in 2015. In 2015, proved reserves decreased by 20.0 MMBoe, primarily due to pricing revisions as a result of significantly lower commodity prices.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. The following table summarizes activity associated with proved undeveloped reserves during the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Reserves converted from proved undeveloped to proved developed (MMBoe) | 6.8 | | | 15.8 | | | 31.4
Drilling capital expended to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves (in millions) | $ | 64.5 | | | $ | 117.7 | | $ | 343.6

Total estimated proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2016 were 43.2 MMBoe, a decrease of 20.9 MMBoe from the prior year, due primarily to downward revisions due to lower prices. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 5.5 MMBoe, 3.2MMBoe in the Mid-Continent as a result of horizontal drilling and 2.3 MMBoe in the Rockies from horizontal wells drilled in the Niobrara Shale. These extensions were offset by 5.2 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 that were converted to proved developed reserves during 2016. Approximately 1.6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were booked and converted during the year 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a decrease in proved undeveloped reserves of 115 MMBoe, primarily due to negative revisions of approximately 147 MMBoe resulting from lower commodity prices. These negative revisions were partially offset by an addition to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with proved undeveloped properties of 48 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 22 MMBoe, primarily from horizontal drilling in the Mississippian formation in the Mid-Continent, which includes 6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves booked and converted during 2015. Acquisition of the Rockies assets, located in Jackson County, Colorado, in December 2015 added 26 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. Approximately 10 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 were converted to proved developed reserves during 2015.
Excluding asset sales, we recognized a net addition to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with proved undeveloped properties of 73 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 67 MMBoe, primarily from horizontal drilling in the Mississippian formation in the Mid-Continent, which includes 10 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves booked and converted during 2014. Net positive revisions of 6 MMBoe were recognized and were comprised of 16 MMBoe in increases from the Mid-Continent primarily from an improved overall Mississippian proved undeveloped type curve, partially offset by negative 10 MMBoe revisions primarily from the removal of Permian Basin proved undeveloped drilling locations not expected to be drilled within a five year period. Approximately 21 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013 were converted to proved developed reserves during 2014.
For additional information regarding changes in proved reserves during each of the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 see “Note 22—Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.

Productive Wells
The following table sets forth the number of productive wells in which the Company owned a working interest at December 31, 2016. We operate substantially all of our wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of producing, including oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities and natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which the Company has a working interest and net wells are the sum of the fractional working interests owned in gross wells.

Drilling Activity
The following table sets forth information with respect to wells completed during the periods indicated. The information presented is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and should not be interpreted to present any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and quantities or economic value of reserves found. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. Gross wells refer to the total number of wells in which the Company had a working interest and net wells are the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells. As of December 31, 2016, we had 2 gross (1.8 net) operated wells drilling, completing or awaiting completion.

The Company had one third-party rig operating on its Mid-Continent acreage, and no other rigs operating on its other acreage as of December 31, 2016. 
Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2016:

 | Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net 
Area | | | | | 
Mid-Continent | 629,965 | | 410,000 | | 555,443 | 383,471

Many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage is established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until production has ceased. As of December 31, 2016, the gross and net acres subject to leases in the undeveloped acreage summarized in the above table are set to expire as follows:

 | Acres Expiring
 | Gross | Net
Twelve Months Ending | | 
December 31, 2017 | 428,349 | | 315,326
December 31, 2018 | 68,783 | | 43,906

Total | 700,134 | | 508,516

____________________

(1) | Leases remaining in effect until development efforts or production on the developed portion of the particular lease has ceased.

The acreage due to expire during the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, includes approximately 369,227 gross (269,130 net) acres in the Mid-Continent area and 48,548 gross (46,099 net) acres in the Rockies area. Of the total 2017 expiring acreage, we anticipate 194,096 gross (130,288 net) acres in the Mid-Continent and 37,925 gross (37,925 net) acres in the Rockies will not be extended or held by production. Approximately 86% of the expiring acreage falls outside of the Company’s core development areas. The core development areas include the NW STACK, the Rockies, and high-graded portions of the Mississippian formation.
Marketing and Customers
We sell our oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of customers, including utilities, oil and natural gas companies and trading and energy marketing companies. We had two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the Successor 2016 Period and the Predecessor 2016 Period. See “Note 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information on our major customers. The number of readily available purchasers for our production makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer in the areas in which we sell our production would materially affect our sales. We do not have any material commitments to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of oil and natural gas in the future under existing sales contracts or sales agreements.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we conduct an initial preliminary review of the title to our properties which do not have proved reserves. Prior to commencing drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. In addition, prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties, may obtain a drilling title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. To date, we have obtained drilling title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have good and defensible title to our producing properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe does not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the carrying value of the properties.
COMPETITION
The Company competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for leases, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. The Company believes that its leasehold acreage position, geographic concentration of operations and technical and operational capabilities enable it to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations. However, the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional discussion of competition in the oil and natural gas industry.
Oil, natural gas and NGLs compete with other forms of energy available to customers, including alternate forms of energy such as electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or other 
15

forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs.
SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of its operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives, can delay the installation of production facilities, and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during certain times of the year, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
General
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge and disposal of materials into the environment, environmental protection, and natural resources. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state and local agencies, (and, in some cases, private individuals) have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require permits to conduct exploration, drilling, water withdrawal and other production activities; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with drilling or production activities, and the manner of any such disposal, release, or injection; (iii) limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; (iv) require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from the Company’s operations or attributable to former operations; (v) impose safety and health restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous or dangerous substances; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas. 

The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in or more stringent enforcement of these laws and regulations that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases, including spills, may occur in the course of our operations, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. While we do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will have an adverse material affect on us, we can provide no assurance that we will not incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the Company.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
We currently own, lease, or operate, and in the past have owned, leased, or operated, properties that have been used in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. We believe we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the applicable time, but hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, and wastes may have been disposed or released on, from or under the properties owned, leased, or operated by the Company or on or under other locations where these substances and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, and wastes 
16

were not under our control. These properties and the substances or wastes disposed on them may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, (“RCRA”), and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances or wastes (including substances or wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to investigate and clean up contaminated property, to perform remedial actions to prevent future contamination, or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred as well as entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible persons” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up sites where the hazardous substances have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources resulting from the release and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies. Additionally, landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and natural resource and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment from a hazardous substance release and to pursue steps to recover costs incurred for those actions from responsible parties. Despite the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” certain products used in the course of our operations may be regulated as CERCLA hazardous substances. To date, no Company-owned or operated site has been designated as a Superfund site, and we have not been identified as a responsible party for any Superfund site.
We also generate wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict “cradle-to-grave” requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, production and/or development of oil and natural gas, including naturally-occurring radioactive material, if properly handled, are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous solid wastes under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste requirements. However, it is possible that these wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any change in the exclusion for such wastes could potentially result in an increase in costs to manage and dispose of wastes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, in the course of our operations, we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are subject to regulation under the RCRA if they have hazardous characteristics.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants through emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to acquire such permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of our oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017. With the EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, certain states may be required to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to our operations and result in the need to install new emissions controls, longer permitting timelines and significant increases in our capital or operating expenditures. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. In June 2016, the EPA also issued final rules that require the reduction of volatile organic compound and methane emissions from additional new, modified or reconstructed oil and natural gas emissions sources. Compliance with these and 
17

other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Water Discharges
The federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws and implementing regulations, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States as well as state waters. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited unless it is permitted by the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers or an analogous state or tribal agency. We do not presently discharge pollutants associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas into federal or state waters. The CWA and analogous state laws and regulations also impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of sediment via storm water run-off to waters of the United States and state waters from a wide variety of construction activities. Such activities are generally prohibited from discharging sediment unless permitted by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The EPA issued a final rule in September 2015 that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as that appellate court and numerous district courts consider lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Also, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works. This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or the CWA include inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems; the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby water bodies; proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The OPA also subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. We have developed and implemented SPCC plans for properties as required under the CWA. 
Subsurface Injections
Underground injection operations performed by us are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although the Company monitors the injection process of its wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Additionally, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water. If such laws are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, our operating costs may increase significantly.
Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical 
18

integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within areas of interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. For example, on February 16, 2016, the OCC issued a plan to reduce disposal well volume in the Arbuckle formation by 40 percent, covering approximately 5,281 square miles and 245 disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. In the plan, the OCC identified 76 SandRidge operated disposals wells, prescribed a four stage volume reduction schedule and set April 30, 2016 as the final date for compliance with the tiered volume reduction plan. On March 7, 2016, the OCC reduced the injection volume of additional Arbuckle disposal wells, including wells we operate. Following earthquakes in August, September and November, the OCC and EPA further limited the disposal volumes that can be disposed in Arbuckle wells, although these recent actions did not cover our disposal wells. 
Additionally, the Governor of Kansas has established a task force composed of various administrative agencies to study and develop an action plan for addressing seismic activity in the state. The task force issued a recommended Seismic Action Plan calling for enhanced seismic monitoring and the development of a seismic response plan, and in November 2014, the Governor of Kansas announced a plan to enhance seismic monitoring in the state. In March 2015, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued its Order Reducing Saltwater Injection Rates. The Order identified five areas of heightened seismic concern in Harper and Sumner Counties and created a timeframe over which the maximum of 8,000 barrels of saltwater injection daily into each well. SandRidge and other operators of injection wells were required to reduce the injection volume, and any injection well drilled deeper than the Arbuckle Formation was required to be plugged back to a shallower formation in a manner approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission. In August 2016, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued an order that put a 16,000 barrels per day limit on additional Arbuckle disposal wells not previously identified in the order released in March 2015. 
Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of saltwater into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where salt water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities , whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could significantly increase our costs to manage and dispose of this saltwater, which could negatively affect the economic lives of the affected properties. In addition, we could find ourselves subject to third party lawsuits alleging damages resulting from seismic events that occur in our areas of operation.

Climate Change
The EPA has published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide (“CO2”), methane and certain other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emission. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically are established by the states. This rule could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay its ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities that exceed GHG emission thresholds. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production and processing facilities on an annual basis, as well as reporting GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, oil well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. The EPA has also adopted regulations that seek to reduce GHG emissions from certain sources. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector. In addition, in November 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas operations on public lands. Future implementation of the BLM rule is uncertain. However, both the EPA and BLM methane rules impose leak detection and repair (“LDAR”) requirements. Compliance with these rules could require us to purchase pollution control equipment, optical gas imaging equipment for LDAR inspections, and to hire additional personnel to assist with inspection and reporting requirements.
In addition, there are a number of state and regional efforts that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that 
19

agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measure each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets, (the “Paris Agreement”). However, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on the United States and future participation in the Paris Agreement is uncertain. The adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, and thus possibly have a material adverse effect on our revenues, as well as having the potential effect of lowering the value of our reserves. Finally, to the extent increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events, such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company and potentially subject the Company to further regulation.
Endangered or Threatened Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. While compliance with the ESA has not had an adverse effect on our exploration, development and production operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist, it may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may delay, restrict or preclude drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. In addition, certain of our federal and state leases may contain stipulations that require us to take measures to safeguard certain species, including the sage grouse, and their habitats known to be located within the area of the lease. If endangered or otherwise protected species are located in areas where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”) is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered under the ESA by the end of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. 
The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 
We are an active participant on various agency and industry committees that are developing or addressing various EPA and other federal and state agency programs to minimize potential impacts to business activity relating to the protection of any endangered or threatened species.
Employee Health and Safety
Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees. Pursuant to the Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, facilities that store threshold amounts of chemicals that are subject to OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard above certain threshold quantities must submit information regarding those chemicals by March 1 of each year to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response. That information is generally available to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and the public. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
State Regulation
The states in which we operate, along with some municipalities and Native American tribal areas, regulate some or all of the following activities: the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including requirements relating to drilling permits, the location, spacing and density of wells, unitization and pooling of interests, the method of drilling, casing and equipping of wells, the protection of fresh water sources, the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil and natural gas, the operation of wells, allowable rates of production, the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations, saltwater injection and disposal operations, the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of 
20

surface properties, the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources, the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and, where necessary to avoid unfair, unjust or discriminatory service, the fees, terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas. These regulations may affect the number and location of our wells and the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, and increase the costs of our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from low permeability subsurface rock formations. Oil and natural gas may be recovered from certain of our oil and natural gas properties through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted federal regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued CAA final regulations in 2012 and additional CAA regulations in June 2016 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; issued in June 2016 final effluent limitations guidelines under the CWA that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a publicly-owned treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016. The ruling is currently on appeal before the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, or that prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the local, state or federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction requirements, increased reporting or plugging and abandoning requirements or operational restrictions, and associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These delays or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable, and could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities.
In addition to asserting regulatory authority, certain government agencies have conducted reviews focusing on environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016. The EPA report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water sources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Since the report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, this years-long study report does not appear to provide any basis for further regulation of hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.
We diligently review best practices and industry standards, serve on industry association committees and comply with all regulatory requirements in the protection of potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface, continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time and disposing of all non-commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources. There have not been any incidents, citations or suits related to our hydraulic fracturing activities involving environmental concerns.

OTHER REGULATION OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local, and regional authorities, as well as Native American tribes. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the Company’s cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability, these burdens generally do not affect the Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
In July 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) released the details of a comprehensive rulemaking proposal to improve the safe transportation of large quantities of flammable materials by rail, particularly crude oil and ethanol. The Federal Railroad Administration and PHMSA jointly published the final rule on May 1, 2015, and it became effective July 7, 2015.  The final rule (i) contains a new enhanced tank car standard and a risk-based retrofitting schedule for older tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol; (ii) requires a new braking standard for certain trains; (iii) designates new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, such as routing requirements, speed restrictions, and information for local government agencies; and (iv) provides new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of energy products placed into transport.

Sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although oil, natural gas and NGL prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas and NGLs might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations.
Drilling and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state, local and Native American tribal levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas where we operate also regulate one or more of the following activities:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities;


• | the rates of production, or “allowables”;


• | the use of surface or subsurface waters;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | the notice to surface owners and other third parties.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce 
22

from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 State agencies in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas impose financial assurance requirements on operators. The United States Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct 2005”), FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our systems have not been regulated by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA, we are required to report aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. In addition, Congress may enact legislation or FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on the Company’s natural gas related activities.
Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in-state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, in the past FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our cost of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
EMPLOYEES
We completed reductions in force during the first and fourth quarters of 2016, and as of December 31, 2016, had 509 full-time employees, including 110 geologists, geophysicists, petroleum engineers, technicians, land and regulatory professionals. Of our 509 employees, 278 were located at the Company’s headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at December 31, 2016, and the remaining employees worked in our various field offices and drilling sites.
GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS
The following is a description of the meanings of certain oil and natural gas industry terms used in this report.
2-D seismic or 3-D seismic. Geophysical data that depict the subsurface strata in two dimensions or three dimensions, respectively. 3-D seismic typically provides a more detailed and accurate interpretation of the subsurface strata than 2-D seismic.
Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this report in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
23

Bcf. Billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Bench. A geological horizon; a thin, distinctive stratum useful for stratigraphic correlation. 
Boe. Barrels of oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one barrel of oil. Although an equivalent barrel of condensate or natural gas may be equivalent to a barrel of oil on an energy basis, it is not equivalent on a value basis as there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent barrel and a barrel of oil. For example, based on the commodity prices used to prepare the estimate of the Company’s reserves at year-end 2016 of $39.25/Bbl for oil and $2.48/Mcf for natural gas, the ratio of economic value of oil to gas was approximately 16 to 1, even though the ratio for determining energy equivalency is 6 to 1.
Boe/d. Boe per day.
Btu or British thermal unit. The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
Completion. The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry well, the reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
CO2. Carbon dioxide.
Developed acreage. The number of acres that are assignable to productive wells.
Developed oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and natural gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to (i) gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building and relocating public roads, gas lines and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves, (ii) drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly, (iii) acquire, construct and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems, and (iv) provide improved recovery systems.
Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
Dry well. An exploratory, development or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
Environmental Assessment (“EA”). A study to determine whether an action significantly affects the environment, which federal or state agencies may be required by the National Environmental Policy Act or similar state statutes to undertake prior to the commencement of activities that would constitute federal or state actions, such as permitting oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.
Exploratory well. A well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to produce oil or natural gas in another reservoir.
Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geological barriers, or both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms “structural feature” and “stratigraphic condition” are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas of interest, etc.
Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned.
24

MBbls. Thousand barrels of oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
MBoe. Thousand barrels of oil equivalent.
Mcf. Thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
MMBbls. Million barrels of oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
MMBoe. Million barrels of oil equivalent.
MMBtu. Million British Thermal Units.
MMcf. Million cubic feet of natural gas.
MMcf/d. MMcf per day.
Net acres or net wells. The sum of the fractional working interest owned in gross acres or gross wells, as the case may be.
NGL. Natural gas liquids, such as ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline that are extracted from natural gas production streams.
NYMEX. The New York Mercantile Exchange.
Plugging and abandonment. Refers to the sealing off of fluids in the strata penetrated by a well so that the fluids from one stratum will not escape into another or to the surface. Regulations of all states require plugging of abandoned wells.
Present value of future net revenues. The present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, before income taxes, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation and without giving effect to hedging activities, non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization. PV-10 is calculated using an annual discount rate of 10% and PV-9 is calculated using an annual discount rate of 9%.
Production costs. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities, that become part of the cost of oil and natural gas produced.
Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
Prospect. A specific geographic area that, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is deemed to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons.
Proved developed reserves. Reserves that are both proved and developed.
Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Has the meaning given to such term in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X, which defines proved reserves as:
Those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
25

Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Proved undeveloped reserves. Reserves that are both proved and undeveloped.
PV-9. See “Present value of future net revenues” above.
PV-10. See “Present value of future net revenues” above.
Reserves. Estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
Standardized measure or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 because Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues.
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
Undeveloped oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.

(i) | Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.


(ii) | Undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.


(iii) | Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

26

Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
