ITEM 1.BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Company Overview
Just Energy is a retail energy provider specializing in electricity and natural gas commodities and bringing energy efficient solutions and renewable energy options to customers. Currently operating in the United States and Canada, Just Energy serves retail and commercial customers through its two business segments - Mass Market and Commercial. Just Energy is the parent company of Amigo Energy, Filter Group, Hudson Energy, Interactive Energy Group, Tara Energy and Terrapass.
COMPANIES’ CREDITIORS ARRANGEMENT AND CHAPTER 15 PROCEEDINGS
In February 2021, the State of Texas experienced the Weather Event. The Weather Event led to increased electricity demand and sustained high prices from February 13, 2021 through February 20, 2021. As a result of the losses sustained and without sufficient liquidity to pay the corresponding invoices from the ERCOT when due, and accordingly, on March 9, 2021, Just Energy applied for and received Court Orders under the CCAA from the Ontario Court and under Chapter 15 in the U.S. from the Houston Court. Protection under the Court Orders allows Just Energy to operate while it restructures its capital structure.

As part of the CCAA filing, the Company entered into a $125.0 million DIP Facility financing with certain affiliates of PIMCO (refer to Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 16(a) and Note 26). The Company also entered into qualifying support agreements with its largest commodity supplier and ISO services provider. The filings and associated DIP Facility arranged by the Company, enabled Just Energy to continue all operations without interruption throughout the U.S. and Canada and to continue making payments required by ERCOT and satisfy other regulatory obligations.
On September 15, 2021, the Ontario Court approved the Company’s request to establish a claims process to identify and determine claims against the Company and its subsidiaries that are subject to the ongoing Claims Procedure Order. As part of the CCAA proceedings and in accordance with the Claims Procedure Order, Just Energy continues to review and determine which claims will be allowed, modified or disallowed, which may result in additional liabilities subject to compromise that are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements (refer to Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 25(d) Commitments and Contingencies).
Plan Support Agreement
As previously disclosed, in connection with the CCAA filing, on May 12, 2022, the Company, the Stalking Horse Purchaser and certain other parties thereto, entered into a plan support agreement (the “Plan Support Agreement”). Upon the execution of the SISP Support Agreement (defined below), the Plan Support Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder were automatically terminated pursuant to its terms.
The Plan Support Agreement contemplated the implementation of a recapitalization and financial restructuring of the Just Energy Entities through: (i) a reorganization of the Just Energy Entities, (ii) a rights offering for the issuance of approximately $192.5 million of new common equity which would be backstopped by the Stalking Horse Purchaser pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Letter, (iii) the issuance of new preferred equity, which would be owned entirely by the Stalking Horse Purchaser, and new common equity, (iv) the cancellation for no consideration of all outstanding shares of the Company and (v) the entry into the new credit agreement and the new intercreditor agreement.
The Plan Support Agreement contained certain covenants on the part of the parties thereto, as well as certain conditions to the obligations of such parties and for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve certain milestones and certain breaches by the parties under the Plan Support Agreement.
Backstop Commitment Letter

1



Also, as previously disclosed, in connection with the Plan Support Agreement, on May 12, 2022, the Stalking Horse Purchaser entered into a Backstop Commitment Letter (the “Backstop Commitment Letter”) with Just Energy (U.S.) Corp., pursuant to which the Stalking Horse Purchaser (the “Backstop Parties”) agreed to backstop the approximately $192.5 million rights offering contemplated by the Plan Support Agreement. Upon the execution of the SISP Support Agreement (defined below), the Backstop Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereunder were automatically terminated pursuant to its terms.
Under the Backstop Commitment Letter, the Backstop Parties agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Backstop Commitment Letter, to (i) purchase new common equity of the new parent company of the Just Energy Entities, (ii) subscribe for and receive its pro rata share of any unsubscribed new common equity in the rights offering and (iii) subscribe for and receive its pro rata share of new common equity in the rights offering upon the failure by another participant to fulfill its subscription obligations by the participation deadline. The issuance of the new common equity under the rights offering will represent in the aggregate 80% of the new common equity of the new parent company of the Just Energy Entities.
Under the Backstop Commitment Letter, Just Energy (U.S.) Corp. agreed to issue and deliver 10% of the outstanding new common shares on the effective date, which would have constituted backstop commitment fee shares. In addition, Just Energy (U.S.) Corp. agreed to pay a termination fee of $15 million to the Backstop Parties if the Plan Support Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Backstop Commitment Letter, the term loan lenders of the Just Energy Entities were entitled to participate in the rights offering as backstop parties for their pro rata shares of new common equity. The Backstop Parties’ commitments to backstop the rights offering and the other transactions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter were conditioned upon the satisfaction of all applicable conditions set forth in the Backstop Commitment Letter.
PROPOSED SALE AND INVESTMENT SOLICITATION PROCESS AND STALKING HORSE TRANSACTION
On August 4, 2022, the Company entered into a stalking horse transaction agreement (the “Stalking Horse Transaction Agreement”) with the Stalking Horse Purchaser and a support agreement (the “SISP Support Agreement”) in connection with the SISP that is intended to facilitate its exit from the Company’s ongoing insolvency proceedings as a going concern.
Under the SISP, interested parties are invited to participate in accordance with the approved SISP procedures. If one or more qualified bids (other than the transaction contemplated by the Stalking Horse Transaction) are received by September 29, 2022, then Just Energy intends to proceed with an auction to determine the successful bid(s), subject to the terms of the approved SISP procedures. If the Stalking Horse Purchaser is determined to be the successful bidder at the conclusion of the SISP and is subsequently approved by the Court, the Stalking Horse Purchaser will become the sole shareholder of Just Energy (U.S.) Corp., which will be the new parent company of all of the Just Energy Entities, including the Company, and the Just Energy Entities will continue their business and operations as a going concern.
The SISP Support Agreement further contemplates the entry into the Stalking Horse Transaction pursuant to the Stalking Horse Transaction Agreement, under which, among other things, (A) the Stalking Horse Purchaser agreed to act as a “stalking horse” bidder with respect to the SISP, (B) the existing common shares and all other equity interests of the Company would be cancelled or redeemed for no consideration, (C) the issuance of new common equity and new preferred equity of the new parent company of the Just Energy Entities, which will be owned entirely by certain affiliates of the Stalking Horse Purchaser, and (v) the entry into a new credit agreement and a new intercreditor agreement on the terms set forth in the term sheets appended to the SISP Support Agreement.
The SISP Support Agreement contains certain covenants on the part of the parties thereto, as well as certain termination rights upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, (i) the failure to achieve certain milestones and certain breaches by the parties under the SISP Support Agreement and (ii) the Stalking Horse Purchaser not being the successful bidder under the SISP procedures. Additionally, upon the execution of the SISP Support Agreement, each of the Plan Support Agreement, the Backstop Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereunder were automatically terminated.

Discontinued Operations
In March 2019, Just Energy formally approved and commenced the process to dispose of its businesses in Germany, Ireland and Japan. In June 2019, the U.K. was added to the disposal group. The decision was part of a strategic transition to focus on the core business in North America. In November 2019, Just Energy closed the sale of Hudson U.K. to Shell Energy Retail Limited and completed the sale of its business in Ireland in February 2020. In April 2020, the Company sold all of the shares of Just Energy Japan to Astmax Trading, Inc. These operations were reclassified and reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 24 Discontinued Operations).
Continuing operations overview
MASS MARKETS SEGMENT
The Mass Markets segment includes customers acquired and served under the Just Energy, Tara Energy, Amigo Energy and Terrapass brands. Marketing of the energy products of this segment is primarily done through the digital and retail sales channels. Mass Market customers make up 73% of Just Energy’s Base Gross Margin, which is currently focused on price–protected and flat–bill product offerings, as well as JustGreen products. To the extent that certain markets are better served by shorter–term or enhanced variable rate products, the Mass Markets segment’s sales channels offer these products.
Just Energy also provides home water filtration systems with its line of consumer product and service offerings through Filter Group.
COMMERCIAL SEGMENT
The Commercial segment includes customers acquired and served under Hudson Energy, as well as brokerage services managed by Interactive Energy Group. Hudson Energy sales are made through three main channels: brokers, in-person commercial independent contractors and inside commercial sales representatives. Commercial customers make up 27% of Just Energy’s Base Gross Margin. Products offered to Commercial customers range from standard fixed–price offerings to “one off” offerings, tailored to meet the customer’s specific needs. These products can be fixed or floating rate or a blend of the two, and normally have a term of less than five years. Base Gross Margin per RCE for this segment is lower than it is for the Mass Markets segment, but customer acquisition costs and ongoing customer care costs per RCE are lower as well. Commercial customers also have significantly lower attrition rates than Mass Markets customers.
ABOUT JUST ENERGY’S PRODUCTS
Just Energy offers products and services to address customers’ essential needs, including electricity and natural gas commodities, energy efficient solutions, carbon offsets and renewable energy options as well as water quality and filtration devices.

Electricity
Just Energy services various states and territories in the U.S. and Canada with electricity. A variety of electricity solutions are offered, including fixed–price, flat–bill and variable–price products on both short–term and longer–term contracts. Most of these products provide customers with price–protection programs for the majority of their electricity requirements. Just Energy uses historical usage data for enrolled customers to predict future customer consumption and to help with long–term supply procurement decisions. Flat–bill products offer customers the ability to pay a fixed amount per period regardless of usage.
Just Energy purchases electricity supply from market counterparties for Mass Markets and Commercial customers based on forecasted customer aggregation. Electricity supply is generally purchased concurrently with the execution of a contract for larger Commercial customers. Historical customer usage is obtained from LDCs, which, when normalized to average weather, provides Just Energy with expected normal customer consumption. Just Energy mitigates exposure to weather variations through active management of the electricity portfolio and the purchase of options, including weather derivatives. Just Energy’s ability to successfully mitigate weather effects is limited by the degree to which weather conditions deviate from normal and the availability and costs of such options. To the extent that balancing electricity requirements are outside the forecasted purchase, Just Energy bears the financial responsibility for excess or short supply caused by fluctuations in customer usage. Any supply balancing not fully covered through customer pass–throughs, active management or the options employed may increase or decrease Just Energy’s Base Gross Margin depending upon market conditions at the time of balancing.
Natural gas
Just Energy offers natural gas customers a variety of products ranging from five–year fixed–price contracts to month–to–month variable–price contracts. Gas supply is purchased from market counterparties based on forecasted consumption. For larger Commercial customers, gas supply is generally purchased concurrently with the execution of a contract. Variable rate products allow customers to maintain flexibility while retaining the ability to lock into a fixed price at their discretion. Flat–bill products offer customers the ability to pay a fixed amount per period regardless of usage or changes in the price of the commodity.
The LDCs provide historical customer usage which, when normalized to average weather, enables Just Energy to purchase the expected normal customer consumption. Just Energy mitigates exposure to weather variations through active management of the gas portfolio, which involves, but is not limited to, the purchase of options, including weather derivatives. Just Energy’s ability to successfully mitigate weather effects is limited by the degree to which weather conditions deviate from normal and the availability and costs of such options. To the extent that balancing requirements are outside the forecasted purchase, Just Energy bears the financial responsibility for fluctuations in customer usage. To the extent that supply balancing is not fully covered through active management or the options employed, Just Energy’s Base Gross Margin may increase or decrease depending upon market conditions at the time of balancing.
JustGreen
Many customers have the ability to choose an appropriate JustGreen program to supplement their electricity and natural gas, providing an effective method to offset their carbon footprint associated with the respective commodity consumption.
JustGreen’s electricity products offer customers the option of having all or a portion of the volume of their electricity usage sourced from renewable green sources such as wind, solar, hydropower or biomass, via power purchase agreements and renewable energy certificates. JustGreen programs for gas customers involve the purchase of carbon offsets from carbon capture and reduction projects. Additional green products allow customers to offset their carbon footprint without buying energy commodity products and can be offered in all states and provinces without being dependent on energy deregulation.
Just Energy currently sells JustGreen electricity and gas in eligible markets across North America. Of all customers who contracted with Just Energy in the past year, 40% purchased JustGreen for some or all of their energy needs. On average, these customers elected to purchase 93% of their consumption as green supply. For comparison, as reported for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021, 37% of mass market customers who contracted with Just Energy chose to include JustGreen for an average of 98% of their consumption. As at March 31, 2022, JustGreen makes up 24% of the Mass Market

electricity portfolio, compared to 25% in the year ago period. JustGreen makes up 24% of the Mass Market gas portfolio, compared to 17% in the year ago period.
Terrapass
Through Terrapass, customers can offset their environmental impact by purchasing high quality environmental products. Terrapass supports projects throughout North America and world–wide that destroy greenhouse gases, produce renewable energy and restore freshwater ecosystems. Each project is made possible through the purchase of carbon offsets, renewable energy credits and BEF Water Restoration Certificates®. Terrapass offers various purchase options for Mass Markets or Commercial customers, enabling businesses to incorporate seamless carbon offset options by providing marketing and product integration solutions.
Seasonality
The sale of electricity to retail customers is a seasonal business with the demand for electricity generally peaking during the summer months. Conversely, the sale of natural gas to retail customers is also a seasonal business with demand for natural gas generally peaking during the winter months. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power and natural gas prices and market dynamics, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates.
Employee Overview
As of March 31, 2022, Just Energy had 1,177 employees in the U.S., Canada and India, including a total of 1,125 full time employees. 
​
Governmental Regulation
​
Just Energy’s business is subject to extensive Canadian and U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign and provincial laws. Retail energy competition is regulated on a state-by-state or at the province-by-province level and is highly dependent on state and provincial laws, regulations and policies, which could change at any moment. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the loss of license, exit from the market, shutdown, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.
The regulatory environment has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state, provincial and federal policies affecting wholesale and retail competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation. For example, changes to, or development of, legislation that requires the use of clean renewable and alternate fuel sources or mandate the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, could increase the Company’s cost to serve and/or impact the Company’s financial condition. Additionally, in some retail energy markets, state legislators, government agencies and other interested parties have made proposals to change the use of market-based pricing, re-regulate areas of these markets that have previously been competitive, or permit electricity delivery companies to construct or acquire generating facilities. Other proposals to re-regulate the retail energy industry may be made, and legislative or other actions affecting electricity and natural gas deregulation or restructuring process may be delayed, discontinued or reversed in states in which we currently operate or may in the future operate.
Health and Safety
​
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our top priorities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working to keep our employees safe and healthy from this outbreak. Using guidance from the Center for Disease Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization, and the various states, provinces and counties in which we operate, we have taken a number of measures to keep employees safe. Employees are provided paid sick leave or paid time off to cover sickness and absences. We will continue to make our employees a priority.
