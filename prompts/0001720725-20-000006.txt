ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class pharmaceutical therapies to treat ocular surface diseases. Our lead product candidate OC-01 (varenicline), a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, is being developed as a nasal spray to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease (DED). OC-01’s novel mechanism of action is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis by activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway and stimulating the glands and cells responsible for natural tear film production. In our Phase 2b clinical trial (ONSET-1) in 182 subjects, OC-01 demonstrated statistically significant improvements (as compared to placebo) in both signs and symptoms of DED in a single registrational clinical trial. Based on OC-01’s clinical trial results and its rapid onset of action, we believe OC-01, if approved, has the potential to become the new standard of care and redefine how DED is treated for millions of patients. We initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial (ONSET-2) in July 2019 and expect to report top-line results by the end of the second quarter 2020. Based on the results from this second registrational trial, we plan to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2020. We believe that targeting the parasympathetic nervous system through the use of locally administered cholinergic agonists has the potential to treat a wide range of diseases and disorders. We have identified several indications, including several outside of ophthalmology, where we believe this approach could provide a meaningful benefit to patients.
DED is a multifactorial chronic disease of the ocular surface characterized by the loss of tear film homeostasis, resulting in pain, visual impairment, tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, inflammation, and corneal wounding. More than 340 million adults globally and approximately 34 million adults in the United States are estimated to suffer from DED. In the United States, DED is most commonly treated with a variety of over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and three FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis, Xiidra and Cequa. Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability, but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis and Cequa, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra, a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist, address chronic inflammation associated with DED. Despite the commercial uptake of these therapies—as examples, Restasis, marketed by Allergan, and Xiidra, recently acquired by Novartis, had U.S. sales in 2018 of $1.2 billion and $383 million, respectively—respondents in a survey we commissioned in June 2017 of 150 board-certified or board-eligible eye care practitioners (ECPs) were generally “neutral” or “completely disagreed” with the statement that they could, in their opinion, successfully treat all DED patients with the currently available treatment options whereas only 10% “completely agreed” with such statement. We estimate that of the approximately seven million patients who have started a prescription treatment to date, fewer than two million remain on prescription at any given time due to the significant limitations of these therapies, which include:

• | Mechanisms of action only address inflammation. Currently approved therapies only target inflammation for moderate to severe DED; no approved pharmaceutical products replicate natural tear film, which is highly complex in composition. As these prescription therapies fail to address the fundamental characteristic of DED, the loss of tear film homeostasis, we estimate that 75% of patients still require over-the-counter therapies to supplement their treatment.


• | Slow onset of action. Based on data reported from clinical trials, currently available treatments can take between three to six months to demonstrate a significant effect in clinical signs. We believe this delayed onset of action hinders compliance and in turn limits the benefit that patients derive from such treatments.


• | Tolerability and compliance issues. Currently approved pharmaceutical therapies for DED are typically administered in an eye-drop formulation and are commonly associated with ocular burning, reduced visual acuity and bad taste after application. The effective use of eye drops can be challenging for some patients, and such challenges can result in reduced compliance.

To address these limitations and the high unmet need expressed by patients, ECPs and payors, we are developing a product candidate that we believe has the potential to become the new standard of care for DED. However, there is no guarantee that such product candidate will be approved by the FDA or, if approved, will provide revenues comparable to Restasis or Xiidra.
Our novel approach leverages the parasympathetic nervous system to promote natural tear film production and re-establish tear film homeostasis. Human tear film is a complex mixture of more than 1,500 different proteins, including antibodies, and numerous classes of lipids and mucins that are responsible for forming the primary refracting surface of the cornea, as well as protecting and moisturizing the cornea. The Lacrimal Functional Unit (LFU), which is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous 
system, is comprised of glands and cells responsible for producing the three layers that comprise healthy tear film. To stimulate the LFU, we are targeting a class of receptors called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) that are located on the trigeminal nerve and readily accessible within the anterior nasal cavity. Administered as a preservative-free, aqueous nasal spray, OC-01’s novel mechanism of action activates the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway to promote natural tear film production. We believe that increasing tear film volume and re-establishing tear film homeostasis will address the fundamental characteristic of DED, regardless of etiology, and has the potential to treat a broad population of patients throughout the dry eye continuum.
To date, we have treated over 500 subjects across five trials with OC-01 and OC-02 (simpinicline, which was formerly called simpanicline), our second nAChR agonist product candidate. We have consistently designed our clinical trials to be placebo (vehicle)-controlled, statistically rigorous and evaluated using pre-specified sign and symptom endpoints. In October 2018, we reported results from ONSET-1, a dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, registrational Phase 2b clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 in 182 subjects with DED in the United States. The study compared three different doses of OC-01 to placebo. The pre-specified primary (sign) endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by Schirmer’s Score at Week 4 and the two pre-specified secondary (symptom) endpoints were patient-reported symptoms of DED as measured by Eye Dryness Score (EDS) at Weeks 3 and 4. These endpoints are consistent with those that have been previously utilized in clinical trials of FDA-approved products for DED. Results showed statistically significant improvements of the primary endpoint (Schirmer’s Score) at all doses compared to placebo. In addition, results showed statistically significant improvements of the secondary endpoint (EDS) at Week 3 in the 0.6 mg/ml (p=0.006) and 1.2 mg/ml (*p<0.001) dose groups and at Week 4 in the 0.6 mg/ml (p=0.021) dose group. Moreover, OC-01 is designed to promote rapid production of tear film, and improvements in signs and symptoms were observed as quickly as five minutes after administration. OC-01 was well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study with no serious drug-related adverse events reported.
We met with the FDA in February 2019 for an end of Phase 2 meeting following the completion of ONSET-1, and the FDA indicated ONSET-1 could serve as one of the two pivotal safety and efficacy studies required to support an NDA filing for OC-01. Based on this feedback we initiated ONSET-2, a 750-subject, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, in July 2019. Assuming the effect size seen in ONSET-1, and based on this sample size, the power for each dose group for both sign and symptom endpoints would be 99% or greater. We expect to report top-line results from this second registrational trial by the end of the second quarter 2020 and, if successful, submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2020. 
We also completed a comparative pharmacokinetic “bridge” trial (ZEN) to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally (Chantix). The FDA has indicated that reliance upon the varenicline tartrate data in our 505(b)(2) NDA submission would be considered scientifically justified if exposure levels following nasal spray administration of our final clinical formulation are less than or equal to that of Chantix at its approved dose and route of administration. We reported positive top-line results in November 2019 illustrating that the exposure levels following nasal spray administration are significantly lower than those seen with oral varenicline.
Leveraging our nAChR domain expertise, we continue to explore the development of OC-01 for a number of potential indications and uses associated with and beyond DED, including neurotrophic keratitis, dry eye associated with contact lens intolerance and ocular surface treatment for refractive surgeries. We have also studied OC-02 in two Phase 2b clinical trials in subjects with DED. However, we do not currently intend to pursue FDA approval for OC-02 in DED. We believe that targeting the parasympathetic nervous system through the use of locally administered cholinergic agonists has the potential to treat a wide range of diseases and disorders in the eye and systemically.
To execute on our vision to develop and commercialize a new standard of care for DED, we have assembled a team with extensive experience developing and commercializing leading ophthalmic products and therapies. Members of our management team have held senior positions at Allergan, Eyetech, Genentech, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Oculeve, Ophthotech, Pfizer, Pharmasset, and Shire. We intend to leverage this expertise and experience to rapidly pursue the development of OC-01, OC-02 and any other future product candidates that we may identify and develop. We also have leading financial investors which include New Enterprise Associates, Versant Ventures, Invus Opportunities, Flying L Ventures (investing through its Oyster Point Pharma I fund), KKR (investing through its Falcon Vision fund) and Vida Ventures.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to transform the treatment of DED and other ocular surface diseases by developing a broad portfolio of innovative therapies that target significant unmet medical needs. We intend to achieve this goal by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:

• | Completing development and obtaining approval of OC-01 for the treatment of DED. OC-01 demonstrated statistically significant improvements (as compared to placebo) in both signs and symptoms of DED in a single registrational clinical trial. We are not aware of another therapy that has shown statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of DED in a single registrational clinical trial. However, to date our trials have been designed as randomized, masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials and, as such, we have not tested OC-01 head-to-head with any other products or therapies, nor are we aware of any head-to-head results indicating that such other products or therapies could not have shown similar results. Based on the strength of the data observed in ONSET-1, our Phase 2b registrational clinical trial, we initiated a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ONSET-2). We expect to report top-line results from this second registrational trial by the end of the second quarter 2020 and, if successful, submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2020.
• | Establishing our own specialty sales organization to commercialize OC-01 in the United States. If OC-01 is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of DED, we intend to commercialize our lead product candidate by deploying a specialty sales force at launch of approximately 150 to 200 field representatives targeting the top-prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating patients with DED, we also anticipate deploying focused direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for OC-01. We anticipate that this sales organization could also support the commercialization of additional product candidates treating ocular diseases. 


• | Maximizing the value of OC-01 and our other product candidates outside the United States. With more than 300 million additional DED patients outside of the United States, we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for our product candidates internationally. To address these markets, we may seek one or more partners with regional capabilities and infrastructure to support and potentially accelerate the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, in such geographies.


• | Developing OC-01 for additional indications associated with and beyond DED. Based on the fundamental role of natural tear film in ocular surface health, we plan to pursue development of OC-01 in other indications where this equilibrium is disturbed. First, we plan to pursue development for patients with neurotrophic keratitis, a degenerative disease resulting from a loss of corneal sensation, which causes progressive damage to the top layer of the cornea. As natural tear film contains a myriad of beneficial components, including endogenous growth factors, proteins and antibodies, we believe that our product candidate could be beneficial in improving the health of the cornea in these patients. A second population of potential clinical benefit is in subjects with DED associated with contact lens intolerance. In addition, based on the unique characteristics of this product candidate, we see the potential for use in patients that are preparing for refractive surgery where there is often an underlying dry eye condition that could impact refraction and ultimately patient satisfaction and quality of life post-surgery.
• | Leveraging the capabilities of our experienced discovery and development team and our nAChR domain expertise to continue expanding our pipeline of product candidates. We have studied a second nAChR agonist product candidate OC-02 (simpinicline) in two Phase 2b clinical trials for DED. We have identified several indications, other than DED, where we believe this product candidate has the potential to provide a meaningful benefit to patients. In certain indications, we believe OC-02 could advance directly into a Phase 2 proof of concept study, supported by preclinical and clinical data that we and others have generated. However, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will permit us to advance OC-02 into a Phase 2 proof of concept study nor can we guarantee that the FDA will grant marketing approval to OC-02 for the treatment of any indication. Beyond OC-02, we plan to continue our efforts to identify and develop additional product candidates. 


• | Selectively evaluating external opportunities to expand the scope of our pipeline or product offerings. We may pursue acquisition or in-licensing of product candidates, particularly in our core disease area of ocular surface diseases.

Dry Eye Disease Overview
Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial, age-related chronic progressive disease of the ocular surface resulting in pain, visual impairment, tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, and inflammation. Patients with DED are also more susceptible to eye infections and damage to the surface of the eye (cornea). DED is characterized by a reduction in tear volume, rapid breakup of the tear film, or an increase in the evaporative properties of the tear film layer. DED affects daily life, including reading and 
driving at night and has been associated with depression and migraines. DED can also limit patients’ ability to tolerate contact lenses and impacts patient satisfaction with post-op cataract and refractive patients.
As illustrated below, the Lacrimal Functional Unit (LFU), which is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, is comprised of Meibomian glands, lacrimal glands, and goblet cells that are responsible for producing the three layers that comprise healthy tear film. The National Eye Institute defines healthy tear film as “a complex mixture of fatty oils, water, mucus, and more than 1,500 different proteins that keep the surface of the eye smooth and protected from the environment, irritants, and infectious pathogens.” The outermost layer of tear film is a lipid layer produced by the Meibomian glands that keeps tear film from evaporating too quickly. The lacrimal glands produce the aqueous layer, which comprises the bulk of tear volume and flow. This middle layer is not just water – it contains thousands of proteins, enzymes, antibodies and growth factors that are cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial. The aqueous layer nourishes the cornea and the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane that covers the entire front of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. Finally, the innermost mucin layer is produced by goblet cells and binds water from the aqueous layer to ensure that the eye remains wet. The LFU receives stimulus from the trigeminal nerve, which has sensory nerve endings in the nasal cavity.
LFU dysfunction leads to the loss of tear film homeostasis and can ultimately lead to the cycle of chronic DED. Disruption and instability of the tear film results in irritation, inflammation, and ultimately cellular damage. Chronic symptoms of DED include a scratchy sensation (foreign body sensation), stinging or burning, episodes of excess tearing that follow periods of dryness, discharge, pain, and redness in the eye. In addition, patients with dry eye often experience blurred vision as the cornea and the tear film are responsible for 65%-75% of the eye’s focusing power. Approved prescription treatments for DED, as well as therapies in clinical development, target inflammation further down the DED continuum. We believe these therapies only treat patients with moderate to severe DED and do not address the loss of tear film homeostasis, the fundamental characteristic of DED. Our lead product candidate OC-01 is designed to stimulate the LFU to produce natural tear film, re-establish tear film homeostasis and improve the signs and symptoms of patients with DED.
Market opportunity in DED
DED is highly prevalent and growing, currently affecting more than 340 million people globally. In the United States, DED affects an estimated 14.5% of the adult population, or 34 million adults, resulting in greater than $55 billion in annual indirect costs, such as reductions in productivity. Prevalence of DED continues to grow due to an aging population, increase in autoimmune diseases, contact lens wear and digital screen time. Although DED is one of the most common reasons people visit an ECP in the United States, it is estimated that only 16 million adults have been diagnosed with DED by an ECP, which we believe is due in part to lack of education and insufficient awareness on the part of the patient.
Despite the number of patients diagnosed with DED, we estimate that only seven million patients to date have started a prescription treatment regimen which we believe is based at least in part on a lack of treatment options that are suitable for chronic use. In a survey we commissioned in June 2017 (the ECP Survey) of eye care practitioners (ECPs), respondents were generally neutral or dissatisfied with their treatment options for patients with DED. The ECP Survey was conducted by means of a distributed questionnaire to 150 respondent ECPs who specialize primarily in ophthalmology or optometry, are board-certified or board-eligible, manage at least 40 unique patients per month with DED and are familiar with, or prescribe, currently available prescription therapies. In the ECP Survey, we asked ECPs to select whether they completely disagreed, were neutral or completely agreed with the statement that they “can successfully treat all Dry Eye patients with currently available options.” Approximately 40% of ECPs responded that they completely disagreed with the statement, approximately 50% responded that they were neutral and only 10% responded that they completely agreed. Similarly, the top clinical reasons patients discontinued therapy were insufficient symptom improvement, side effects, and delayed onset of action. Medication cost was also a factor in discontinuing therapy. However, in our survey of patients who had discontinued Restasis due to costs, 72% stated they would have been willing to pay the same price if the medication had worked better. As a result of these factors, we believe that only two million patients are on a prescription therapy at any given time. Despite the small percentage of DED patients on prescription therapy, Restasis (marketed by Allergan) and Xiidra (recently acquired by Novartis for a total consideration of up to $5.3 billion) had U.S. sales in 2018 of $1.2 billion and $383 million, respectively. However, we cannot guarantee that OC-01 or any of our other future product candidates will be approved by the FDA and, even if one of our product candidates is approved, there is no guarantee that our revenues will be comparable to those of Restasis or Xiidra.
Current treatment options and their limitations
DED is primarily treated with a variety of over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and three FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis, Xiidra and Cequa. Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability, but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis and Cequa, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra, a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist, which has been approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of DED, address chronic inflammation associated with DED. Other treatment options include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. Unfortunately, all currently approved treatment options for DED have significant limitations, which include:

• | Mechanisms of action only address inflammation. Currently approved therapies only target inflammation for moderate to severe DED; no approved pharmaceutical products replicate natural tear film, which is highly complex in composition. As these prescription therapies fail to address the fundamental characteristic of DED, the loss of tear film homeostasis, we estimate that 75% of patients still require over-the-counter therapies to supplement their treatment.


• | Slow onset of action. Based on data reported from clinical trials, currently available treatments can take between three to six months to demonstrate a significant effect in clinical signs. We believe this delayed onset of action hinders compliance and in turn limits the benefit that patients derive from such treatments.


• | Tolerability and compliance issues. Currently approved pharmaceutical therapies for DED are typically administered in an eye-drop formulation and are commonly associated with ocular burning, reduced visual acuity and bad taste after application. The effective use of eye drops can be challenging for some patients and result in reduced compliance.

To address these limitations and the high unmet need expressed by patients, ECPs and payors, we have been developing OC-01, which we believe, if approved, has the potential to become the new standard of care for DED. However, there is no guarantee that it will provide revenues comparable to existing treatments. OC-01’s highly differentiated mechanism of action is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis, addressing the fundamental disease process, regardless of stage of disease or underlying cause. We are not aware of any other drug companies focused on activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway (TPP) and stimulating the LFU to increase tear production. OC-01 has demonstrated rapid onset of action to significantly improve signs and symptoms in the same patient population within a single registrational clinical trial. Furthermore, the novel delivery of 
OC-01 in a nasal spray spares the ocular surface and contributes to a favorable tolerability profile. To date, there have been no reports of burning or stinging to the ocular surface or negative effects on taste or smell in clinical trials of OC-01. We believe OC-01, if approved, has the potential to offer improved clinical outcomes and patient compliance based on its registrational trial results, favorable tolerability profile and rapid onset of action, therefore making it particularly suitable for use broadly across mild, moderate and severe patient populations.
Our approach: activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway to promote natural tear film production
To address these limitations and the high unmet need expressed by patients, ECPs and payors, we are developing a product candidate that we believe has the potential to serve as the new standard of care for DED. Our novel approach is designed to leverage the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate natural tear film production and re-establish tear film homeostasis. A healthy tear film protects and lubricates the eyes, washes away foreign particles, contains antimicrobials to reduce the risk of infection, and creates a smooth surface that contributes refractive power for clear vision.
The Trigeminal Parasympathetic Pathway
The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a division of the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for actions such as stimulating gland function, constriction of the pupil, slowing down heart rate and contractility, contracting bronchial musculature and stimulating bronchial secretions, and increasing gut motility for digestion. The parasympathetic nervous system controls tear film homeostasis and the activity of the LFU partially via the trigeminal nerve. The PNS uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter.
Anesthetizing the nasal mucosa has been shown to result in a 34% reduction in tear film production. This has also been observed in patients with reduced nasal air flow resulting from severe nasal allergy and patients with tracheostomy, suggesting that stimulation of the trigeminal nerve is important for tear production. Since then, additional studies have demonstrated a persistent decrease in aqueous tear production in patients with trigeminal nerve damage (such as trauma, trigeminal nerve ablation and herpetic infection) or pathology.
We refer to the communication between the trigeminal nerve and the LFU as the TPP. The efferent paths (away from the nose) of the TPP proceed from the superior salivary nucleus along the facial nerve to the geniculate ganglion and from there through the greater superficial petrosal nerve via the sphenopalatine ganglion to the LFU. Activating the TPP results in the stimulation of the Meibomian glands, lacrimal glands (main and accessory), and goblet cells comprising the LFU and promotes natural tear film production.
Targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) on the trigeminal nerve
Our approach to DED relies on a pharmaceutical stimulation of a class of receptors called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) that are located on the trigeminal nerve and readily accessible within the anterior nasal cavity. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that when bound by an agonist have the potential for ganglionic neurotransmission. The nAChRs subtypes found on human neurons are comprised of various homomeric (all one subunit) or heteromeric (at least one α and one ß subunit) combinations of 12 different nicotinic receptor subunits: α2-α10 and ß2-ß4. Stimulation of these receptors results in a rapid increase in cellular permeability to Na + and Ca 2+ resulting in depolarization of the cell membrane and initiation of an action potential. However, not all subtypes of nAChRs have the ability to activate the TPP (for example, treatment with a homomeric α7 agonist has no effect on this pathway). Additionally, the functional response of an nAChR to agonists is comprised of two dose-dependent, opposing effects: receptor activation after short exposure to high agonist concentrations (µM range), and desensitization upon prolonged exposure to low agonist concentrations (nM range).
Our product candidates OC-01 and OC-02 contain APIs that are highly selective to the nAChRs that activate the TPP. We believe this is the first application of nAChR agonists to be delivered nasally to stimulate the nerves of the PNS. Additionally, we have found that OC-01 and OC-02’s unique receptor binding characteristics and the localized nasal delivery allows for short-term agonist exposure with a high local concentration, and, once absorbed across the nasal mucosa, results in low systemic exposure and therefore avoids desensitization.
Our Product Candidates
OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray for Dry Eye Disease
Our lead product candidate OC-01 is being developed as a nasal spray to treat the signs and symptoms of DED. The API of OC-01, varenicline, is a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist with full agonist activity at the α7 receptor and partial agonist activity at the α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, and α4α6ß2 receptors. Varenicline tartrate, marketed as Chantix, was developed and commercialized by Pfizer as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. The compound was studied in multiple dose-ranging, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies as well as two confirmatory Phase 3 studies to study the safety and efficacy in otherwise healthy smokers in the United States. In 2006, varenicline was approved by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency and subsequently has been approved in more than 80 other countries throughout the world. To date, varenicline oral tablets have been prescribed to more than 20 million patients worldwide, including more than 11 million adults in the United States.
OC-01 is a preservative-free, aqueous nasal spray designed to be delivered twice daily to each nostril in a 50 µl spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. The highest intranasal concentration of varenicline being studied in ONSET-1 and ONSET-2 is 1.2 mg/ml, approximately ten-fold lower than the maintenance dose of Chantix (2 mg/day) on a nominal daily dosing basis. The lower dose of 0.6 mg/ml varenicline being studied in these two registrational trials is approximately 20-fold lower than the maintenance dose of oral Chantix on a nominal daily dosing basis.
OC-01’s novel mechanism of action
OC-01’s novel mechanism of action is designed to re-establish tear film homeostasis by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, activating the TPP and stimulating the glands and cells responsible for natural tear film production. We believe that the development of OC-01 as a nasal spray represents the first pharmacological treatment approach for DED targeting the nerves that control the LFU. OC-01, when sprayed into the anterior portion of the nasal cavity, stimulates nAChRs located on the chemosensory endings of the trigeminal nerve resulting in cholinergic neurotransmission.
Once OC-01 is bound to an nAChR, it stabilizes the open state of the ion channel allowing influx of cations such as Ca2+ and Na + ions, thus creating an action potential. This action potential ultimately activates the glands and cells of the LFU to produce natural tear film. Once the nasal spray is delivered, it takes approximately 10-15 seconds before tear film is produced. The receptors can be in the activated state for many minutes to hours after stimulation (a process termed smoldering activation).
We believe that increasing tear film volume and re-establishing tear film homeostasis will address the fundamental characteristic in the development and treatment of DED, regardless of etiology, and has the potential to treat a broad population of patients throughout the dry eye continuum.
Our development program for OC-01
In October 2018, we reported results from ONSET-1, a multicenter, dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo (vehicle)-controlled, registrational Phase 2b clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 in 182 subjects with DED in the United States. Following ONSET-1, we initiated a Phase 3 registrational clinical trial (ONSET-2) in July 2019 and expect to report top-line results by the end of the second quarter 2020.
We also completed a comparative pharmacokinetic “bridge” trial (ZEN) to evaluate the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally (Chantix) and reported top line results in November 2019. The exposure levels following nasal spray administration of varenicline are significantly lower than those seen with oral varenicline. If the FDA determines that the results of this trial establish an adequate bridge between OC-01 and Chantix, it will allow us to reference certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline from the Agency’s review of the Chantix 
NDA. If both ONSET-2 and ZEN are successful, we intend to submit the results of ONSET-2 and ZEN together with the results from ONSET-1 as part of a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2020.
In January 2020, we reported results from MYSTIC, a randomized, single-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 in 123 subjects with DED. The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of OC-01 nasal spray administered for 84 days. Although the study will add to the totality of the data in support of the efficacy of OC-01 nasal spray in subjects with DED, the MYSTIC data will only be used to support the safety of OC-01 in terms of NDA submission.
Statistical Significance
In the description of our clinical trials below, n represents the number of patients in a particular group and p or p-values represent the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value=0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the placebo group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). A p-value ≤ 0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities. The confidence interval (CI) means a range of values for a variable of the measure of treatment effect, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable.
ONSET-1: Phase 2b clinical trial results
In ONSET-1, OC-01 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of DED. The study compared three different doses of OC-01 to placebo. The pre-specified primary (sign) endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by Schirmer’s Score (compared to the baseline Schirmer’s Score) at Week 4 and the two pre-specified secondary (symptom) endpoints were patient-reported symptoms of DED as measured by EDS at Weeks 3 and 4. We also evaluated corneal fluorescein staining, a marker of corneal epithelial cell health, at Week 4, as an exploratory endpoint in ONSET-1. Due to the relatively small sample size of the study and the use of the controlled adverse environment chamber (CAE) that can exacerbate staining, ONSET-1 was not designed or powered to assess statistical significance for this endpoint. Baseline disease characteristics were generally similar across all treatment groups, with the exception of the 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 dose group where lower average disease severity was observed as indicated by a higher mean Schirmer’s test (5.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 4.5 to 5.2 mm) and a lower mean EDS (53.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 63.7 to 65.6 mm).
Although we cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant marketing approval for OC-01 based on the use of these endpoints, ONSET-1’s pre-specified endpoints are consistent with those that have been previously utilized in clinical trials of FDA-approved products for DED. The Schirmer’s Score, which was the same primary sign endpoint used in the FDA’s approval of Restasis, is determined by placing a test strip in the lower eyelid pouch and measuring the length of the test paper strip that is moistened after five minutes. Sometimes a topical anesthetic is placed into the eye before the filter paper to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the paper. The study eye was pre-defined as the eye that met eligibility criteria in the study and in the event that both eyes met criteria, was the eye with more tearing at baseline upon stimulation or in the event that both eyes were again equal, the eye with the worse baseline Schirmer’s Score. The fellow eye is the eye that was not defined as the study eye and may or may not have met all study eligibility criteria. The EDS, which was the primary symptom endpoint used in the FDA’s approval of Xiidra, is based on the patient’s rating of eye dryness on a visual analog scale (where 0=no discomfort and 100=maximal discomfort) with respect to both eyes. The study was designed and pre-specified to statistically analyze the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 dose groups. The study was not designed to formally analyze the 0.12 mg/ml dose group to avoid spending statistical power on a dose that was not hypothesized to provide clinically meaningful results. Therefore, no p-value is formally reported for the 0.12 mg/ml dose group.
The study design is included below:
Figure 1. ONSET-1 Study Design
In ONSET-1, the 182 subjects were randomly sorted into the four treatment groups following assessment of each subject’s baseline Schirmer’s Score and EDS. The mean baseline disease characteristics across all treatment groups were generally similar with the exception of the 1.2 mg/ml OC-01 dose group. In this group, subjects showed lower baseline disease severity, with a higher mean Schirmer’s Score (5.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 4.5 to 5.2 mm) and a lower mean EDS (53.5 mm) relative to the other dose groups (range: 63.7 to 65.6 mm).
As shown in Figure 2, a statistically significant improvement in Schirmer’s Score at Week 4 was observed in all three doses compared to placebo. The 0.6 mg/ml was associated with a least squares (LS) mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 11.4 mm (95% CI 8.9-13.9; p<0.001). The 1.2 mg/ml dose group was associated with a LS mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 11.1 mm (95% CI 8.5-13.7; p<0.001). The 0.12 mg/ml dose group was not formally tested, although it was associated with a LS mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 10.1 mm. Anesthetized Schirmer’s Score results were similar in the fellow eyes of subjects (p<0.01).

Intent to Treat (ITT) population analysis is an analysis of all randomized subjects, regardless of whether they received study treatment.
The proportion of subjects who had a change of greater than or equal to (or ≥) 10 mm in Schirmer’s Score from baseline at Week 4 was statistically significantly higher compared to subjects treated with placebo (vehicle nasal spray; 6 of 43 subjects, 14%) in the 0.6 mg/ml (25 of 46 subjects, 54%; 95% CI 40-69; P<0.001) and 1.2 mg/ml (19 of 40 subjects, 48%; 95% CI 32-63; P=0.001) dose groups. Similar changes from baseline were observed for the OC-01 0.12 mg/ml group (21 of 47 subjects, 45%; 95% CI 30-59; P=0.001).
ONSET-1 had two pre-specified secondary endpoints. The first secondary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to Week 4 in EDS (both eyes). As shown in Figure 3, a statistically significant reduction in mean EDS from baseline to Week 4 was 
observed in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, with a LS mean change from baseline EDS of -19.0 mm (95% CI -26.2 to -11.7; p=0.021). The LS mean change from baseline EDS to Week 4 for the 1.2 mg/ml dose group was -15.4 mm (95% CI -23.3 to -7.5; p=0.13).
The other secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 3 in mean EDS at five minutes post treatment in the CAE. As shown in Figure 3, a statistically significant reduction in mean EDS from baseline to Week 3 at five minutes post treatment in CAE was observed in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, with a LS mean change from baseline EDS of -16.0 mm (95% CI -21.3 to -10.6; p=0.006). The LS mean change from baseline EDS to Week 3 at five minutes post treatment in CAE for the 1.2 mg/ml dose group was -18.4 mm (95% CI -24.3 to -12.5, *p<0.001). As the first secondary outcome was statistically different from placebo only in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, change in EDS was formally tested in that dose group alone. At Week 3, in the CAE, the LS mean difference in change from baseline of the EDS between the 0.6 mg/ml dose and placebo groups at five minutes post treatment in CAE was -11.6 mm (95% CI -20.1 to -3.0; p=0.006). The LS mean difference between the 1.2 mg/ml dose and placebo groups in the change from baseline EDS was -14.0 mm (95% CI -22.9 to -5.1). While no formal analysis was performed on the 1.2 mg/ml dose group, as this dose group was not statistically significant in the first secondary endpoint, the nominal p-value was p<0.001.

Sensitivity analyses at ten and fifteen minutes post treatment in the CAE showed similar reductions in EDS as those seen at five minutes post treatment in subjects treated with OC-01 compared to subjects treated with placebo.
ONSET-1 was not designed or powered to assess corneal fluorescein staining, although we did ultimately measure this as an exploratory analysis using the National Eye Institute Corneal Fluorescein grading scale. This scale measures corneal staining in five distinct regions on the cornea: central, superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal, as well as a total score that includes all regions. At Week 4, in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group, total corneal staining (95% CI -2.9 to -0.2; p=0.020), nasal corneal staining (95% CI -0.8 to -0.0; p=0.026), and inferior corneal staining (95% CI -0.8 to -0.1; p=0.006) showed a statistically significant benefit as compared to placebo. There was a directional benefit in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group favoring OC-01 in central, superior, and temporal staining as compared to placebo. We believe that this is the only registrational study to show a statistically significant benefit in corneal fluorescein staining as soon as Week 4. There was no statistically significant benefit in corneal fluorescein staining in 1.2 mg/ml dose group, although there was a directional benefit favoring OC-01 in total, central, temporal, inferior, and nasal staining as compared to placebo.
OC-01 was well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study with only one serious adverse event reported (in the 0.6 mg/ml dose), which was not suspected to be related to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events in ONSET-1 were non-ocular, whereas reports of ocular adverse events were few and transient. Only one subject each in the 0.12 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml dose groups and two subjects in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group reported ocular adverse events compared to seven subjects in the placebo group. Of these reported events, reduced visual acuity was reported by one subject each in the 0.12 mg/ml and 0.6 mg/ml dose groups compared to three subjects in the placebo group, and each instance of reduced visual acuity reported was resolved by the next visit. No other ocular adverse event was reported by more than one subject.
Four subjects discontinued the study due to adverse events. One subject in the 0.6 mg/ml dose group withdrew from the study after one day of treatment due to dizziness. Three subjects in the 1.2 mg/ml dose group withdrew from the study. The first subject withdrew from the 1.2 mg/ml dose group after one day of treatment due to sneezing and throat irritation. The other two subjects withdrew from the 1.2 mg/ml dose group after two days of treatment due to (i) nasopharyngitis and (ii) tinnitus, headache and eyelid edema, respectively. No subjects withdrew from the study after the second day of treatment. The most commonly reported non-adverse events in ONSET-1 were sneezing and coughing, as shown in Figure 4 below. No subjects in the placebo group reported either sneezing or cough.
Figure 4. Non-Ocular Adverse Events Occurring in More than One Subject in any Treatment Group
Based on OC-01’s clinical trial results in ONSET-1 and its rapid onset of action, we believe that OC-01, if approved, has the potential to become the standard of care and redefine how DED is treated for millions of patients.
ZEN: Phase 1 comparative pharmacokinetic clinical trial results
We completed a comparative pharmacokinetic “bridge” trial (ZEN) where we evaluated the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered as a nasal spray (OC-01) compared to varenicline administered orally (Figure 5). We reported positive top-line results in November 2019. ZEN is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of OC-01 compared to varenicline administered orally. The study design is included below: 
Figure 5. ZEN Study Design 
The ZEN study was designed to assess the relative bioavailability of varenicline administered intranasally at its highest intended clinical strength (1.2 mg/ml in a 50 microliter nasal spray) compared to varenicline administered as a single oral dose at 
its commercially available maintenance oral tablet strength (1 mg). The treatment cohort consisted of 22 healthy volunteers between 18-65 years of age meeting all other study eligibility criteria who were randomized (Treatment Period 1) to receive an intranasal dose of 0.12 mg OC-01 (50 µL spray of 0.06 mg into each nostril) or a single 1 mg oral dose of varenicline. Both administrations were delivered while the subject was in an overnight fasted state. Subjects then returned at least 14 days later (Treatment Period 2) to receive the alternate dose of varenicline that was delivered at Treatment Period 1.
Top-line results (Figure 6) indicate that the relative bioavailability (systemic exposure as defined by adjusted geometric mean AUC0-inf) was 13 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength varenicline tablet (7.46 vs. 99.67 h*ng/ml). Maximal concentration (as defined by adjusted geometric mean Cmax) was 14 times lower for a single dose of the highest strength of OC-01 nasal spray as compared to a single dose of the highest strength varenicline tablet (0.32 vs. 4.55 ng/ml). 
The study demonstrated that OC-01 nasal spray was safe and well-tolerated at the doses tested. The number of subjects reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was 13 out of 21 (61.9%) after nasal spray administration and 9 out of 22 (40.9%) after oral tablet administration but there were no reports of serious TEAE noted with either oral or nasal administration. The most common adverse events in the nasal spray group were sneeze in 7 volunteers (33.3%) and cough in 6 volunteers (28.6%). All events were mild. There were no events of sneeze or cough in the oral tablet administration group. The most common adverse events in the oral tablet administration group were nausea in 5 volunteers (22.7%) and vomiting in 4 volunteers (18.2%). All events were mild or moderate in severity. There were no events of nausea or vomiting in the nasal spray administration group. 
Figure 6. ZEN Study Results: Mean (+/-SD) Systemic Exposure for Nasal Varenicline and Oral Varenicline
Plasma concentration values below the LLOQ (0.1) are presented as '0' (zero) in the arithmetic mean calculations.
Treatment A: Single oral dose of 1 mg varenicline (Chantix®) administered orally;
Treatment B: Intranasal dose of 0.12 mg OC-01 (varenicline)- delivered as a 50 μL (0.06 mg) spray into each nostril.
This trial could allow us to reference certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline tartrate from the Agency’s review of the Chantix NDA. The FDA has indicated that reliance upon the varenicline tartrate data in our 505(b)(2) NDA submission would be considered scientifically justified if exposure levels following nasal spray administration of our final clinical formulation are less than or equal to that of Chantix at its approved dose and route of administration. 
MYSTIC: Phase 2 clinical trial results 
The MYSTIC study was a randomized, single-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 in 123 subjects with Dry Eye Disease at the Asociación para Evitar la Ceguera (APEC) in Mexico City. APEC is the largest specialized ophthalmology hospital in North America by patient volume. The study compared two different doses of OC-01 nasal spray (0.6 mg/ml or 1.2 mg/ml) to vehicle control nasal spray (1:1:1 randomization). The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of OC-01 nasal spray administered for 84 days. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by mean change in Schirmer’s score at Day 84 as compared to vehicle control. The study design is included below: 
Figure 7. MYSTIC Study Design
As shown in Figure 8, a statistically significant improvement in Schirmer’s Score at Day 84 was observed in both doses as compared to placebo. The 0.6 mg/ml dose was associated with a least squares (LS) mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 10.6 mm (95% CI 7.9-14.0; p<0.05), while the 1.2 mg/ml dose was associated with a least squares (LS) mean change from baseline Schirmer’s Score of 11.0 mm (95% CI 7.9-13.4; p<0.05). Results were statistically significant in both the observed and Last Observation Carried Forward analyses. 
Figure 8. MYSTIC: Primary (Sign) Endpoint
OC-01 was well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study with no serious adverse events reported suspected to be related to the study drug. The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events in MYSTIC were non-ocular, whereas reports of ocular adverse events were few and transient. The number of subjects reporting non-ocular treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in any dose group was 6 out of 41 (14.6%) in each OC-01 nasal spray dose groups and 9 out of 41 (22.0%) in the vehicle control group. There were no reports of serious TEAE in the study and no serious adverse events related to study drug administration. The most common overall adverse events in the nasal spray groups were blurry vision, sneezing, and headache. All events were mild in the OC-01 nasal spray groups and resolved by the next visit.

ONSET-2: Phase 3 clinical trial
ONSET-2 is a multicenter, dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo (vehicle)-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of OC-01 in approximately 750 subjects with DED in the United States The study design is included below:
Figure 10. ONSET-2 Study Design 
We expect to report top-line results from this second registrational trial by the end of the second quarter 2020. 
Regulatory
We met with the FDA in February 2019 for an end of Phase 2 meeting following the completion of ONSET-1, and the FDA indicated that ONSET-1 could serve as one of the two pivotal safety and efficacy studies required to support a 505(b)(2) NDA filing for OC-01. Based on this feedback, we initiated ONSET-2, a 750-subject, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, in July 2019. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OC-01 at 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml doses as compared to placebo on signs and symptoms of DED. Assuming the effect size seen in ONSET-1, and based on this sample size, the power for each dose for both sign and symptom endpoints would be 99% or greater. This study, in addition to ONSET-1, allows us to achieve the minimum number of subjects for safety-monitoring purposes. This study has similar eligibility criteria and design to ONSET-1.
We met with the FDA again in July 2019 for another end of Phase 2 meeting focused on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) with regard to OC-01. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss with the FDA our proposed manufacturing plan that included stability testing, microbiology testing, and the size of our drug product registration batches to support NDA submission. We will continue to engage with the FDA in an ongoing fashion on manufacturing topics as we move toward commercialization of OC-01.
Developing OC-01 for additional indications associated with and beyond DED
Leveraging our nAChR domain expertise, we continue to explore the development of OC-01 for a number of potential indications and uses associated with and beyond DED including neurotrophic keratitis, dry eye associated with contact lens intolerance, and ocular surface treatment for refractive surgeries.
Neurotrophic keratitis
Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is caused when the nerves that supply the cornea cannot function properly. NK reduces sensitivity of the cornea. When the cornea senses stimulation or pressure, the eyelids will close and tears will be produced to protect the cornea and the eye. Because these nerves do not function properly in NK, the outer layer of the cornea, called the epithelium, can break down, resulting in an epithelial defect. In more advanced NK, an interior layer called the cornea stroma can break down as well, resulting in thinning of the cornea. This is called stromal “melting.” In advanced stromal melting, the cornea can thin to a severe degree, which can result in a hole or opening to the inside of the eye, which can lead to infection and potentially loss of the eye. NK can lead to a variety of complications, including poor wound healing of the cornea, scarring of the cornea, and loss of vision. There are many different conditions that can damage the nerves serving the cornea.
A variety of therapies can be used to treat this disorder depending on how far the disorder has progressed in an individual. Most recently, Oxervate, a recombinant human nerve growth factor, has been approved for the treatment of NK. Unfortunately there are several limitations to this therapy, including that the product must be refrigerated, administered six times per day at two-hour intervals for eight weeks, and delivered with a pipette that can be cumbersome for self-administration. Additionally, the cost of the product is more than $90,000 for an eight-week course of therapy.
Normal tear film contains a number of biologically active growth factors including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor. We believe that stimulating natural tear film production twice daily for eight weeks may provide appropriate nourishment and lubrication that will be beneficial in treating NK. The study design is included below:
Figure 11. OLYMPIA Study Design
Preclinical data for OC-01
As varenicline was previously studied by Pfizer in support of the approval of NDA 21-928 for Chantix, the appropriate preclinical studies including toxicology studies in rats, dogs, mice, and monkeys with duration of single dose to 12 months, two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, standard battery of genotoxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, and special toxicology studies were performed.
OC-01 pharmacodynamic assessment
We conducted a non-GLP pilot study to examine the agonist effects of OC-01 at human neuronal nAChRs subtypes by utilizing Xenopus oocytes, overexpressing human α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, α4α6ß2 and α7 receptors, and a two-electrode voltage clamp design. Determination of the agonistic effects of OC-01 at the human α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, α4α6ß2 and α7 nAChRs revealed that OC-01 has full agonist activity at the α7 receptor and partial agonist activity at the α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, and α4α6ß2 receptors.
OC-01 toxicology studies
In support of the approval of NDA 21-928, a number of preclinical studies including toxicology studies in rats, dogs, mice, and monkeys with duration of single dose to 12 months, two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, standard battery of genotoxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, and special toxicology studies were performed by Pfizer. We have also conducted repeat-dose toxicity studies of OC-01 in rats and rabbits for up to 28 days and a 26-week study in Dutch Belted rabbits is ongoing. This section includes a summary of the preclinical experience with varenicline to date, although it is not an exhaustive review of all studies performed to support the approval of varenicline.
Repeat-dose, seven-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-01 administered three times daily by intranasal instillation to Sprague-Dawley rats did not result in any mortality, adverse clinical signs, macroscopic findings or microscopic findings in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx. Based on these results, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 3.6 mg/day.
Repeat-dose, seven-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-01 in Dutch Belted Rabbits did not result in any mortality, adverse clinical signs, macroscopic findings or microscopic findings in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx when given three times daily by intranasal instillation to Dutch Belted rabbits at doses up to 12.0 mg/day. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered to be 12.0 mg/day.
Repeat-dose, 28-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-01 administered twice daily by intranasal instillation to Sprague-Dawley rats did not result in any mortality, and no OC-01-related adverse clinical signs or changes in bodyweight, food consumption, ophthalmology, electroretinography (ERGs) and functional observational battery (FOBs) were observed during the study. Administration of OC-01 three times daily for 28 days by intranasal instillation was well tolerated in the rats at levels up to 0.9 mg/day for the males and 0.18 mg/day for the females. Repeat-dose, 28-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-01 did not result in any changes to mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, nasal assessment, ophthalmology (including ERG and intraocular pressure), Schirmer’s Score, clinical pathology, gross pathology, and histopathology when given two times daily by intranasal instillation to Dutch Belted rabbits at doses up to 8.0 mg/day. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered to be 8.0 mg/day.
A repeat-dose, six-month GLP toxicology study in Dutch Belted rabbits completed in 2019 evaluated the potential toxicity of OC-01 when administered twice daily at doses up to 8.0 mg/day with a full report to be provided first half of 2020.

OC-02 (simpinicline) 
We are also developing a second nAChR agonist product candidate OC-02 (simpinicline), which has the ability to activate the parasympathetic nervous system in a similar fashion to OC-01. OC-02 shows full agonist activity at the α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, and α4α6ß2 receptors and weak agonist activity at the α7 receptor. We have studied OC-02 in two Phase 2b clinical trials (PEARL and RAINIER) for DED. Despite positive efficacy and safety results demonstrated in both trials, we selected OC-01 as our lead product candidate for DED due to its favorable clinical profile, the potential to leverage the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and significantly lower cost of development. We do not currently intend to pursue FDA approval for OC-02 in DED. However, we believe that the strong clinical data from both OC-01 and OC-02 validates this class of receptors and our mechanism of action. We believe that targeting the parasympathetic nervous system through the use of locally administered cholinergic agonists has the potential to treat a wide range of diseases and disorders. We have identified several indications other than DED where we believe 
OC-02 could provide a meaningful benefit to patients. In certain indications, we believe OC-02 could advance directly into a Phase 2 proof of concept study, supported by the preclinical and clinical data that we and others have generated in DED as well as other systemic indications. However, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will permit us to advance OC-02 into a Phase 2 proof of concept study nor can we guarantee that the FDA will grant marketing approval to OC-02 for the treatment of any indication.
Our development program for OC-02
PEARL: Phase 2b clinical trial results
In July 2018, we reported results from PEARL, a multicenter, dose-ranging, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and preliminary safety of OC-02 in 165 patients with DED in the United States. The study compared three different doses of OC-02 to placebo. The first pre-specified co-primary (sign) endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by Schirmer’s Score at Day 1 and the second pre-specified co-primary (symptom) endpoint was patient-reported symptoms of DED as measured by EDS in the CAE at Week 2. The study design is included below:
Figure 13. PEARL Study Design
The PEARL study was important in validating that an nAChR agonist delivered as a nasal spray could improve the signs and symptoms of DED, endpoints that had not been previously achieved in a single clinical trial by currently marketed therapies in their respective development programs. As shown in Figure 14, a statistically significant improvement in Schirmer’s Score was observed at Day 1 in all three doses compared to the vehicle-controlled placebo. The 1.1 mg/ml dose group was associated with a mean change in Schirmer’s Score of 8.6 mm (p=0.0018). A mean change in Schirmer’s Score of 17.1 mm (p<0.0001) was observed in the 5.5 mg/ml treatment group. A mean change in Schirmer’s Score of 19.3 mm (p<0.0001) was observed in the 11.1 mg/ml treatment group. The mean change in Schirmer’s Score in the control arm was observed to be 2.6 mm. Also shown in Figure 14, fellow eye results were similar.
Figure 14. PEARL: Co-Primary (Sign) Endpoint

1 | ANCOVA primary analysis. ITT-observed population.

Although the low dose of 1.1 mg/ml of OC-02 was associated with a statistically significant improvement in anesthetized Schirmer’s Score, it did not yield a statistically significant difference in the symptom endpoint of EDS (p=0.4640) as shown in Figure 15. A mean change in EDS of -16.5 mm was observed in the 5.5 ml/mg dose group (p=0.0067). A mean change in EDS of -19.0 mm was observed in the 11.1 mg/ml dose group (p=0.0006). The control arm had a mean change in EDS of -6.8 mm.
Figure 15. PEARL: Co-Primary (Symptom) Endpoint

1 | ANCOVA primary analysis ITT-observed population

OC-02 was observed to be well tolerated at all doses assessed in the study. Only one serious adverse event was reported and determined to be unrelated to the study drug. The most common adverse events were typical of nasal sprays (cough, throat irritation, sneezing) and were predominantly mild, transient and self-limiting.
RAINIER: Phase 2b clinical trial results
In October 2018, we reported results from RAINIER, a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 11.1 mg/ml OC-02 in 53 subjects with DED in the United States. At the time of the study, the sample size was limited by the amount of available OC-02. The study design is included below:
Figure 16. RAINIER Study Design
The study’s sole pre-specified endpoint was the assessment of tear production as measured by anesthetized Schirmer’s Score at Week 4. As shown in Figure 17, although the results were not statistically significant for the pre-specified endpoint, OC-02 was associated with an increase in tear film production as measured by an improvement in Schirmer’s Score in the study eye at Week 4 compared to the vehicle-controlled placebo. The OC-02 treatment group had a mean change in Schirmer’s Score of 10.5 mm (p=0.076). The vehicle-controlled placebo treatment group had a mean change in anesthetized Schirmer’s Score of 5.7 mm. Also shown in Figure 17, the anesthetized Schirmer’s Score results were statistically significant in the fellow eyes of subjects (p=0.003).
Figure 17. RAINIER: Primary (Sign) Endpoint

1 | ANCOVA, Least Squares mean. ITT-observed population.

OC-02 was observed to be well tolerated at the 11.1 mg/ml dose assessed in the study. The most common adverse event in all treatment groups was sneezing, which was temporally related to the administration of the study drug and resolved soon after administration. Sneezing adverse events were characterized as mild to moderate, with no severe adverse events reported.
Preclinical data for OC-02
OC-02 pharmacodynamic assessment
A non-GLP pilot study was conducted to examine the agonist effects of OC-02 at human neuronal nAChRs subtypes by utilizing Xenopus oocytes, overexpressing human α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, α4α6ß2 and α7 receptors with a two-electrode voltage clamp design. OC-02 was shown to be a weak agonist at the α7 receptors, evoking only 24% of the maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-evoked current at the highest dose tested. In contrast, OC-02 evoked two times the maximal Ach-evoked current at the highest dose tested at the α4ß2 receptor. Moreover, at the α3ß4 and at α3α5ß4 receptors, OC-02 was shown to evoke approximately 94% of the maximal ACh-evoked currents. OC-02 was shown to have full agonist activity at the α3ß4, α3α5ß4, α4ß2, and α4α6ß2 receptors and weak agonist activity at the α7 receptor.
OC-02 toxicology studies
Single-dose administration of the 5% dose of OC-02 in New Zealand White rabbits did not result in any test substance-related clinical observations, skin reactions inside or outside the nose, nasal reactions, gross observations at necropsy or histopathological effects for the seven-day evaluation period.
Repeat-dose, seven-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-02 did not result in any mortality, adverse clinical signs, macroscopic findings or microscopic findings in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx when given three times daily by intranasal instillation to Sprague-Dawley rats. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered to be 6%. Repeat-dose, seven-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-02 did not result in any mortality, adverse clinical signs, macroscopic findings or microscopic findings in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx when given three times daily by intranasal instillation to New Zealand White rabbits. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered to be 6%.
In repeat-dose, 28-day GLP toxicology studies, OC-02 was administered three times daily in Sprague-Dawley rats. There were no related adverse clinical signs or changes in bodyweight, food consumption, ophthalmology, ERGs and FOBs determined to be OC-02 related. Administration of OC-02 three times daily for 28 days by intranasal instillation was well tolerated in rats at levels up to 6%. Repeat-dose, 28-day GLP toxicology studies of OC-02 did not result in any changes to mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, nasal assessment, ophthalmology (including ERG and intraocular pressure), Schirmer’s Score, clinical pathology, gross pathology, and histopathology when given three times daily by intranasal instillation to Dutch Belted rabbits at doses up to 8.0 mg/day. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered to be 6%.
A repeat dose, six-month GLP toxicology study in Sprague-Dawley rats completed in 2019 evaluated the potential toxicity of OC-02 when administered twice daily at doses up to 3.98 mg/day. A repeat dose, nine-month GLP toxicology study in New Zealand White rabbits completed in 2019 evaluated the potential toxicity of OC-02 when administered twice daily at doses up to 13.28 mg/day. A full report will be available in the first half of 2020.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
A number of therapies are currently available for the treatment of DED in the United States. The most commonly used treatments for DED in the United States are over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and three FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis, Xiidra and Cequa. Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability, but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis and Cequa, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra, a LFA-1 antagonist, address chronic inflammation associated with DED. Other treatment options include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. We are aware of many other companies developing therapies for DED, including Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Alcon, Aldeyra Therapeutics, Allergan, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Azura Ophthalmics, Bausch Health (Novaliq), HanAll BioPharma, Johnson & Johnson, Kala Pharmaceuticals, Mitotech, Novartis, Parion Sciences, ReGenTree, Silk Technologies, Sylentis, TopiVert Pharma, and TearSolutions.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Sales and Marketing
In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with a focused, specialty sales force that could consist of our own employees, outsourced sales professionals, or a hybrid model utilizing both internal and external resources. We believe that this commercial organization at the launch of OC-01 will consist of approximately 150 to 200 field sales representatives that will call on top-prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists. We believe an organization of this size would allow us to reach ECPs that collectively care for more than 80% of patients diagnosed with DED in the United States. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating patients with DED, we also anticipate deploying focused direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns for OC-01. We anticipate that our sales force could also support the commercialization of additional product candidates treating ocular diseases. We would expect to conduct most of the buildout of this organization following NDA approval of our product candidates. We expect to explore commercialization of OC-01 and potentially other 
product candidates in certain markets outside the United States, including the European Union, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing our product candidates. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates.
The product candidate OC-01 is a presentation of varenicline, the API, formulated into a nasal spray formulation comprised of phosphate buffer to provide appropriate pH control and sodium chloride to obtain suitable osmolality for a nasal spray. We believe the amounts of the API as well as OC-01 we currently have on hand are sufficient to complete ONSET-2 and ZEN. Additional cGMP API campaigns for varenicline are in process to ensure full supply for our commercial scale-up, validation and commercial launch activities if OC-01 is approved.
The product candidate OC-02 is a presentation of simpinicline, the API, formulated into a nasal spray formulation comprised of phosphate buffer to provide appropriate pH control and sodium chloride to obtain suitable osmolality for a nasal spray. We believe that we will be able to continue to obtain the OC-02 API on commercially reasonable terms for any future clinical trials.
Although we currently rely on separate, single CMOs as our sole suppliers for both the non-clinical and clinical supply for the OC-01 API and OC-02 API under cGMP protocols and a single CMO to manufacture OC-01 and OC-02 and to perform analytical testing services, it is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide OC-01 API and drug product manufacturing and analytical testing services, if possible, prior to submission of the NDA for OC-01. We expect that we can easily find additional OC-01 API manufacturers as the OC-01 API is a small molecule currently being manufactured by a number of suppliers throughout the world. Additionally, the drug product manufacturing is a simple compounding and aseptic filling operation that could also be transferred to additional CMOs as necessary.
Our third-party service providers, our third-party supply chain providers, their facilities and the OC-01 and OC-02 used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The cGMP regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Product candidates used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities’ requirements before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of OC-01 and OC-02 to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Our failure, or the failure to our third-party providers and supply chain providers, to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements could subject us to possible legal or regulatory action, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could have a material impact on clinical supplies of OC-01 or our other product candidates. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any 
patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.
Our patent portfolio as of December 31, 2019 contains approximately 15 issued and unexpired U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, and two pending patent cooperation treaty (PCT) applications that are solely owned by us and certain foreign counterparts of a subset of these patents and patent applications in foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and countries within the European Patent Convention and the Eurasian Patent Organization. Owing to the substantial cost of prosecuting patent application internationally, we have selectively and strategically abandoned certain of our patent applications in countries with smaller markets and/or a history of weak patent enforcement record. With respect to our candidate OC-01, our patents and patent applications include methods of treatment. With respect to our candidate OC-02, our patents and patent applications cover chemical composition, synthesis and preparation, formulations, and methods of treatment. We continue to seek to maximize the scope of our patent protection for all our programs. We have five issued U.S. patents relating to methods of treating dry eye disease, increasing tear production, and improving ocular discomfort using varenicline, as well as pharmaceutical formulations for local nasal administration of varenicline. The patents are U.S. Pat. Nos.: 9,504,644, 9,504,645, 9,532,944, 9,597,284 and 10,456,396. These patents expire in 2035.
In October 2016, we purchased simpinicline, the compound we refer to as OC-02 and all of the intellectual property rights in and to such compound, including the related know-how and patents, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, which was subsequently amended in November 2016 and May 2017 (as amended, the OC-02 Agreement). Under the OC-02 Agreement we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $37.0 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events. In March 2018, we made a payment of $1.5 million upon completion of the first of these milestones. The next milestone payment is payable on the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial of OC-02. Under the OC-02 Agreement, we are also obligated to make royalty payments at a mid-single digit percentage rates on net worldwide sales of the covered products. In addition, we are required to pay 15% of any (i) licensing revenue we receive that is related to OC-02 and (ii) revenue received from the sale of OC-02, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $10.0 million. We do not currently receive any licensing or sales revenue for OC-02.
We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future product candidates. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, service providers, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Licenses
On October 18, 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement (the License Agreement) with Pfizer. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Pfizer granted us non-exclusive rights under Pfizer’s patent rights covering varenicline tartrate and related salts thereof, including U.S. Patent Nos.: 7,265,119 and 6,890,927 to develop, manufacture, and commercialize our OC-01 varenicline product candidate for the treatment of any ophthalmic disease or condition via nasal administration in the United States.
Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment to Pfizer of $5.0 million. If we successfully commercialize OC-01, we may be required to pay to Pfizer a single milestone payment in the very low double-digit millions if we achieve a specified level of annual aggregate net sales of OC-01 within a specified timeframe. We will also be required to pay Pfizer tiered royalties on net sales of OC-01 by us, our affiliates, or sublicensees, at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens. Our royalty obligation to Pfizer will commence upon first commercial sale of OC-01 and will expire upon the later of (a) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity granted to Pfizer in connection with varenicline in the United States; and (b) the expiration or abandonment of the last valid claims of the licensed patents.
The License Agreement will terminate when all claims in all the licensed patents expire or are irretrievably abandoned, which we expect to be no later than August 2022. The License Agreement may be terminated earlier by us for any reason, or by Pfizer upon 60 days’ written notice for our uncured material breach (30 days in the case of non-payment), or immediately upon our insolvency.
Regulatory Pathway
Varenicline tartrate is currently marketed by Pfizer in the United States under the trade name Chantix as an aid to smoking cessation treatment. We have filed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to study varenicline for the 
treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and intend to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA, relying in part upon certain FDA conclusions regarding the safety of varenicline from the Agency’s review of the Chantix NDA.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, market acceptance of our products, and our reputation.
Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCD;


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA;


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.

The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
• | Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.
NDA Review
Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the 
FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing changes. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy conducted by or on behalf of the applicant. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations, new routes of administration, or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s prior findings of safety or effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA concerning each patent listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). Depending on the type of certification, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product, such as the 5 years of exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit brought by the holder of the listed patent, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the product is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing monitoring and record-keeping adverse event and other periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and product promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting 
drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the FDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;


• | suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Other Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
• | the federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
• | the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;


• | the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;


• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Effective April 1, 2020, Medicaid rebate liability will be expanded to include the territories of the United States as well. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, on January 31, 2019, HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, may affect rebates paid by manufactures to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, Medicaid managed care organizations, and those entities’ pharmacy benefit managers, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. On October 9, 2019, HHS, OIG and CMS issued two proposed rules that set forth modifications to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law and Physician Self-Referral Law (or the Stark Law) regulations to promote value-based and coordinated care arrangements. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
