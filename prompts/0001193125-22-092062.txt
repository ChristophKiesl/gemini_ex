ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Background 
 We were incorporated on September 17, 2021 as Starry Group Holdings, Inc. (Starry Group, us, we or the Company), a Delaware corporation and then wholly-owned subsidiary of Starry, Inc. (Starry), a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting the SPAC Merger (defined below) and serving as the publicly traded parent company of Starry following the closing of the Acquisition Merger (defined below). 
 FirstMark Horizon Acquisition Corp. (FirstMark) was formed on August 13, 2020 as a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation. FirstMark completed an initial public offering (the IPO) on October 8, 2020, following which the management of FirstMark undertook a search for a business combination. On October 6, 2021, the disinterested members of the board of directors of FirstMark approved, and on March 16, 2022, the shareholders of FirstMark approved, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 6, 2021 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), by and among FirstMark, Sirius Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FirstMark (Merger Sub), Starry and Starry Group. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the business combination was effected in two steps: (a) on March 28, 2022 (the SPAC Merger Effective Time), FirstMark merged with and into Starry Group (the SPAC Merger), with Starry Group surviving the SPAC Merger as a publicly traded entity and became the sole owner of Merger Sub; and (b) on March 29, 2022 (the Acquisition Merger Effective Date), Merger Sub merged with and into Starry (the Acquisition Merger and, together with the SPAC Merger and all other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Business Combination), with Starry surviving the Acquisition Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Starry Group. 
 Following the Business Combination, substantially all of the Companys assets and operations are held and conducted by Starry and its subsidiaries, and the Companys only assets are equity interests in Starry. Unless the context otherwise requires, we, us, our, Starry Group and the Company refer to Starry, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and to Starry Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries following the consummation of the Business Combination. 
 Overview 
 We have developed a unique and innovative solution to provide last mile fixed broadband using a proprietary fixed wireless technology stack operating in licensed spectrum. We design and build our own fixed wireless equipment, cloud-based network control plane and billing and operations support systems to run our network and provide our service. We deploy this technology across a variety of markets to provide a robust and competitively-priced broadband service to customers. The integration of our own technology and service delivery allows us to efficiently deploy new competitive broadband networks to connect communities across the country. 
 Since our inception, we have developed the technology, optimized the unit economics, acquired spectrum and deployed our network and acquired subscribers in Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, Denver, Washington, D.C., and Columbus. 
 We are Solving Hard and Important Problems 
 Our founders came together with a simple but ambitious goal to fundamentally change the broadband experience. They knew that if they could make broadband more accessible and affordable it would meaningfully improve peoples lives and have a transformative effect on society. The broadband industry is uncompetitive and internet infrastructure deployment is slow, resulting in legacy infrastructure that cannot keep pace with rapid technological change, and leaving millions of people unconnected or under-connected to the internet. Our founders knew that they could build something better, and they understood that there is a significant market opportunity if they solve these key issues: speed of deployment, cost of deployment and customer experience. 
 
1 


 Solving these problems requires new technology and a new broadband economic model with an intense focus on the customer. And this is what we deliver  our solution is to build a low-cost gigabit broadband platform that can be deployed rapidly, and with the highest customer satisfaction among the major broadband providers. 
 Our ability to dramatically reduce the cost of gigabit connectivity is a result of our unique vertical integration. We are an innovative wireless equipment and software developer, investing tens-of-millions of dollars in research and development; a network operator, deploying gigabit digital infrastructure to communities across the country; and a service provider, with the goal of bringing broadband to millions of consumers and small businesses. This is an incredibly unique strategy that few providers have attempted, especially at a national scale, but we believe this is the only path to a generational change in broadband. 
 As a research and development company, we created our own technology stack for gigabit, last-mile, fixed wireless connectivity, including smart antennas, phased arrays, transceivers, low noise amplifiers, monolithic microwave integrated circuits and a cloud-based network control plane. As a digital infrastructure owner and deployer, we have built a gigabit network that covered approximately 5.3 million households as of December 31, 2021. And as a service provider, we are bringing a new kind of consumer-oriented broadband service to tens-of-thousands of subscribers. 
 This new platform is not just technical and physical  its an entirely new approach to building digital infrastructure. We work with communities directly to meet their needs; we find new partners that have an interest in improving peoples lives; we put digital equity at the center of our mission; and we deploy a technology that blankets communities in gigabit broadband within months, not years. 
 This transformation of physical and virtual connectivity infrastructure makes peoples lives better and fulfills our mission to solve large societal problems. And although transforming broadband from the ground up with a new technological solution is incredibly hard, we are already making an impact and are just getting started. 
 Broadband Is Essential 
 The world changed when Vint Cerf and Bob Khan developed transmission control protocol and internet protocol, enabling data communications over wire, and when Tim Berners Lee opened the world to the power of the internet through the World Wide Web. Ever since, humanity, economics and global power have become digitized and physically and virtually interconnected in almost every way. 
 Robust internet access is now essential to participating in modern society. This is not just about streaming content, it is about accessing education, health care and work. Broadbands criticality has been obvious for years, but it was made clearer during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Connectivity empowers people. It provides economic freedom, connects us with friends and families, and is the gateway to culture and entertainment. Despite this, existing providers offer most people extremely poor broadband, and millions of people still lack any access to broadband. 
 We believe competition, especially from new and rapidly growing providers, is the solution. Giving people new choices helps connect the unconnected, forces new investment in infrastructure and drives down prices. Without competition, the broadband industry will continue to trend towards consolidation, and the unconnected and under-connected will be left behind forever. 
 This is what motivates us to constantly be better. 
 The Need for a New Platform 
 Broadband economics are largely static. Deploying a new fiber broadband network at scale with incumbent technology requires a generational investment. So, when we decided to tackle the problem of building a new competitive gigabit broadband network, we knew we had to transform the economic dynamics. Competing with incumbent cable and telecommunications companies at scale using traditional wired delivery solutions like fiber or coaxial cable would require a massive capital investment. It would also take far too long to deploy  potentially decades. And even if time and capital were solved, it would be hard to achieve the subscriber penetration necessary to pay back the investment. We knew we needed a different solution. We needed to go wireless. 
 
2 


 A wireless solution could leverage billions of dollars in investment from others, could leverage existing baseband radio technologies with broad adoption and low-cost profiles, and would allow us to control the majority of the cost structure. We also needed to recoup our investment within a reasonable time but with relatively low penetration. And for our customers, we needed a new service model that was designed to genuinely put them first. 
 And we wanted to bring our innovations to as much of the market as possible, improving digital equity for everyone. 
 The Starry Platform 
 Our platform is a hybrid network that leverages our own fixed wireless technologies to provide gigabit coverage across a wide area, while keeping costs low and customer satisfaction high. Here is how we do it: 

 | Use Licensed Millimeter Wave Spectrum. Fixed wireless solves the high-cost challenges of building out new fiber or coax networks, which is why we have acquired licenses in millimeter wave spectrum. This spectrum has the wide-channel bandwidths necessary to achieve low latency and gigabit capacity. It is also less expensive than acquiring lower band spectrum. Licensed spectrum is critical because the FCC permits licensees to operate at high transmit power and grants licensees protected rights in frequency and geography, allowing us to economically deploy a network that covers tens-of-millions of homes. And millimeter wave spectrum is ideal for fixed wireless networks deployed from rooftops above obstructions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Employ 802.11 Radios in Licensed Spectrum. Wi-Fi is one of the worlds most prevalent wireless technologies. It is based on a robust and frequently upgraded industry standard that enables high capacity and low-latency wireless connections. So instead of building a new radio technology or using the expensive mobile industry 5G ecosystem, we built our technology stack on top of Wi-Fis 802.11 standard. We then developed key intellectual property around the use of this radio technology in licensed spectrum domains with a combination of ultra-high spectral-efficiency smart-antenna technologies. The combination of proprietary front ends and global volume of Wi-Fi-based components allows us to achieve incredible cost advantages with a robust roadmap for capacity enhancements over time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Design and Build the Fixed Wireless Technology and Deploy it on Telecommunications Infrastructure. We knew early on that we needed to own our core technology to control our economic and technical destiny. Having spent nearly $200 million to develop and prove this technology, we can now iterate and upgrade rapidly as we continuously drive down the costs of our own equipment rather than paying inflated vendor margins to acquire third-party equipment. This also allows us to deploy our technology on existing infrastructure such as towers, rooftops and dark fiber. Sharing this infrastructure allows us to access a huge portfolio of assets at market rates instead of making massive investments in all new infrastructure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Control the Network with a Natively Cloud-Based Core. Broadband network owners are behind the curve on leveraging the scalable benefits of cloud-based software platforms. Incumbent systems are built on old legacy technologies that are difficult to upgrade and expensive to maintain. We built our entire network control system  in telecommunications terms, our network core, operations support system and business support system  on a custom cloud platform. Critically, this dynamic platform can flexibly scale as our business grows and lets us drive the control plane all the way into our customers homes to serve them better.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Create a Unique Partner Ecosystem. We are building a partner ecosystem of like-minded organizations that are motivated to play an active role in improving broadband in their communities. This ecosystem includes building owners that want better broadband for their residents, including in affordable housing communities; electric utilities that want to help ensure their communities can grow and prosper; construction firms with large craft labor teams to help build the next generation of digital infrastructure; housing owners and managers that want to make sure all people have access to quality broadband; digital equity organizations with missions to improve equity, inclusion and access; and government institutions that are working to improve connectivity in their communities.

 This is our platform, which allows us to build our network in a community with very low up-front capital investment, scale the customer network and our capital expenditures on a success basis as new customers come online, become EBITDA breakeven with only a projected four percent penetration rate across our network footprint and provide a service that consumers use hours a day with a net promoter score unrivaled by any broadband provider today. 
 Starrys Service 
 Transforming broadband requires providing customers with better technology and ensuring our service truly meets their needs. 
 We were frustrated broadband customers. Our intense customer focus is informed by decades of our own personal experiences. We believe in no more wait times, no more hidden fees and no more pricing games or anti-consumer service bundling. Our service is simple, straightforward, affordable and designed for our customers. 
 

We also take our customers privacy very seriously and have a modern and customer-oriented privacy policy that protects customer data rather than monetizes it. We are not a big data company or a digital ad platform. We collect as little data as we feel is necessary and use it only to offer and market our service. We feel the same way about net neutrality; our customers should have access to the entire legal internet, so we do not block or prioritize any content and do not cap the amount of data our consumers use. 
 And our customers love the service and experience. 
 Customer Response 
 Our intense focus on the customer experience leads to very happy customers. Our historic net promoter score (NPS) taken across all customers who have responded to our NPS survey since 2018 is 61. Our NPS through the end of 2021 is 69. This is dramatically better than other broadband providers, which have an average NPS of 0. In fact, it puts us on par with some of the most beloved consumer brands in the world.

This is a point of incredible pride in Starry across our entire workforce. From the beginning, our mission has been about delivering a new broadband experience that is designed around the customer. Not surprisingly, focusing on the customer, delivering a great experience and being transparent and honest leads to a very positive relationship with customers. 
 Digital Equity and Inclusion 
 We believe that broadband is transformational, and that it should be available to everyone. But across both urban and rural America, entire communities have been left unserved or underserved, written off by incumbent providers as too expensive to connect or not profitable enough to serve. We take a different view and incorporate digital equity into our mission in two principal ways. 
 First, we built a program specifically for people living in public and affordable housing: Starry Connect. Historically, lower income individuals have been subjected to unreasonable examinations of their personal finances in order to participate in low-income broadband programs. With Starry Connect we work with these communities, which are largely underserved and ignored, to better meet their digital connectivity needs. We lowered cost barriers and removed qualification barriers, such as credit checks and requirements that residents qualify for other federal welfare subsidy programs in order to participate. Our goal is to get people the broadband access they needed without stripping them of their dignity. Existing low-cost programs often require credit checks and lengthy application processes that are cumbersome at best and demeaning at worst. We knew we could do better. 
 By partnering with public and affordable housing owners, Starry Connect ties eligibility to the premise and not an individual, which enables blanket eligibility across a qualified housing community. Persons living in eligible communities do not need to apply to qualify for Starry Connect service because our low-cost service plan option is automatically available to anyone living in these communities. 
 Since launching Starry Connect in 2018 we have signed agreements with over 62 public and private affordable housing owners and managers representing more than 55,000 apartment units. 
 As part of our effort, we also partner with other organizations focused on digital equity including Microsoft and PCs for People to improve connectivity and lower barriers to device access and digital literacy programs. For example, we have worked with Microsoft to help fund our network deployment in several public housing communities in Los Angeles and New York City. We work creatively with our partners to devise connectivity solutions that meet the needs of its residents. In Colorado, for example, we are partnering with Aurora Public Schools to make our Starry Connect program available to students identified as unconnected or under-connected in select neighborhoods.

 Second, we participate in targeted programs to expand broadband access and improve broadband affordability. In 2020, we participated in the FCCs Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) auction to help accelerate our service delivery to locations that lack service today. We won $268 million in federal subsidies over ten years to deploy service to more than 100,000 locations in nine states. This is an integral part of our mission to connect all communities to better broadband, in both urban and rural areas. The FCC is currently reviewing our long-form applications prior to its final approval of the subsidy. 
 We are also a participating provider in the FCCs Emergency Broadband Benefit program since 2021, which provides a subsidy of up to $50 per month to qualifying households to cover the cost of broadband during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were approved to participate through our Starry Connect program, making all current and future customers living in these Starry Connect communities in our existing markets eligible for the program across all available speed tiers. Even though our Starry Connect service is low cost, we believe every bit of savings helps households in need. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have recognized approximately $0.6 million in revenue related to subsidies through the FCCs Emergency Broadband Benefit program. 
 Digital equity and inclusion are at the core of our mission, and we will continue to pursue strategies that align with those values as we scale our network to more communities nationwide, including expansion of our Starry Connect program and continued participation in targeted government programs and partnerships that extend broadband access and affordability to more communities across the country. 
 Our Technology Stack and Intellectual Property 
 Our network technology is fundamental to our unique and disruptive network economics. In 2015, we set out to build a new kind of wireless technology specifically designed for gigabit fixed wireless service using licensed millimeter wave spectrum. Since our founding, we have spent nearly $200 million on research and development and commercialization of our technology. This investment serves the dual goals of increasing our network capacity and improving our unit economics. 
 Broadband has historically been immune to technological disruption because it is complicated and requires an extensive investment of capital and time. Historically, broadband companies tried to use technology before it was mature or tried to innovate in the wrong places. We believe that true broadband disruption requires a technological solution that reduces the cost of the coverage network that require less capital and lower customer penetration.

 We began developing our technology on the front edge of the global 5G evolution because the compute power and core wireless components were developed enough to make it economically and technically feasible to build high-capacity, low-cost equipment that uses millimeter wave spectrum. 
 But we did not want to rely on the global 5G ecosystem for two reasons. First, we wanted to control our own technical and economic destiny. We did not want to become beholden to specific vendors or a technology stack controlled by mobile providers. Instead, we use design and contract manufacturing partners to control our costs. Second, the 5G ecosystem was not evolved enough to support our use case. This is still true today. Mobile carrier equipment that operates in millimeter wave spectrum under the mobile 5G standard (called 5G NR) does not support standalone two-way connections in millimeter wave spectrum. 
 For these reasons, we built our own technology stack from the ground up. We use 802.11 standard radios, which are supported by a robust global supply chain and research and development cycle that is focused on continually increased capacity and lower cost. These radios have similar characteristics of mobile 5G chips, most importantly multi-user MIMO, which is a technology that allows the radio to serve multiple end points simultaneously. We take these radios and upconvert the signal from unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum (spectrum in which Wi-Fi operates) to the licensed millimeter wave bands in which we operate. This is one of the most unique parts of the Starry technical stack  using a powerful off the shelf baseband radio and combining it with our own proprietary technology to convert the signal into licensed millimeter wave spectrum. From there, we build our own antenna systems for beamforming and beamsteering to direct our gigabit signal to end user locations. Combined, this technology stack allows us to transmit a gigabit signal over one mile and we believe creates a robust protective intellectual property moat. 
 Network Architecture 
 Below is a simplistic diagram of our network architecture. 
 

We deploy our base stations, called Titans, at high elevations above the clutter of the physical environment. We use whatever vertical infrastructure is available, including building rooftops, cell towers and utility poles, which we rent from the asset owners or managers, including the large tower companies. These are the transmitting sites that serve customer premises. Each Titan is connected to fiber backhaul or fixed wireless backhaul, which routes our network traffic back to a local internet point-of-presence in the market. 
 An internet point-of-presence is the network interface point, typically located in a data center, housing servers, routers, switches, and other networking equipment that enables connectivity between networks, and is a common network element of communications networks. These are the locations to which our network traffic in a 
 
7 


  region is routed and consolidated, and from where we connect with other networks to exchange data traffic, either through direct connections or through Internet exchange points. Internet exchange points are generally not- for-profit neutral associations through which networks exchange traffic. The data centers in which these internet points-of-presence are located are operated by third parties with whom we contract for access and use. In certain large markets we utilize more than one internet point-of-presence, primarily to ensure redundancy in the case of power outages that may affect a data center. 
 We primarily lease dark fiber from third parties and occasionally build our own fixed wireless links. In some instances, these fiber providers are companies that solely provide communications infrastructure services to internet service providers like us and in some instances these providers offer these services in addition to providing their own internet access services to retail and business customers. The number of available fiber backhaul providers varies by market. We generally contract with between two and four different providers in a market depending on the conditions in that market and the design of our network. In most markets, while we use multiple fiber providers, we lease the majority of our fiber from one provider. However, the fiber backhaul market is relatively competitive in urban areas, which is where we target our network deployment today. For example, there are at least seven fiber providers each in Boston, Denver, and Los Angeles; eight providers in Columbus; and ten providers each in New York City and Washington, D.C. Accordingly, we believe that if any current fiber backhaul provider in a market terminated or did not renew our leases with them, we would be able to find one or more alternative providers to ensure adequate access to fiber backhaul in that market. Because fiber providers generally lease fiber backhaul to customers like us on market-based terms and conditions, we do not believe that the terms and conditions for leasing fiber from a new provider would be materially worse than the terms and conditions of our current contracts. In most instances, we lease fiber for a set period of time, typically between 36 and 60 months, in exchange for a monthly fee. At the end of the term of a lease, we seek to renew the lease or let the lease terminate depending on the specific needs of the network at that time and our access to other fiber and the costs associated with it. 
 We generally design our transmitting sites to have diverse backhaul paths, which means that we typically have in place an alternative backhaul method for routing our network traffic if we lose access to fiber backhaul for any reason. The last mile network is Starry owned, and we primarily lease dark fiber for backhaul and site our Titans on rooftops and towers managed by third parties under commercial agreements with those infrastructure owners. 
 The Titan base stations serve our two kinds of customer terminals, which we call Trident and Comet. We install Tridents on larger apartment buildings (usually 60 units and greater). We install one Trident on the roof of the building, and then use the existing building wiring to distribute our service to subscribers within the building. We typically deploy our service without building out any of our own wiring in a building. Comet is our terminal for smaller buildings and single-family homes. A Comet has the same capacity as a Trident, but in a smaller form factor. We designed Comet to be easy to install  it requires only a single coax cable  and can serve up to 16 customers. 
 And we provide customers with a Wi-Fi router that runs our own network software. We believe this enhances the customer experience because the custom router provides us with network visibility all the way into the home network. Among other things, this allows us to monitor network uptime as a function of router uptime, which is a measure of actual customer experience and troubleshoot any issues in a more comprehensive way than simply asking what lights are blinking or asking the customer to unplug and reboot the router. 
 Finally, we have a mobile application that provides each customer with a suite of data self-help tools to help enhance their own control over their Wi-Fi network and help resolve any issues that arise. 
 The entire network is run on our own cloud-based core. Unlike traditional broadband providers, we do not have complicated and expensive vendor-run or legacy billing and operating systems. We built our entire control plane from the ground up. It is natively cloud-based and highly scalable. This system runs customer billing, network management, customer care and network operations. As a result, we do not have to maintain traditional network operations centers. Our network operations can access the entire network from their mobile devices with appropriate authentication and other access controls.

 Network Capacity 
 We invest heavily in research and development to both drive down the cost of our network and improve its capacity over time. While our current network technology is already gigabit, we are continuing to expand and upgrade our network with the maximum capacity improvements to meet expected future consumer demand. 
 Importantly, unlike traditional coax networks, our network is designed to be high capacity in both the downstream and upstream directions. As many consumers experienced through the COVID-19 pandemic when working from home, upstream capacity is important for live video streaming, large file transfers and cloud applications. 
 As the chart below shows, our network is designed to be high capacity today, with an upgrade path to multiples of todays capacity over the next five years. While the amount of bandwidth we may use is fixed (160 megahertz or 200 megahertz) we take advantage of the ability to operate simultaneous spatial streams, which allows us to reuse the same spectrum six, eight or fourteen times, effectively multiplying our bandwidth without requiring additional spectrum. 
 




1 | Assumes 64 subscribers per sector
--+----------------------------------

Starry Today 
 We spent approximately three years building our initial commercial technology stack and developing intellectual property, while creating and testing our business model and executing our spectrum strategy. This created a two-track trajectory where our network and subscriber base expanded, while we reduced our unit economics through additional investments in research and development. As a result, we now have a large and growing broadband platform with differentiated and improving economics. 
 Our company is a unique combination  we are an equipment developer, network owner and service provider. This structure is a key component of our new broadband economics. By developing our own equipment, owning our own network and offering our own service we believe we generate significant cost advantages relative to incumbent networks. 
 Network Coverage 
 We build out our network at high elevations to maximize the coverage from each base station location. The area that a base station or group of base stations at the same location covers is our Homes Serviceable, which is the total number of households that we could potentially technologically and commercially serve from any base station or site. Within that universe, we either have single family homes or smaller apartment buildings that we can directly serve, or for larger multiple dwelling units (MDUs), we have Large MDU Units and Activated MDU Units which are larger apartments to which we can market our service because the building is addressable, serviceable and has one of our transceivers installed. And from that universe we derive our customer relationship. 
 
9 


 
As of year-end 2021, we had approximately 5.3 million homes serviceable under our network across six live markets: Boston, Massachusetts; Columbus, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; and Washington, D.C. 
 

In all of our markets except Columbus, Ohio, we built our network incrementally while we shifted from a pure research and development function as we finalized our technology, to the active deployment of our network, to the acquisition of subscribers and provision of services. We iteratively deployed our network, designed operational 
 
10 


  systems, built teams and injected our learnings back into this process. We conceptualize this as applying iterative software development techniques to network deployment. This had inefficiencies early on, but ultimately resulted in an accelerated learning curve. We applied these learnings to our Columbus network, where we built our entire initial network within a 12-month period. 
 Going forward, we intend to build every new market in the same manner as Columbus  build the coverage network first and then launch service. 
 Between 2018 and 2021, we focused aggressively on continuing to reduce the network coverage capital expenditure allocation per subscriber by driving down the cost of our base stations and on developing our low cost customer terminal with a unit cost that allows us to target smaller multifamily dwelling units and single family homes while preserving our unique cost advantage. 
 Comet, our new customer terminal for medium and small multifamily dwelling units and single-family homes, now allows us to efficiently serve households of all types, dramatically changing our ability to acquire subscribers within our existing network coverage and within the footprint of every new transmitting site we build. 
 Subscribers 
 While we have built significant network coverage since beginning operations, until recently we have purposefully constrained our subscriber acquisition generally to only larger apartment buildings. We did this to optimize unit economics and efficiently deploy capital. Our technology development roadmap was focused on building our base stations and reducing their cost, while launching a customer terminal that would allow us to serve the largest number of customers at a location at the lowest unit cost. As a result, our unit economics were optimized for larger apartment buildings within our network footprint. 
 

We ended 2021 with 63,230 customer relationships. Within the MDUs that we provided service to as of the end of 2021, we achieved significant penetration with a steady penetration ramp as the buildings matured. We achieved 12% penetration in MDUs on average within thirty days of launching a building, 25% on average for buildings that were launched one or more years ago, and 32% on average for buildings that were launched three or more years ago. 
 
11 


 As our operations in a market mature, our penetration rate across the entire market grows. Prior to launching Comet in 2021, which as described in more detail below allows us to target all serviceable households, we targeted our deployment and sales at MDUs that were thirty units or larger. As an example of how our penetration of a market matures over time within the serviceable footprint that we target our sales, and even as the denominator  homes serviceable  continues to grow, the graph below shows the penetration of buildings that are thirty units or larger in a single market over time. 
 

In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Comet. This new customer terminal now enables us to serve every serviceable household. As a result, we are no longer constraining our subscriber acquisition to large apartment buildings. 
 

Partners 
 We are developing unique and highly accretive partnerships that we believe will help us build and scale our network while reducing our capital expenditure intensity. 
 As part of our expansion strategy, we are identifying partners that are aligned with our goal of improving connectivity in communities and have infrastructure experience and the ability to help finance our network 
 
12 


  expansion. In 2020, we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with AEP Ventures, LLC (AEPV), a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric Power, to deploy our network in Columbus, Ohio. Under our arrangement, AEPV absorbs the capital expenditures necessary to construct and maintain our coverage network and the capital expenditures for customer installations, while we operate the network, market our service, acquire subscribers and manage subscriber relationships. In exchange for this collaborative approach, we pay AEPV a portion of the revenue we receive from customers in the Columbus market. 
 In 2021, we entered into a strategic alliance with Quanta Services, Inc. (Quanta), a specialized contracting services company, delivering comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the communications, utility, renewable energy and underground industries Quanta has a wealth of expertise, a large, trained workforce and project management expertise built around large-scale infrastructure partnerships. Under our arrangement, Quanta will be our preferred partner in building and/or project managing the expansion of our network in portions of our network footprint. 
 In addition, we work collaboratively with residential and commercial property owners to deploy our network and acquire subscribers. These arrangements take the form of agreements with individual building owners to install our service in their buildings, agreements with large real estate portfolio owners to install our service across their portfolios, and agreements to allow us to install and operate our base stations on their building rooftops. Most notably, we have a commercial relationship with Related Companies, a global real estate and lifestyle company with over $60 billion in assets owned or under development, to deploy our network and service within their communities, including their affordable communities within our Starry Connect program. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 Spectrum 
 We hold spectrum licenses in the 24 GHz band. We won licenses in the 24 GHz band in FCC Auction 102, spending approximately $48 million to acquire 200 megahertz of spectrum in 49 Partial Economic Areas (PEAs), the geographic unit used by the FCC and 300 megahertz in two PEAs. The 24 GHz band is the lowest frequency licensed millimeter wave spectrum that the FCC has made available through auction. This is important because the lower frequency achieves better propagation with the same power. Technically, this allows us to cover more area with fewer base station sites. These license rights were granted for an initial 10-year term with an expectation of renewal subject to network buildout requirements, consistent with typical FCC rules for licensed spectrum bands. 
 We also have spectrum rights to the lower 37 GHz band. In 2016, the FCC established a lower 37 GHz band as a licensed coordinated shared band. At the time the FCC sought to create a millimeter wave band on a license basis that could be used with low barriers to entry in order to stimulate new innovation in 5G and other technologies. The fact that the band is licensed, but not auctioned, means that equipment can operate at higher transmit power  the same as mobile 5G  but the spectrum is not reserved only for those with deep pockets at auction. While the FCC finalizes its rules for the use of this band, it has authorized us to deploy our technology and operate our network in a number of markets under an experimental license. Upon promulgation of final rules by the FCC for use of the lower 37 GHz band, we will pursue permanent licensed rights through the FCCs process. 
 Growth 
 We intend to scale our network and subscriber base in coordination with residential property owners, affordable housing owners and managers, and digital equity partners. We intend to establish additional utility partnerships like our AEPV arrangement within additional markets in our footprint in order to continue to accelerate our network deployment and reduce our capital expenditure intensity. In addition, we intend to leverage our Quanta arrangement by building Quantas teams into our planning, design and deployment process as we build out our entire network footprint. 
Competition 
 We compete head-to-head against other fixed broadband providers, including cable, terrestrial fixed wireless service, DSL, fiber and fixed satellite. We also compete against providers of mobile broadband service to the extent that a consumer considers mobile broadband service a substitute for fixed broadband service. Our

  competitors include large national and regional providers of fixed broadband services such as AT&T, Comcast, Charter, CableOne, Verizon, CenturyLink, Frontier, TDS Cox, RCN and Altice, providers of mobile broadband services such as AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon, and numerous small fixed broadband providers in local areas. In any market, we may face one or more competitive providers. In some instances, our competitors have easier access to financing, greater resources, greater operating capabilities and efficiencies of scale, stronger brand-name recognition, longstanding relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, and more customers. This provides these competitors with certain advantages in competing against us, including the ability to aggressively promote and price their services in markets in which we may compete. This competition creates pressure on our pricing and may affect our ability to add and retain customers. 
 We believe our technology and business model enables us to compete effectively against incumbent providers on price, service quality and customer experience. Our service is offered at a price point that is generally at or below the promotional price of an incumbent, and in almost every case is below the rack rate price for an incumbent service. We also focus on price transparency. When a customer signs up for our service, the price they pay each month is what we quote to them. There are no hidden fees or charges. We charge our customers on a monthly basis, do not require long-term contracts and do not impose early termination fees. Our service speeds are better than existing cable incumbents in upload and can compete with fiber providers in most cases. On average, we provide our customers with speeds that are at or above their speed plans. Price and service are ultimately components of customer experience. We focus relentlessly on the customer experience and we have an industry-leading NPS as a result. 
 While we believe our service to be highly competitive, most incumbent broadband communications companies, which already have wired networks and an existing customer base and other operational functions in place, may offer their services at promotional prices comparable to or lower than our services. In addition, to the extent that these providers networks are more ubiquitously deployed, such as traditional telephone networks, they may be in a better position to offer internet services to consumers and businesses passed by their networks on a more economic or timely basis than we can, even if the services they offer are arguably inferior. They may also increasingly have the ability to offer a combination of video services, mobile services and telephone and internet services to their customers as a bundle, either directly or through co-marketing agreements with other service providers. As an internet-only company, we do not currently offer any bundled services that could compete with these offerings. 
 Mobile broadband providers may be able to provide services that substitute for our fixed broadband service. Current and future fixed and mobile internet services, such as services provided on LTE and 5G networks (and variants), other unlicensed fixed wireless broadband networks and devices such as mobile hot spots, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may also compete with our broadband services both for in-premises broadband service and mobile broadband. All major wireless carriers offer various kinds of unlimited data plans, which could, in some cases, become a substitute for the fixed broadband services we provide. In addition, the FCC is likely to continue to make additional radio frequency spectrum available for these wireless internet access services, which in time could expand the quality and reach of these services. 
 Our competitive risks are heightened by the rapid technological change inherent in our business, evolving consumer preferences and the need to acquire, develop and adopt new technology to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors, and to meet consumer demand. We may need to anticipate far in advance which technology we should use for the development of new products and services or the enhancement of existing products and services. New emerging technologies, including low earth orbit satellite, may impact a portion of our potential network expansion, to the extent such technologies come to fruition and are adopted in the marketplace. Consolidation and cooperation in our industry may allow our competitors to acquire service capabilities or offer products that are not available to us or offer similar products and services at prices lower than ours.

 | First and foremost, we are driven by delivering a great service at a fair price, and are obsessed with customer satisfaction. We push ourselves to go above and beyond because doing the bare minimum is an anathema to our culture.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have a bias for action; we empower all employees at every level of our company to make smart and quick decisions when confronted with problems or opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We trust that our colleagues make decisions that are anchored in a customer-first focus, and that those decisions are thoughtful and help drive us towards achieving our shared goals.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We use data and analytics to help make smart and strategic decisions, but we do not let data and analytics overwhelm us and create paralysis or inaction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have a passion for innovation and encourage intellectual curiosity. Innovation in the pursuit of solving hard problems is our motivation and we bring a conscientious and intentional approach to our solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
 Our culture is also one of inclusion. We actively work to dismantle inequities within our policies, systems, programs and services to ensure that Starry Group is a space where no one feels the need to edit their identity. We continuously aspire to be a more equitable, safe and welcoming work environment for all of our team members, and a better advocate to the communities we serve. We provide equal opportunities for growth, promotion, learning and development to all employees. We encourage employee engagement through LGBTQ and women employee resource groups, along with opportunities to discuss gender, race and LGBTQ issues. 
Seasonality 
 Our customers today are all residential subscribers, and the majority of our customers in the future will continue to be residential subscribers. There are some seasonal trends that affect our customer acquisition activities, and they can vary by market. Examples include markets with larger college and university student populations, which tend to move in and move out of residences within the same time frame. In addition, consumers naturally consider their broadband provider at the time at which they move to a new residence. To the extent that the velocity of moving changes over time, it would impact our subscriber acquisition and revenue. Our capital expenditures and working capital may also be subject to seasonality based on regional weather and natural events that may impact our ability to construct the network in certain circumstances.
