Item 1. Business.
Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative antibody therapeutics. Our pipeline of full-length human multispecific antibody candidates are generated from our proprietary technology platforms, which are able to generate a diverse array of antibody binding domains, or Fabs, against virtually any target. Each antibody binding domain consists of a target-specific heavy chain paired with a common light chain. Multiple binding domains can be combined to produce novel bispecific and trispecific antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets and display novel and innovative biology. These platforms, referred to as Biclonics® and Triclonics®, allow us to generate large numbers of diverse panels of bispecific and trispecific antibodies, respectively, which can then be functionally screened in large-scale cell-based assays to identify those unique molecules that possess novel biology, which we believe are best suited for a given therapeutic application. Further, by binding to multiple targets, Biclonics® and Triclonics® may be designed to provide a variety of mechanisms of action, including simultaneously blocking receptors that drive tumor cell growth and survival and mobilizing the patient’s immune response by engaging T cells, and/or activating various killer cells to eradicate tumors.
 
Our technology platforms employ an assortment of patented technologies and techniques to generate human antibodies. We utilize our patented MeMo® mouse to produce a host of antibodies with diverse heavy chains and a common light chain that are capable of binding to virtually any antigen target. We use our patented heavy chain and CH3 domain dimerization technology to generate substantially pure bispecific and trispecific antibodies. We also employ our patented Spleen to Screen® technology to efficiently screen panels of diverse heavy chains, designed to allow us to more rapidly identify Biclonics® and Triclonics® therapeutic candidates with differentiated modes of action for pre-clinical and clinical testing. 
 
Using our Biclonics® platform we have produced, and are currently developing, the following candidates: MCLA-128 (zenocutuzumab) for the potential treatment of solid tumors that harbor Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusions; MCLA-158 for the potential treatment of solid tumors; and MCLA-145, developed in collaboration with Incyte Corporation, for the potential treatment of solid tumors. In 2021, we are planning to commence a clinical trial in the United States for MCLA-129, for the potential treatment of solid tumors, which is also the subject to collaboration and license agreement, which permits Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta) to exclusively develop MCLA-129 in China, while Merus retains full ex-China rights. Furthermore, we have a pipeline of proprietary antibody candidates in pre-clinical development and intend to further leverage our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms to identify multiple additional antibody candidates and advance them to clinical development. 
 
Our Strategy 
 
Our goal is to become a leading oncology company developing innovative multispecific antibodies to treat various types of cancer. Our business strategy comprises the following components:

• | Successfully develop our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, for the treatment of NRG1 fusion solid tumors. We are developing our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, for the potential treatment of solid tumors that contain NRG1 gene fusions. The NRG1 protein is the ligand for the HER3 receptor—a known cause of cancer cell growth. The gene encoding NRG1 can form genetic rearrangements referred to as NRG1 gene fusions. The protein product of the NRG1 gene fusion can drive signaling through the HER3 receptor and thus drive cancer cell growth. NRG1 gene fusions occur infrequently in a wide range of different cancer types. Zenocutuzumab has been shown pre-clinically to potently disrupt binding of NRG1 (and NRG1-fusion proteins) to HER3 and halt NRG1-stimulated tumor cell growth. In October 2019, we reported on the 9 patients with NRG1 gene fusion cancers who had received zenocutuzumab as of that date, either while participating in the clinical trial or in connection with an Early Access Program (EAP), including, for several patients, clinical responses and stable disease with tumor reduction and reductions in serum tumor markers. We expect to present data from our Phase 1/2 NRG1 fusion-positive solid tumor trial, eNRGy, at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021. We believe that if zenocutuzumab is successfully developed and obtains regulatory approval, it has the potential to address an important unmet medical need that is not currently being met by existing therapies. In July 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted zenocutuzumab Orphan Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer and in January 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to zenocutuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions that have progressed on standard-of-care therapy.

• | Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-158. We are developing MCLA-158 for a potential dual EGFR/LRG5 blockade for the treatment of solid tumors. Our Phase 1 clinical trial of MCLA-158 is ongoing in the dose expansion phase. On January 15, 2021, we presented in a poster session interim clinical data from the phase 1 dose escalation of MCLA-158 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2021 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. As of a data cut-off of September 2020, MCLA-158 was administered to 33 patients over 11 dose levels (5-1500 mg, flat dose), a heavily pretreated population with a median of four lines of prior therapy. As of the cut-off date, MCLA-158 was observed to be well tolerated, and no dose limiting toxicities occurred. The recommended Phase 2 dose was established at 1500 mg

administered intravenously once every two weeks. Enrollment of patients with gastro-esophageal and head-and-neck cancers continues at this dose in the expansion phase of the open-label, multicenter trial, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity has been observed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-145. We are developing MCLA-145, in collaboration with Incyte Corporation (Incyte), in an ongoing Phase 1 trial for the potential treatment of solid tumors. MCLA-145 is designed to recruit, activate and prevent the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T-cells, and we believe has the potential to avoid the known side effects experienced with CD137 agonists that have been tested in the clinic. We plan to present a clinical update at a major medical conference in the second half of 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-129. We are developing MCLA-129, in collaboration with Betta, and are planning to commence a Phase 1 trial in 2021 to investigate MCLA-129 as a potential treatment for solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in October 2019 pre-clinical data showing that MCLA-129 inhibited tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant NSCLC in pre-clinical xenograft mouse models. We plan to dose the first patient in a clinical trial in the US in 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate the discovery and development of additional internal and collaboration-related bispecific antibody candidates and internal trispecific antibody candidates. We believe we are well positioned to expand our pipeline of Biclonics® and Triclonics® molecules for the potential treatment of cancer and potentially other forms of disease. We are conducting pre-clinical studies for our internal proprietary bispecific and trispecific pipeline as well as leveraging our bispecific platform with our collaborators including Incyte, Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly), Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (Simcere), and Betta.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek strategic collaborations. We intend to seek strategic collaborations to facilitate the capital-efficient development of our pipeline and to maximize the value of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms and to access unique partner capabilities and capacity. We have entered into collaborations with Incyte, Eli Lilly, Simcere, and Betta to develop bispecific antibody candidates based on our Biclonics® technology platform. We plan to work with other potential future collaborators to further validate and expand the use of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms in developing bispecific and trispecific antibody candidates. We have also worked with ONO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., under a research license agreement to generate bispecific antibodies for indications outside oncology, which further underscore the breadth of the Merus platform. We believe these collaborations, license and future agreements could potentially provide significant funding to advance our pipeline and allow us to benefit from the additional resources, development and commercialization expertise of our collaborators.

Our Biclonics® and Triclonics® Candidate Portfolio 
 
We currently have bispecific candidates in clinical development, with a variety bispecific and trispecific candidates in pre-clinical development. The following table summarizes our development candidate pipeline: 
Cancer Immunotherapeutics 
 
Immunotherapy is relatively a new class of cancer treatment that works to harness a patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells. There are a number of immunotherapies that are designed to engage various aspects of the immune system, for example: (1) adaptive immunity, specifically directing genetically modified T cells to the tumor with chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T cells or T-cell receptor modification; or modulating T-cell activity through co-stimulation or checkpoint signals; (2) innate immunity, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cellular-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), monocyte/macrophage cytotoxicity, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, or other forms of T-cell cytotoxicity; all directed at the cancer cells. While these therapies vary in mechanism of action, they rely on specific components of the innate or adaptive immune system to kill tumor cells or counteract signals produced by cancer cells that suppress immune responses.
 
While these approaches have advanced the field of oncology, each also have limitations. For example, the enhanced ADCC of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a single target expressed by tumor cells can potentially induce an autoimmune “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity to normal non-tumor tissues that may also express the same target antigen. Cell-based therapies such as genetically modified CAR-T cells can be difficult and expensive to manufacture, can persist in patients for many months, can be associated with a toxic cytokine release syndrome as safety concerns, or can become ineffective if the tumor loses expression of the single antigen against which the CAR-T cells are directed. We believe bispecific and trispecific antibody candidates developed from our novel platforms offer the potential to overcome these limitations.
 
Background on Antibodies 
 
The conventional antibody in full length immunoglobulin G (IgG) format is a Y-shaped molecule that consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, as shown in the figure below. Each heavy chain pairs with the light chain to form two variable regions, or antigen binding fragment, Fab, that bind to antigens, or targets, and a constant region, which includes a region known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) that binds to receptors present on effector cells in the immune system. In conventional full-length IgG, the variable regions are identical and bind to the same targets.
 
5




In bispecific antibodies, the two variable regions bind to two different targets. To achieve this in the full-length IgG format, two different heavy chain variable regions that can both use a common light chain are combined. In addition, modifications of the heavy chain Fc regions are engineered to drive the formation of full-length IgG that use two different heavy chains rather that two copies of the same heavy chain, which make a monospecific antibody.
 
In both conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and IgG bispecific antibodies, the Fc region can bind to Fc receptors present on effector cells. This binding results in the recruitment and activation of immune effector cells and amplifies the immune system’s response to antigens bound by the variable region of the antibody. This process is called ADCC. The Fc region can be modified to enhance ADCC so as to generate a more potent immune response against a particular target. The Fc region can also be silenced to block interactions with the immune system.
 
Our Biclonics® and Triclonics® Platforms 
 
Our two technology platforms use large-scale functional screening in molecular and cell-based assays to identify novel, innovative Biclonics® and Triclonics® with the specific characteristics desired for further development.
 
We believe our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms allow us to approach cancer treatment through multiple innovative modes of action:
 
 
• | Blocking oncogenic growth factor signaling by disrupting the signaling pathways that drive tumor cell growth or resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy. This includes, for example tumor cell growth driven by NRG1 fusions interacting with the HER3 receptor. Hard-to-target receptors that may drive tumor growth or escape can be targeted by our Dock and Block® mechanism whereby the binding a tumor associated target prevalent on cancer cells facilitates a second domain to bind and block lesser expressed targets that are critical for cancer growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engaging an adaptive immune response by recruiting T-cells and/or modulating co-stimulation or checkpoint inhibition. We can produce multispecific antibodies that are designed to simultaneously bind to the T-cell antigen CD3 or other effector cell engaging antigens, and/or tumor-associated targets, for a potentially potent T cell or other effector cell recruitment and engagement to selectively kill tumor cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engaging the innate immune response through multiple mechanisms. We can produce enhanced ADCC modifications in the Fc region of our Biclonics® or Triclonics® designed to facilitate the recruitment of immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells, or NK cells, and macrophages, to directly kill tumor cells. Specific binding domains engineered in multispecific antibodies can directly bind to macrophages and monocytes; NK cells, each providing specific immune cell function to attack cancer cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employing combinations of the above mechanisms. Using our platforms, we can design antibodies to simultaneously target a growth factor receptor expressed by tumor cells and an immunomodulatory molecule involved in blocking and/or reactivating tumor-specific T cells. Biclonics® and Triclonics® can be designed to target growth factor receptors, like epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and HER2 that are expressed on many tumors, while delivering an activation signal or checkpoint blockade to T cells.

Our process to select lead Biclonics® for clinical development is illustrated below. We use our patented MeMo® and Spleen to Screen® human antibody generation and Biclonics® production technologies to rapidly build large collections of Biclonics® or Triclonics® directed against particular target combinations. We then test these collections in cell-based functional assays to identify multispecific antibodies that have the potential for novel and innovative modes of action. We select the most potent or efficacious and evaluate them in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays to identify lead candidates for clinical development. 
 
Selection of Lead Biclonics®




Our Biclonics® technology platform includes the following:
 
Human antibody generation. Our platform for generating human antibodies employs our patented transgenic murine technology, which we refer to as MeMo®, which harbors human heavy chain variable regions and a human common light chain in its germline. MeMo® harnesses the power of the in vivo immune system to yield human antibodies with the potential for high affinity, specificity, optimal biophysical characteristics and low immunogenicity. Upon immunization, MeMo® is capable of generating large and diverse panels of human common light chain antibodies against a broad variety of targets. These human common light chain antibodies are then used to generate large and diverse panels of Biclonics®, human multispecific antibodies capable of binding different targets of virtually any combination.
  
• | Patented dimerization technology and the full-length Immunoglobulin G format. Our Biclonics® consist of two different heavy chains that need to stably form, or heterodimerize, inside a manufacturing cell line. Using our patented dimerization technology, we employ amino acid residues with opposite charges in the CH3 domains of these heavy chains to efficiently drive the formation of the heterodimer bispecific antibody rather than the homodimer antibody consisting of two copies of the same heavy chain. In addition, the use of a single, or common, light chain in our human Biclonics® antibodies ensures that each heavy chain pairs with the correct, common light chain to efficiently form the intended functional antigen binding regions. The combination of these approaches prevents the need for additional, more artificial techniques, such as the use of linkers or chemical reactions, to force the pairing of different parts of the bispecific antibody. In addition, the format is designed to retain favorable attributes of conventional human IgG mAbs, including their stability and predictability during manufacturing as well as their long half-life and low immunogenicity during treatment of patients. The resulting Biclonics® are bispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies that are designed to closely mimic IgG antibodies that are produced naturally by the immune system.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Biclonics® format also permits us to make modifications to the Fc region of the IgG antibody in order to enhance or limit effector functions associated with this part of the molecule. This strategy has been successfully executed with conventional therapeutic mAbs. In order to enhance efficacy and promote immunotherapeutic activity, we can use glycoengineered cell lines used in production to generate Biclonics® that are enhanced for ADCC, resulting in the improved ability to recruit NK cells and macrophages. This ADCC enhancement has been made to our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, and other of our antibody candidates, MCLA-158 and MCLA-129. In order to improve safety and tolerability, we can modify our Biclonics® to prevent the excessive release of signaling proteins called cytokines, which can overstimulate the immune system. This process is called Fc-silencing as it blocks the ability of our Biclonics® to bind to certain protein receptors on cells, known as Fc receptors, which are associated with cytokine release. We utilize Fc silencing in the design of our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-145.

• | High-throughput functional screening. We employ our patented Spleen to Screen® technology to rapidly screen panels of new target-specific heavy chains that form common light chain binding domains, or we employ our already established panels of common light chain antibodies. To date we have discovered over 10,000 unique common light chain antibodies directed at more than 40 different antigens, including tumor-associated antigens such as EGFR and cMET; T-cell binding, stimulating or co-stimulating proteins such as CD3 and CD137 (also called 4-1BB); and other immune-cell engaging antigens. For example, we have an established a panel of more than 175 unique and novel anti-CD3 common light chain antibodies from which to discover and develop the next generation of T-cell engaging bispecific and trispecific antibodies. We then generate DNA constructs that encode target-specific human antibodies and express them in mammalian cells. The common light chain format and proprietary dimerization modifications to the CH3 domain of the IgG promote the secretion of virtually pure Biclonics® into the cell culture medium. The medium of thousands of cell cultures that each express a different Biclonics® is harvested and individually used in high throughput molecular and cell-based functional assays to identify Biclonics® with specific novel characteristics for further development.

For example, the chart below shows the results of a pre-clinical study in which hundreds of different Biclonics® targeting HER2 and HER3 were functionally screened for cell growth inhibition of tumor cell samples in the presence or absence of the HER3 ligand NRG1. Forty of the Biclonics® depicted in the chart exhibited superior inhibition of cell growth compared to trastuzumab, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of breast cancer, and were selected in the process leading to identification of zenocutuzumab. 
 

Advantages of Biclonics®

We believe our Biclonics® technology platform provides the following advantages:
 
 
• | Rapid generation of human IgG antibodies having diversity at the heavy chain targeting an array of antigens, that are ready to be paired to produce our Biclonics®, bispecific antibodies. Use of our patented MeMo®, Spleen to Screen®, heterodimerization and Fc modification technologies, permits us to rapidly generate a large amount of diverse bispecific antibodies capable of targeting an array of antigen combinations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biclonics® are stable, bispecific, full-length human IgG antibodies with no linkers or fusion proteins. Biclonics® retain the IgG format of antibodies that are produced naturally by the immune system. Additionally, in contrast to many other bispecific antibody formats, Biclonics® do not require linkers or modifications to force the correct pairing of heavy and light chain variable regions or exploit fusion proteins to add functionality to the molecule. These qualities minimize time-consuming engineering efforts and allow us to create Biclonics® with predictable behavior during pre-clinical development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Biclonics® technology platform allows for functional evaluation of Biclonics® in the relevant therapeutic format leading to the discovery of therapeutic candidates with novel and innovative properties. Our Biclonics® technology platform permits rapid functional screening of large collections of bispecific antibodies which allows us to identify lead candidates with multiple mechanisms of action that have the potential to effectively kill tumor cells with high potency. This is an important step in the identification of lead bispecific antibody candidates with functionalities that compare favorably against other forms of therapeutics, such as conventional mAbs as well as their combinations.

• | Biclonics® preserve the stability, behavior and adaptability of normal IgG antibodies. Biclonics® are based on the robust and commonly used IgG format to yield the favorable in vivo qualities associated with conventional mAbs, such as stability, long half-life and low immunogenicity. As a result, our Biclonics® format provides attractive options for dosage schedules and methods of administration, rendering them compatible with multiple modes of action for the efficient killing of tumor cells. Further, the IgG format allows us to apply previously established technologies to further optimize our Biclonics® for therapeutic use.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biclonics® can be reliably manufactured with high yields. Because our Biclonics® retain the IgG format of antibodies, our Biclonics® are manufactured using the large-scale industry-standard processes that are also used for the production of conventional mAbs, and the yields of Biclonics® we obtain are comparable to those of normal IgG antibodies. In stable cell lines, we are able to obtain over 90% of bispecific antibody formation using these processes and the IgG-based purification process results in up to greater than 98% purity for our Biclonics®.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Triclonics® Platform 
 
Our next generation proprietary Triclonics® technology is covered by existing Merus patents and other pending applications. This new format and the suite of technologies that underpin it permit the development of therapeutic candidates designed to bind three targets with a single multivalent molecule. In pre-clinical studies and modeling, Triclonics® have shown similar qualities of a natural IgG antibody, including favorable half-life, stability, low immunogenicity and favorable developability characteristics. We believe Triclonics® have the potential to produce tumor cell-killing activity and/or to modulate the immune system to promote more robust anti-tumor immune responses, and have the potential for less on-target off-tumor toxicity. This format allows us to leverage our proprietary genetically modified MeMo® mice, which as described above, harbors human heavy chain variable region gene segments and a human common light chain in its germline. MeMo® harnesses the power of the in vivo immune system to yield human antibodies with the potential for high affinity, specificity, optimal biophysical characteristics and low immunogenicity, which can be combined into a single trispecific antibody produced with relative high purity. The Triclonics® platform employs our proprietary technologies to produce large panels of substantially pure trispecific antibodies. In addition, we have engineered a panel of novel linkers that attach a third binding domain to the antibody. This panel of linkers vary in properties such as length and flexibility, and are empirically selected for stability and other drug-like properties, while remaining stable and are predicted to have low immunogenicity. The linker panel provides another lever of flexibility in optimizing functional characteristics in our high-throughput screening while maintaining high quality, stability and limiting risk of immunogenicity.

One application of the Triclonics® platform is as a T-cell engager for solid tumors. By binding to three targets, we can generate Triclonics® designed to specifically engage a combination of two tumor antigens for enhanced specificity, binding preferentially to tumor cells expressing both antigens, over normal tissues that may express either antigen, but not both or both at lower expression levels. In this construct, the third binding domain can for example engage an innate or adaptive immune effector cell protein, to stimulate killing of the tumor cell. We believe our Triclonics® platform will permit us to develop molecules with enhanced on target, on tumor specificity, while optimally engaging the immune system mechanisms.
 

Our process to select lead Triclonics® leverages our patented MeMo® and Spleen to Screen® human antibody generation and heterodimerization technologies, along with our proprietary linkers based on natural structures to undertake high throughput unbiased functional screening of Triclonics®. With this approach, we have been able to evaluate up to 1,800 different trispecific antibodies targeting three different antigens to identify those unique combinations that pre-clinically have been observed to have desired characteristics for further development. 
 
Our Bispecific and Trispecific Antibody Candidate Portfolio 
 
We currently have four bispecific antibody candidates in clinical development, with additional bispecific and trispecific programs in pre-clinical development. 
 
Zenocutuzumab (MCLA-128, HER3 x HER2 Biclonics®)
 
Zenocutuzumab is an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) -enhanced Biclonics® that utilizes Merus’ Dock & Block® mechanism to bind to HER2, and bind to and disrupt the interaction between HER3 and ligand, NRG1, in solid tumors. HER2, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is amplified in many solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis, and the activation of HER3, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 3, is associated with tumor progression and treatment resistance. On the surface of tumor cells, HER2 pairs, or dimerizes, with HER3, and the resulting pair drives malignant progression of HER2-expressing cancer cells. NRG1, which is the ligand for HER3, causes cancer cells to grow and become resistant to treatment with HER2-targeted therapies. Zenocutuzumab is believed to target the HER3 signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction of Her3 with its ligand NRG1 and to overcome the resistance of tumor cells to HER2-targeted therapies using two mechanisms: blocking growth and survival pathways to stop tumor expansion and recruitment, and ADCC enhanced elimination of the tumor via effector cells. In addition, we have identified a rare, genetically defined patient population whose cancers harbor NRG1 fusions. The NRG1 gene encodes for neuregulin, the ligand for HER3. Fusions between NRG1 and other genes in the genome are rare genetic events occurring in lung, pancreatic and other solid tumors, and are associated with activation of HER2/HER3 signaling and growth of cancer cells. Overall estimates of the incidence of NRG1 fusions’ occurrence are based on limited published information. Based on available literature, we estimate NRG1 fusions occur at a rate of approximately 0.3% – 3.0% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 0.5% - 1.5% in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and less than 1% in all other tumor types. Importantly, we believe NRG1 fusions occur more frequently in the invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma subtype of lung cancer, and in the subset of patients with PDAC lacking a mutation in the K-RAS gene. The NRG1 fusion is a powerful driver of cancer cell growth. We believe that pre-clinical studies and early clinical evaluation suggest zenocutuzumab (binding to HER2 and blocking NRG1 fusion protein interaction with HER3) has the potential to be particularly effective against tumors harboring NRG1 fusions.

Development
 
In our pre-clinical studies, the administration of zenocutuzumab resulted in the inhibition of NRG-induced growth in cultures of cancer cells. Zenocutuzumab also blocked activation of two key signaling pathways for the growth and survival of tumor cells more than Herceptin (trastuzumab) or the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta (pertuzumab) (shown in red below) or experimental anti-HER3 mAbs (shown in green below). See Geuijen et al. Cancer Cell (2018). 
 

* indicates analog antibodies.
 
In a patient-derived tumor xenograph mouse model (PDX model) zenocutuzumab significantly blocked tumor growth of a cancer containing an NRG1 gene fusion.

Based on encouraging pre-clinical results, we initiated a Phase 1/2 study of zenocutuzumab in solid tumors. As of January 2019, zenocutuzumab administered as a single-agent had been evaluated in 117 patients, who received the recommended Phase 2 doses. Zenocutuzumab was well-tolerated as a single agent, with low observed immunogenicity, and most reported adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate. Also as of January 2019, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 AEs irrespective of causality was 37% and 3%, respectively, with the incidence of suspected drug-related grade 3 AEs of about 4%, no suspected drug-related grade 4 adverse events, and one patient experienced a grade 5 hypersensitivity reaction. 
 
 
• | NRG1 Fusions
--+-------------

 
In June 2019, we opened a zenocutuzumab EAP and amended the Phase 1/2 trial to focus on patients with solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion (the eNRGy trial). Patients treated under EAP and the protocol amendment receive zenocutuzumab at 750 mg administered intravenously every other week. As of October 27, 2019, nine patients identified with cancers harboring NRG1 fusions (three pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and six NSCLC) who had previously progressed through standard of care, had been enrolled and treated with zenocutuzumab across the EAP under single patient investigational new drug applications, and the eNRGy trial. Of the nine patients treated, six had at least one evaluation and thus were considered evaluable.
 
On October 27, 2019, investigators from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) provided an oral presentation at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, in Boston, Massachusetts, entitled “Clinical proof-of-concept for zenocutuzumab, a bispecific HER2/3 antibody therapy, in NRG1 fusion-positive cancers”, reporting a summary and initial data concerning the treatment of three cancer patients harboring NRG1 fusions (NRG1+) with zenocutuzumab at 750 mg administered intravenously every other week. Assessments of these patients were conducted locally at MSKCC. All three patients, two having PDAC and one having NSCLC, exhibited tumor shrinkage, symptomatic improvement and durability up to the then most recent assessment. All three patients remained on treatment as of October 29, 2019. 
 
Of the two patients having PDAC reported by MSKCC on October 27, 2019, one exhibited a 54% reduction in tumor diameter at a confirmatory 5 months scan (partial response (PR) by RECIST v1.1).
 
12



The other PDAC patient exhibited a 25% reduction in tumor diameter at a confirmatory 5 months scan (stable disease (SD) by RECIST v1.1). Both patients remained on treatment for over 7 months as of October 29, 2019.
 
The third patient reported by MSKCC on October 27, 2019 has NSCLC and exhibited a 41% reduction in tumor diameter at a confirmatory scan (PR by RECIST v1.1) and improvement in brain metastases. Prior to zenocutuzumab treatment the patient progressed on six lines of therapy, including the tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib. The patient remained on treatment for approximately 5 months as of October 29, 2019.
 
We also reported that as of October 29, 2019, we had previously treated six additional patients with NRG1+ cancers, one having PDAC and five having NSCLC. The one patient with PDAC, who was enrolled under a single patient IND outside of MSKCC, had received two treatments with zenocutuzumab, at a four-week non-standard interval due to the severity of the patient’s illness, and was non-evaluable, passing away due to complications related to the underlying disease prior to a first tumor evaluation.
 
For the five of these additional six patients, each with NRG1+ NSCLC enrolled in the eNRGy clinical trial that received treatment with zenocutuzumab, one patient had SD for greater than 7 months but discontinued the trial due to poor adherence to the treatment protocol (unrelated to any AE or lack of efficacy); two patients had progressive disease and are no longer on the trial; and two patients as of October 29, 2019, had only recently started treatment and had not yet undergone initial assessment for tumor response.
 
We reported in October 2019 that the safety results observed for zenocutuzumab in patients with cancers harboring NRG1 gene fusions was observed to be well tolerated, consistent with what has been previously reported in the overall patient population treated with zenocutuzumab.
 
We are currently enrolling patients for the Phase 1/2 eNRGy trial to assess the anti-tumor activity of monotherapy zenocutuzumab in NRG1+ cancers. The eNRGy trial enrolls patients with NRG1+ pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Enrolled patients will receive 750mg of zenocutuzumab every two weeks. We expect to present data at a medical conference in the second quarter of 2021. In January of 2021 the FDA granted Fast Track designation of zenocutuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions that have progressed on standard-of-care therapy.
 
 
• | Her2 Amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC)
--+----------------------------------------------

 
In May 2020, we announced that we had completed enrollment of a Phase 2 trial of zenocutuzumab (zeno) in metastatic breast cancer, and would be presenting data at Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program. These data presented at that program showed that zeno in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine was active in heavily pretreated HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed on multiple lines of anti-HER2 therapies and that zeno was well tolerated. With a safety cut-off (sample size 28) of November 2019, and an efficacy data cut-off (sample size 39) of March 31, 2020, 39 patients were treated with the triplet combination – among the 39 patients, 12 were ongoing on study treatment, and the median numbers of prior therapies and prior anti-HER2 lines were 5 and 3, respectively. The most common severe adverse event (AE) reported with the triplet therapy was neutropenia considered related to vinorelbine, with few patients discontinuing due to AEs. As of March 31, 2020, anti-tumor activity was evaluated in 37 evaluable patients with locally confirmed Her2 amplification (3+ immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ IHC confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)) with a the clinical benefit rate (compete response (CR)+ partial response (PR)+ [stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks]) of 35.1% [90%CI 22.2-50.0], with one patent having a CR lasting 19.3 weeks, 6 patients having a PR (lasting from 5.3+ to 12.3 weeks), and 22 having SD (lasting from 5.9+ to 59.1+ weeks).  As of the efficacy cut-off, among those with a best response of SD, 5 patients had an unconfirmed PR, 2 of which were 
 13

ongoing as of the presentation. Currently, certain patients remain on treatment in the Phase 2 trial. We plan to present data from the Phase 2 trial in a future medical conference when the studies are completed.
 
In October 2019, we previously disclosed that we plan to advance development in metastatic breast cancer only with a partner and intend to focus our efforts on the eNRGy trial of zeno in NRG1 fusion cancers.
 
MCLA-158 (Lgr5 x EGFR Biclonics®)
 
MCLA-158 is an investigational antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enhanced Biclonics® for the potential treatment of solid tumors that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Lgr5 is a WNT target gene expressed in cancer cells with aberrations in the WNT signaling pathway, while EGFR is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is important for growth and survival of cancer stem cells, including those with RAS mutations. MCLA-158 is designed to use two different mechanisms of action. The first is intended to block growth and survival pathways in cancer stem cells. The second involves the recruitment and enhancement of immune effector cells in an effort to directly kill cancer stem cells that persist in solid tumors and cause relapse and metastasis.
 
Development
 
In our pre-clinical studies, MCLA-158 demonstrated superior growth inhibition and selectivity versus the EGFR-targeting mAb, cetuximab. MCLA-158 was significantly more potent than cetuximab in inhibiting the growth of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. Additionally, MCLA-158 was observed to be selectively more active in human tumor-derived organoids than in organoids derived from normal human colon. The activity of MCLA-158 on the tumor organoid size was more than 100 times greater than on the normal colon organoids. In contrast, the activity of cetuximab was similar to the activity of MCLA-158 on normal colon organoids and 20 to 100 times less than the activity of MCLA-158 on tumor organoids. These ex-vivo observations of MCLA-158 with organoid models were further observed in vivo in xenograft models generated from the same patient-derived organoids.

MCLA-158 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study, currently in the expansion phase, in patients with solid tumors. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of the defined dose; secondary endpoints include single-agent preliminary anti-tumor activity. On January 15, 2021, we presented in a poster session interim clinical data from our Phase 1 dose escalation of MCLA-158 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2021 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. As of a data cut-off of September 2020, MCLA-158 was administered to 33 patients over 11 dose levels (5-1500 mg, flat dose), a heavily pretreated population with a median of four lines of prior therapy. As of the cut-off date, MCLA-158 was observed to be well tolerated, and no dose limiting toxicities occurred. The recommended Phase 2 dose was established at 1500 mg administered intravenously once every two weeks. Enrollment of patients with gastro-esophageal and head-and-neck cancers continues at this dose in the expansion phase of the open-label, multicenter trial, and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity has been observed.

MCLA-145 (CD137 x PD-L1 Biclonics®)
 
MCLA-145 is a Biclonics® T-cell engager that binds to human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD137. MCLA-145 is designed to recruit, activate and prevent the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells, and to cause a potent and durable T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. MCLA-145’s binding to a cell is predicted to lead to clustering of CD137 on T cells when PD-L1 is expressed on adjacent cells, and block the T-cell inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in the tumor. Because T-cell activation in our pre-clinical studies was shown to be context-dependent, requiring PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment, we believe MCLA-145 has the potential to overcome the known side effects experienced with CD137 agonists that have been tested in the clinic
 
MCLA-145 is the first drug candidate co-developed under our global research and collaboration with Incyte Corporation (Incyte), which permits the development and commercialization of up to 11 bispecific and monospecific antibodies from our Biclonics® platform. Under the terms of the collaboration, Merus retains all rights to develop and commercialize MCLA-145, if approved, in the United States, while Incyte has rights to develop and commercialize MCLA-145, if approved, outside the United States.  We plan to present a clinical update on MCLA-145 at a major medical conference in the second half of 2021.
 
Development
 
In our pre-clinical studies, MCLA-145 showed binding to PD-L1 and CD137, recruitment of T cells into the tumor, blocking of inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 axis and potent T-cell activation. 
 


Further, MCLA-145 demonstrated superior tumor cell killing as compared to the administration of a combination of monospecific anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD137 antibodies in PDX models.

In May 2019, we commenced a Phase 1 open-label, single-agent clinical trial of MCLA-145, consisting of dose escalation followed by dose expansion, for the potential treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 trial are dose finding and evaluation of safety and tolerability in patients. The trial will also examine potential preliminary antitumor activity and functional target engagement of single-agent MCLA-145.
 
MCLA-129 (EGFR x c-MET Biclonics®)
 
MCLA-129 is an investigational Biclonics®, designed to bind EGFR and c-MET, for the potential treatment of solid tumors. EGFR is an important oncogenic driver in many cancers. The upregulation of c-MET signaling has been associated with resistance to EGFR inhibition. MCLA-129 has two distinct mechanisms of action. First, MCLA-129 is designed to block the signaling of EGFR as well as c-MET, in an effort to inhibit tumor growth and survival. Second, MCLA-129 utilizes ADCC-enhancement technology, which is designed for greater cell-killing potential. Because both mechanisms of action are dependent on the co-expression of EGFR and c-MET, we believe MCLA-129 has the potential for less toxicity compared to agents targeting EGFR alone. 
 
MCLA-129 is being developed in collaboration with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta). Under the terms of the collaboration, Betta is responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of MCLA-129, if approved, in China and we retain all rights to MCLA-129 outside of China. In January 2021, Betta announced that the Chinese National Medical Products Administration had accepted its IND for MCLA-129 injection. We have also announced we plan to dose the first patient in a clinical trial in the US in 2021.
 
Development
 
Pre-clinical data on MCLA-129 were presented in October 2019, at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. The poster, entitled “Pre-clinical evaluation of MCLA-129: a bispecific antibody targeting c-MET and EGFR,” showed that MCLA-129 inhibited and reversed resistance to tyrosine kinase resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cell lines resulting in tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models of NSCLC. In these xenograft models, MCLA-129 showed tumor shrinkage in mice whose tumors are resistant to the EGFR small molecule inhibitor erlotinib.

MCLA-129 Inhibited TKI Resistant NSCLC  |MCLA-129 Reversed Acquired TKI Resistance
 



These pre-clinical data suggest MCLA-129, if successfully developed and approved, could benefit patients having NSCLC that become resistant to EGFR targeted therapies. 
 
Pre-clinical Discovery Programs
 
We intend to further leverage our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms to identify multiple additional antibody candidates and advance them to clinical development. Each of these antibody candidates are designed to bind to targets believed to be useful in the treatment of cancer with an intention to establish efficacy and obtain information for submission to the FDA. Using our platform, we will continue to evaluate new targets and combinations to identify potential candidates with the highest therapeutic potential and select those candidates to be advanced into clinical trials.
Collaboration Agreements
 
As part of our business strategy, we collaborate with a range of partners, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic companies as well as academic institutions. We intend to continue to seek collaborations and license agreements to develop and commercialize therapeutics in order to exploit the potential of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms. 
 
Incyte Corporation 
 
We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement (Collaboration Agreement) with Incyte Corporation (Incyte). Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Incyte have agreed to collaborate with respect to the research, discovery and development of monospecific or bispecific antibodies utilizing our proprietary Biclonics® technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to 11 independent programs, including some of our current pre-clinical immuno-oncology discovery programs. For one of the current clinical programs, concerning MCLA-145, we retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the product candidate in the United States, while Incyte has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the product candidate outside the United States. For MCLA-145, we and Incyte will conduct and share equally the costs of mutually agreed global development activities and will be solely responsible for independent development activities in our respective territories. 
 
We have the option to co-fund development of products, if any, arising from one specified program, and subject to certain conditions, to a second specified program, in each case in exchange for a share of profits in the United States, as well as the right to participate in a specified proportion of detailing activities in the United States for one of such programs. If we exercise our co-funding option for a program, we would be responsible for funding 35% of the associated future global development costs and, for certain of such programs, would be responsible for reimbursing Incyte for certain development costs incurred prior to the option exercise. All products as to which we have exercised our option to co-fund development would be subject to joint development plans and overseen by a joint development committee, with Incyte having final determination as to such plans in cases of dispute. 
 

For each program other than MCLA-145, where we have not elected to co-fund development or where we do not have such a co-funding option, Incyte is solely responsible for all costs of global development and commercialization activities. We retain the rights 
 17

to, among other things, our Biclonics® technology platform as well as clinical and pre-clinical candidates and future programs emerging from our platform that are outside the scope of the Collaboration Agreement. 
 
In January 2017, upon the Collaboration Agreement becoming effective, Incyte made an upfront non-refundable payment to us of $120 million for the rights granted under the Collaboration Agreement. For each program as to which we do not have commercialization or co-development rights, we are eligible to receive up to $100 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones and up to $250 million in commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of global net sales. For each program as to which we have exercised our option to co-fund development, we are eligible to receive a 50% share of profits (or sustain 50% of any losses) in the United States and tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of net sales of products outside of the United States. If we opt to cease co-funding a program as to which we exercised our co-development option, then we will no longer receive a share of profits in the United States but will be eligible to receive the same milestones from the co-funding termination date and the same tiered royalties described above with respect to non-co-developed programs and, depending on the stage at which we choose to cease co-funding development costs, additional royalties ranging up to 4% of net sales in the United States. For MCLA-145, for which we retain all commercial rights in the United States, we and Incyte are each eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in the other’s territory at rates ranging from 6% to 10%. 
 
The Collaboration Agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until neither party has any royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the Collaboration Agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated in its entirety, or on a program-by-program basis, by Incyte for convenience. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach, or on a program-by-program basis for patent challenge of patents under the applicable program, in each case as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to one or more programs, all rights in the terminated programs revert to us, subject to payment to Incyte of a reverse royalty of up to 4% on sales of future products, if we elect to pursue development and commercialization of products arising from the terminated programs. 
 
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Incyte, pursuant to which, in January 2017, we issued and sold to Incyte 3,200,000 common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $80.0 million. 
 
Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly)
 In 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the “Lilly Collaboration Agreement”) and share subscription agreement (the “Lilly Subscription Agreement”) with Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (“Eli Lilly”).
 Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Eli Lilly agreed to collaborate with respect to the discovery and research of bispecific antibodies utilizing our proprietary Biclonics® bispecific technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to three (3) independent programs directed to the generation of T-cell re-directing bispecific antibodies that bind CD3 and a tumor associated antigen target selected by Eli Lilly (“Target”) to be the subject of each such program.
 We granted to Eli Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights and know-how to exploit certain compounds and products directed to designated Targets in combination with CD3, or directed to such designated Target(s) alone as a monospecific antibody or monospecific antibody drug conjugate, subject to rights granted by us to third parties under one or more existing third party agreements. We also retain all rights not granted to Eli Lilly.
 Additionally, in the case of a change of control that may adversely impact certain rights and obligations of us and Eli Lilly under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, (a) we have agreed to terminate or transfer its rights to third parties under certain research programs and (b) Eli Lilly has the option to take over certain of our research obligations.
 Eli Lilly paid an upfront, non-refundable payment of $40 million for the rights granted under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. Eli Lilly agreed to fund the research and development activities we conduct for each program under an agreed research plan and budget. With respect to each product arising from each program, we are eligible to receive up to $290 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones and up to $250 million in commercial sales milestones, for a total of up to approximately $1.6 billion for a single product generated from all three programs. We are further eligible to receive, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties based on the level of worldwide aggregate annual net sales at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits until the royalty term expires.
 The Lilly Collaboration Agreement includes a three-year research term for us to perform research and development activities, subject to two extension terms of six months at Eli Lilly’s discretion. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis until Eli Lilly has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such product or, if earlier, the termination of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis at will by Eli Lilly. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either us or Eli Lilly under certain other circumstances, including material breach, as set forth in the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. If the Lilly Collaboration Agreement is terminated with respect to one or more programs, depending on the 
 18

stage of development, certain rights in the terminated programs revert to us, in accordance with the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement.
 Also in January 2021, in connection with entering into the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to the Lilly Subscription Agreement, Eli Lilly agreed to purchase 706,834 common shares of the Company at a price per share of $28.295 for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $20 million (the “Private Placement”). Eli Lilly agreed not to transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of the shares purchased in the private placement for a period of time following the closing date, subject to certain customary exceptions.
 ONO Pharmaceutical 
 
In April 2014, we entered into a strategic research and license agreement with ONO, under which we granted ONO an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to research, test, make, use and market a limited set of bispecific antibody candidates, if approved, based on our Biclonics® technology platform, directed to two undisclosed targets.
 
ONO paid us a non-refundable upfront fee of €1.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of €57.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified research and clinical development milestones. To date, we have achieved four of the specified pre-clinical milestones under this research and license agreement and have received an aggregate of €2.7 million in milestone payments. For products commercialized under this agreement, if any, we are also eligible to receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales. For a designated period, which may include limited time periods following termination of this agreement, in certain circumstances we and our affiliates are prohibited from researching, developing or commercializing bispecific antibodies against the target combination that are the subject of this agreement. ONO also provides funding for our research and development activities under an agreed-upon plan. This research and license agreement will expire after all milestone payments have been received and all related patent rights have expired, unless terminated earlier. ONO has the right to terminate this agreement at any time for any reason, with or without cause. The licenses granted to ONO may convert to royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual licenses if ONO terminates the agreement for uncured material breach. We retain all rights to use and commercialize any antibodies directed to one target utilized under the collaborative research program, and any antibodies directed to the second target developed under the collaborative research program, excluding the up to five lead and/or selected antibodies against the second target ONO is pursuing, provided that the use and commercialization is not with respect to the particular target combination.
 
On March 14, 2018, we entered into a second contract research and license agreement with ONO. Pursuant to an exclusive option granted to ONO in the prior agreement executed in April 2014, ONO exercised its option to enter into the March 2018 agreement. We granted ONO an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, research, test, make, use and market bispecific antibody candidates based on our Biclonics® technology platform against two undisclosed targets directed to a particular undisclosed target combination. ONO identifies and selects the licensed bispecific antibodies for which it is responsible for conducting further non-clinical and clinical development activities for such licensed bispecific antibodies and pharmaceutical products containing such antibodies, including manufacture and process development. ONO controls and has exclusive rights over the worldwide commercialization of any approved products, including worldwide supply, and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to commercialization. ONO has agreed to fund our research and development activities and be responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses for its own research and development activities, which are set out in a mutually agreed upon research plan. We retain all rights to use and commercialize any antibodies that are generated under the collaborative research program, excluding the up to five lead and/or selected antibodies against the targets ONO is pursuing, provided that the use and commercialization is not with respect to the particular target combination.
 
ONO has agreed to pay an upfront non-refundable payment of €700,000 for the rights granted and we are also eligible to receive an aggregate of €57.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified research and clinical development milestones. To date, we have achieved four of the specified pre-clinical milestones under this research and license agreement and have received an aggregate of €3.7 million in milestone payments. For products commercialized under the License Agreement, if any, the Company is eligible to receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales. 
 
For a designated period, which may include limited time periods following termination of this agreement, in certain circumstances we are prohibited from researching, developing or commercializing bispecific antibodies against the undisclosed target combination that are the subject of this agreement. ONO also provides funding for our research and development activities under an agreed-upon plan. This research and license agreement will expire after all milestone payments have been received and all related patent rights have expired, unless terminated earlier. ONO has the right to terminate this agreement at any time for any reason, with or without cause. The licenses granted to ONO may convert to royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual licenses if ONO terminates the agreement for uncured material breach.
 
Simcere Pharmaceutical Group 
 
On January 8, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (Simcere) granting Simcere an exclusive license to develop and commercialize in China up to three bispecific antibodies to be produced by Merus utilizing our proprietary Biclonics® technology platform. We retain all rights outside of China.
 
19


We have agreed to lead research and discovery activities while Simcere has agreed to be responsible for the IND-enabling studies, clinical development, regulatory filings and commercialization of these product candidates in China. Under the terms of the agreement, for a program achieving development candidate nomination, Simcere will retain a contract manufacturing organization with experience in filing IND applications with U.S. authorities and clinical trial agreements (CTAs) with European regulatory authorities in order to produce clinical trial materials. We received an upfront payment, and are eligible to receive milestone payments contingent upon Simcere achieving certain specified development and commercial goals. To date, we have achieved two undisclosed milestone payments under this agreement. We are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in China from Simcere. Simcere is eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on sales outside of China from us. 
 
Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. 
 
On December 10, 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta) where we granted Betta an exclusive license to develop and commercialize in China MCLA-129, a Merus proprietary Biclonics® produced by our Biclonics® technology platform. We retain all rights outside of China. Under the terms of the agreement, Betta retained a contract manufacturing organization with experience in filing IND applications with U.S. authorities and CTAs with European regulatory authorities in order to produce clinical trial materials for the Chinese market and the rest of the world. 
 
In addition to a non-refundable upfront payment, we and Betta will share equally the cost of the transfer of the manufacturing technology to a contract manufacturing organization. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments contingent upon Betta achieving certain specified development and commercial goals as well as tiered royalty payments of net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in China. Betta is eligible to receive milestone payments contingent upon us achieving certain specified development and commercial goals, and is eligible to receive tiered royalty payments of net sales outside of China. 
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our Biclonics® technology platform relies on third parties for biological materials. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for the supply of current good manufacturing practice-grade (cGMP-grade) clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of our antibody candidates and products, if approved. We currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of product candidates, but we have contracted several biopharmaceutical CMOs for the clinical manufacture of zenocutuzumab, MCLA-158, MCLA-145, and MCLA-129. We believe that the standardized Biclonics® manufacturing process can be transferred to additional CMOs and potential future co-development or co-commercialization collaborations or partnerships for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of our Biclonics® in the ordinary course of business. 
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for zenocutuzumab, MCLA-158, MCLA-145, MCLA-129 or any of our other antibody candidates because our antibody candidates are still in pre-clinical or early-to-middle-stage clinical development. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval, if any, for one of our antibody candidates. 
Competition
 
We compete directly with companies that focus on oncology and companies dedicating their resources to cancer therapies. We also face competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and other various public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available and new therapeutic candidates are clinically developed or approved therapies are explored for new indications. Any antibody candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, manufacturer’s production capacity, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
20


The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic antibody candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if our antibody candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
 
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer, including other bispecific antibodies or similar molecules. Our closest competitors in this area include Affimed N.V., Zymeworks Inc., Genmab A/S, EpimAb Biotherapeutics, MacroGenics, Inc., NuMab Therapeutics, Elevation Oncology, Rain Therapeutics, Hummingbird Bioscience, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Xencor, Inc. The antibody candidates in development by competitors may provide efficacy, safety, dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our antibody candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and antibody candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. 
As of January 31, 2021:

We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary positions.
 
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. For important factors related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and antibody candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive regulation. We expect our antibody candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
 
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
 
• | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, and pre-clinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices (GLPs);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practice (GCP), regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22


 
• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Before testing any antibody candidate in humans, the antibody candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical trials, generally include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the antibody candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds, at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological antibody candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 
 
• | Phase 1. The biological antibody candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological antibody candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being 
 23

exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological antibody candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological antibody candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the biological antibody candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological antibody candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological antibody candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological antibody candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological antibody candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. 
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. 
 24

Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from the filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our antibody candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious disease or condition, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Biological products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required 
 25

post-market clinical trials or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 
In addition, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) enacted in 2012, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same antibody candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
 
Fast Track designation, priority review and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one of these designations for our antibody candidates, the FDA may later decide that our antibody candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers of approved biologics are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, and reporting updated safety and efficacy information. 
 
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approve biosimilars. 
 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes 
 26

by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. Certain aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty. 
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
We expect that our antibody candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (PMA) approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for use with our antibody candidates may utilize the PMA pathway.
 
If use of a companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “ In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our antibody candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate may be required to be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling, although the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve a therapeutic product even though a companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared contemporaneously. In general, the FDA expects that a companion diagnostic that is intended for use with the therapeutic product will be later approved or cleared through an appropriate submission and the therapeutic product labeling will be revised to stipulate the use of the companion diagnostic. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products, and in December 2018, the FDA issued a draft guidance describing considerations for the development and labeling of in vitro companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products. 
 
The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and 
 27

labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 
If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trials or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. 
 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Clinical Trials
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Economic Area (EEA) (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the Ethics Committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant Member State(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), guidelines on Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a CTA from the Competent Authority, and a positive opinion from an independent Ethics Committee. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation.  
 28

Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the Competent Authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted.  Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect by early 2022, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement.  Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs.  Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorizations
 In the EEA, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product in the EEA, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EEA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA which is valid across the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days.  This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.  At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission.  If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA.  
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national Competent Authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
 In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the CHMP before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EEA also provides opportunities for market exclusivity.  For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EEA from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EEA’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 
 29

Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. During this period, the EMA cannot accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA for the same indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EEA for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the MA is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
  
• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the Member States. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.  
 
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited.  Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EEA. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 
Failure to comply with EU and Member State laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 
Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
In the EEA, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are regulated by Directive 98/79/EC which regulates the placing on the market, the CE-marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufactures and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices must comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be). 
 
30


Companion diagnostics can also be considered “combination products” which are governed by a different regulatory pathway depending on the mode of action of the products. A combination medicine/device product could either be regulated as a medicinal product or a medical device based on its primary mode of action. In principle, if a medical device incorporates a substance which, if used separately, is likely to be considered as a medicinal product and act on the human body by an action ancillary to that of the device, the device must be evaluated and authorized in accordance with the medical device regulations. However, if the medicinal substance constitutes the main function of the product then the product is considered as a medicinal product. Currently, for such combination products, the manufacturer will have to consult, prior to obtaining the CE marking of the device, the EMA or national Competent Authorities to obtain scientific advice on the quality and safety of the medicinal substance, including the benefit/risk profile of its incorporation into the device.
 
The regulation of companion diagnostics will be subject to further requirements as of the entry into force of the in-vitro diagnostic devices Regulation (No 2017/746) which introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a marketing authorization application for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national Competent Authorities or the EMA.
 
With respect to the United Kingdom, the transition period, during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the United Kingdom, has expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which is provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021. 
 The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. 
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 
The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, a 
 31

claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved ( e.g. , off-label) uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined by statute, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of pricing and marketing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. We are not currently a covered manufacturer under the ACA, but may become one if successful in obtaining approval of one of our antibody candidates.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. By way of example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective January 1, 2020, which gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), recently passed in California. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023.
 
32


If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement, and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 
To the extent that any of our antibody candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 
Privacy and Data Protection Laws in Europe 
 
We are subject to European laws relating to our and our suppliers’, collaborators’ and subcontractors’ (where they act as processors) collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., any data relating to an identifiable living individual, whether that individual can be identified directly or indirectly). We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established, and where we process personal data in the context of the activities of that establishment (e.g., undertaking clinical trials). We and our suppliers, collaborators and subcontractors process personal data including in relation to our employees, employees of customers, clinical trial patients, healthcare professionals and employees of suppliers including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and national laws and regulations implementing or supplementing it. 
 
The GDPR requires that personal data is only collected for specified, explicit and legal purposes as set out in the GDPR or local laws, and the data may then only be processed in a manner compatible with those purposes. The personal data collected and processed must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, it must be held securely, not transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection, and must not be retained for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. In addition, the GDPR requires companies processing personal data to take certain organizational steps to ensure that they have adequate records, policies, security, training and governance frameworks in place to ensure, and to be able to demonstrate, protection. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, may require the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a sufficiently large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification throughout the EU and imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with certain service providers. 
 
In addition, to the extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses “special category” personal data (including patients’ health or medical information, genetic information and biometric information), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner in which a company is legally permitted to process that data. The GDPR provides a broad right for EU and EEA member states to create supplemental national laws which may result in divergence across Europe making it harder to maintain a consistent operating model or standard operating procedures. Such laws, for example, may relate to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. 
 
We are also subject to EU laws on personal data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EEA to other jurisdictions which are not considered by the European Commission to offer “adequate” protection of personal data. Such transfers need to be legitimized by a valid transfer mechanism under the GDPR. From January 1, 2021, we are subject to the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (UK) GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending 30 June 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. Further, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. It is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses will also be invalidated by the European courts or legislature. 
 33

There are costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with the GDPR and the resultant changes in the EU and EEA member states’ national laws. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with global privacy laws carries with it the risk of significant penalties and sanctions of up to €20 million or up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year. Additionally, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, and the expiry of the transition period, companies have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. These laws or new interpretations, enactments or supplementary forms of these laws, could create liability for us, could impose additional operational requirements on our business, could affect the manner in which we use and transmit patient information and could increase our cost of doing business. Claims of violations of privacy rights or contractual breaches, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
 Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. Most recently, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield), under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain. The CJEU went on to state that if a competent supervisory authority believes that the standard contractual clauses cannot be complied with in the destination country and the required level of protection cannot be secured by other means, such supervisory authority is under an obligation to suspend or prohibit that transfer. 
 
These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/ or receive personal data transfers to/ in the U.S.  As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 
In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our bispecific antibody candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 
In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member States are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Member States may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect

controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. 
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law. 
 
We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biological products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. 
 
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
