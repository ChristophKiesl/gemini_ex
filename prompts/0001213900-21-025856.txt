Item 1 Business.
Overview
 
Over the last 15 years, our founders, John Delaney and Steve Case, have worked together on several transactions and through multiple disruptive trends that have helped shape today’s economic and business landscape. We believe we are on the cusp of another transformation, one that is driven by accelerating technological advancements and, importantly, shaped by increasing regulatory and public policy considerations.
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on September 10, 2020, as a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, our company will be focused on target companies operating in the healthcare, financial services, clean energy, consumer products, infrastructure, government to private sector transitions or media sectors that we believe are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that can be unlocked by the convergence of innovation, government policy and regulation. Our sponsor is RAAC Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
 
Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on December 7, 2020. On December 10, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 28,750,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, included in the Units offered, the “public shares”), including 3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $287,500,000, and incurring offering costs of $16,242,914, inclusive of $10,062,500 in deferred underwriting commissions.
 
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 5,166,667 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $7,750,000.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $287,500,000 ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
 
Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating our initial business combination. The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time we sign a definitive agreement in connection with the initial business combination. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

We intend to effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have not engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete an initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. Our entire activity since inception through December 31, 2020, related to our formation, the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
We will provide the holders of our public shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their public shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account. The per-share amount to be distributed to public stockholders who redeem their public shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we pay to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering. For additional information about the redemption rights of public stockholders, see Note 1 to the Financial Statements included herewith.
 
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the “Combination Period”), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
Proposed Berkshire Grey Business Combination
 
On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Pickup Merger Corp, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Berkshire Grey, which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Berkshire Grey, with Berkshire Grey being the surviving corporation of the merger and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as a consequence of the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Berkshire Grey Business Combination”). The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the board of directors of the Company on February 23, 2021 and by the board of directors of Berkshire Grey.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the consideration to be paid in respect of each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Berkshire Grey (“Berkshire Grey Common Stock”) issued and outstanding (other than (i) any such shares held in the treasury of Berkshire Grey and (ii) any shares held by stockholders of Berkshire Grey who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights) immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be a number of shares of newly issued Class A common stock of the Company (with each share valued at $10.00), par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Stock”), equal to (x) $2,250,000,000.00 divided by (y) the number of shares of Aggregate Fully Diluted Company Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Immediately prior to the closing of the Berkshire Grey Business Combination (the “Closing”), all of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Berkshire Grey (“Berkshire Grey Preferred Stock”) will be converted into shares of Berkshire Grey Common Stock.
 
At the Closing, each outstanding option to acquire Berkshire Grey Common Stock and each award of restricted Berkshire Grey Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive an option relating to shares of Class A Stock and an award of restricted shares of Class A Stock, as applicable, upon substantially the same terms and conditions, including with respect to vesting and termination-related provisions, as existed prior to the Closing, except that the number of shares underlying such option and the exercise price and the number of shares subject to restricted stock awards, in each case, shall be determined as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Berkshire Grey have made representations, warranties and covenants that are customary for a transaction of this nature. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement terminate and are of no further force or effect as of the Closing.
 
The Merger Agreement contains additional covenants of the parties, including, among others, covenants providing for (a) the parties to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course through the Closing, subject to certain exceptions, (b) the Company and Berkshire Grey to cease discussions regarding alternative transactions, (c) the Company to prepare with Berkshire Grey’s cooperation and to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of the shares of Class A Stock issued in the Merger (the “Registration Statement”), (d) the Company to prepare with Berkshire Grey’s cooperation and to file with the SEC a proxy statement as part of the Registration Statement soliciting proxies from the Company’s stockholders to vote in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated thereby and certain other matters in connection with the Berkshire Grey Business Combination at a stockholders’ meeting called therefor and (e) the parties providing required notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”).
 
In connection with the Closing, the Company will amend and restate its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its bylaws such that the Company will (i) change its name to “Berkshire Grey, Inc.” and (ii) have a board of directors initially consisting of up to thirteen (13) directors, with one director nominee designated by the Company and up to twelve (12) director nominees to be mutually agreed by the Company and Berkshire Grey.
 
The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions for special purpose acquisition companies, including, among others: (a) approval of the Berkshire Grey Business Combination by the Company’s stockholders and Berkshire Grey’s stockholders, (b) the Registration Statement being deemed effective (c) the Company having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets, (d) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (e) the approval for listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC of the shares of Class A Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, and (f) as a condition to Berkshire Grey’s obligations to consummate the Berkshire Grey Business Combination, the Company having at least $200,000,000 in available cash, after taking into account payments required to satisfy the Company’s stockholder redemptions and the net proceeds from the PIPE Investment (as defined below).
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the Closing, including (a) by mutual written consent of the parties, (b) by either the Company or Berkshire Grey if a final and nonappealable order has been issued or governmental action that permanently makes consummation of the transactions illegal or otherwise prevents or prohibits the Berkshire Grey Business Combination, (c) by Berkshire Grey (i) if the Company’s stockholders do not vote to approve the Berkshire Grey Business Combination at the Company’s stockholders’ meeting convened for such purpose, (ii) upon a breach by the Company or Merger Sub that gives rise to a failure of a closing condition that cannot be cured or has not been cured within 30 days’ notice and the Company continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cure, or (iii) if the Berkshire Grey Business Combination is not consummated by August 23, 2021 (the “Outside Date”), unless Berkshire Grey is in material breach of the Merger Agreement, and (d) by the Company (i) if approval by Berkshire Grey’s stockholders is not obtained within two business days of the Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC and delivered or otherwise made available to stockholders, (ii) upon a breach by Berkshire Grey that gives rise to a failure of a closing condition that cannot be cured or has not been cured within 30 days’ notice and Berkshire Grey continues its reasonable best efforts to cure, or (iii) if the Berkshire Grey Business Combination is not consummated by the Outside Date, unless the Company is in material breach of the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. Investors and security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties or covenants, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or, with respect to certain representations, in the event the Closing, as of the date of such closing, or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement and are also modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. The Company does not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an investment decision.

Subscription Agreements
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to purchase an aggregate amount of $165,000,000 in shares of Class A Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, substantially concurrent with, and contingent upon, the Closing (the “PIPE Investment”).
 
The Subscription Agreements for the PIPE Investors provide for certain registration rights. In particular, the Company is required to, within 30 calendar days following the Closing, file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of the securities issued pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. Additionally, the Company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day following the filing date thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.
 
Each Subscription Agreement will terminate with no further force and effect upon the earliest to occur of: (a) such date and time as the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties to such Subscription Agreement; (c) if any of the conditions to closing set forth in the Subscription Agreements are not satisfied on or prior to the closing of the PIPE Investment and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated by such Subscription Agreement fail to occur; and (d) if the consummation of the Berkshire Grey Business Combination has not occurred by the Outside Date.
 
Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company and Berkshire Grey entered into an amended and restated letter agreement (the “Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement”) with each of our sponsor, the Company’s officers and directors and holders of founder shares and alignment shares, which amends and restates the prior letter agreement between the parties, dated December 7, 2020. Pursuant to the Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement, the parties thereto have agreed to modify the lock-up on any founder shares held by such parties so that such shares may not be transferred, except to certain permitted transferees, until the earlier of 180 days after the Closing and subsequent to the Closing, the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of its public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of the Company’s common stock for cash, securities or other property and the lock-up on any other shares of the Company’s common stock held by such parties until the six months after the Closing. In addition, the Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement provides that, among other things, the parties thereto shall vote all of their Common Stock in favor of the Berkshire Grey Business Combination and certain other matters and, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement, not redeem or tender any of their Common Stock in connection with any such vote or in connection with any vote to amend the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Stockholder Support Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a stockholder support agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”), with Berkshire Grey and certain holders of Berkshire Grey securities. Under the Stockholder Support Agreement, the holders of Berkshire Grey securities party thereto agreed to (i) vote all shares of outstanding capital stock with voting rights of Berkshire Grey held by such parties in favor of the Berkshire Grey Business Combination and (ii) approve the conversion of all shares of Berkshire Grey Preferred Stock into shares of Berkshire Grey Common Stock immediately prior to Closing.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
 
The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, the Company will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”), with our sponsor and certain other investors party thereto (collectively, with each other person who has executed and delivered a joinder thereto, the “RRA Parties”), including certain current holders of Berkshire Grey securities (the “BG RRA Parties”), pursuant to which the RRA Parties will be entitled to registration rights in respect of certain shares of Class A Stock and certain other equity securities of the Company that are held by the RRA Parties from time to time.

The A&R Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company will, within 30 calendar days following the Closing, file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of certain shares of Class A Stock and certain other equity securities of the Company held by the RRA Parties. Additionally, the Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th calendar day following the filing date thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.
 
Each of the RRA Parties and their respective permitted transferees will be entitled to certain demand registration rights in connection with an underwritten shelf takedown offering, in each case subject to certain offering thresholds, issuer suspension periods and certain other conditions. In addition, the RRA Parties have certain “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks, issuer suspension periods and certain other conditions. The A&R Registration Rights Agreement includes customary indemnification provisions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any registration statements filed pursuant to the terms of the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, including the fees of legal counsel selected by the majority-in-interest of RRA Parties initiating a demand registration right. The A&R Registration Rights Agreement also provides for a lock-up on registrable securities held by the BG RRA Parties so that such BG RRA Parties may not transfer such shares, except to certain permitted transferees, for 180 days following the Closing.

Market Opportunity
 
While we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, if the Berkshire Grey Business Combination is not completed, we intend to focus our search for a prospective initial business combination on target companies that we believe are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that can be unlocked by the convergence of innovation, government policy and regulation. Healthcare, financial services, clean energy, consumer products, infrastructure, government to private sector transitions and media are large markets containing many companies we believe have long-term growth potential driven by disruption and significant regulatory and public policy considerations that we believe can be unlocked with the experience to guide them through their next phase of growth. In our judgment, technology is not a sector, but a catalyst and a competency and it will be a critical component in our evaluation of any potential business combination opportunity.

● | Healthcare — Digitization, consumerization, data accessibility and reforms are redefining healthcare. However, while medical innovation and new business models can transform lives, structural challenges within the U.S. healthcare industry limit access, affordability and quality. We believe that John Delaney’s relationships with healthcare providers and tech-enabled businesses, coupled with his deep understanding of the regulatory environment, will provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying business combination opportunities across the complex and multi-layered U.S. healthcare industry. Furthermore, Revolution LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and investment firm co-founded by Steve Case, and its affiliated funds (“Revolution”) has sector expertise through investments such as Talkspace and Tempus.

● | Sports, Media and Entertainment — We believe that changes in consumer behavior resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will endure and create long-term growth prospects across the sports, media and entertainment sectors. We believe that our founders are well positioned to generate proprietary and quality deal flow in this category that may present us with opportunities for business combination targets. For many years, Revolution has closely followed the changing landscape of sports, sports betting, e-sports, media and entertainment and the ways in which technology is disrupting the ways in which consumers interact with sports and sports content. Additionally, Revolution’s partners have extensive access to professional sports leagues, team owners and sports media investors. Previously, Revolution’s expertise and access created opportunities for it to invest in three high-performing assets in this category: Sportradar, DraftKings and Scopely. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer and Food — We believe we will gain significant credibility as value-add partners with attractive deal flow in this sector through Revolution. Revolution has invested in two category-leading fast casual restaurant brands, Sweetgreen and Cava, which has led to consistent inbounds from high-growth restaurant and food companies. We also believe that Revolution’s investments in CustomInk, CLEAR, Glowforge and Orchard, which are each tech-enabled, consumer-facing companies, also give us market credibility to look at other emerging consumer brands and services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financial Services — Technology is redefining financial services. We believe that emerging technologies will bring about new innovation in the financial services sector, resulting in disruption of existing participants and creating opportunities for service providers needed to help incumbents stay relevant. We believe that John Delaney’s experience as the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of two public financial service companies will help us capitalize on opportunities in this sector. Revolution’s track record in the financial services industry includes its investment in Tala, a company that is providing loans to millions of people in developing countries around the world. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clean Energy Infrastructure and Services and Carbon Removal — While significant investment has flowed into renewable power development, we believe that other areas of climate solutions will begin to see increase capital flows driven by public policy and innovation. We believe that climate adaptation will produce one of the largest infrastructure builds in U.S. history, requiring new forms of service providers and financing mechanisms. We further expect carbon removal to move to the mainstream of climate solutions. During his time in the U.S. Congress, John Delaney was a leader on policies encouraging infrastructure, carbon pricing and negative emissions technologies. We believe that his experience building innovative financial services companies will help us pursue opportunities in these sectors.

We expect to favor opportunities with certain industry and business characteristics, including:
 

● | Growth driven by the acceleration of the digitalization of the U.S. economy, U.S. policy that encourages investing in U.S. industrial capacity, changes in work, healthcare and education and sustainability as a driver of long-term value creation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity for disruption; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive returns on capital dynamics; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consolidation opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Key business characteristics include strong and public market ready management teams, high barriers to entry or significant streams of recurring revenue, opportunity for operational or balance sheet improvement, opportunity for enhanced market positioning and visibility that comes with a public market listing, attractive margins and free cash flow, and technological leadership. We will also consider opportunities where our capital can solve a significant financing need driven by market disruptions or other balance sheet issues that require a recapitalization of an otherwise healthy business.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from its expertise and relationships. Our selection process, if we do not complete the Berkshire Grey Business Combination, will leverage our founders’ relationship network, experiences and deal sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. This network and insights have been developed through our founders’ extensive experience and demonstrated success in business, investing and public, including:

● | A track record of building industry-leading and financially disciplined companies in the lending and credit industries; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Successful acquisitions and the creation of strong financial results and enhanced strategic positions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience building boards of directors, navigating complex regulatory environments, deploying value creation strategies, recruiting world-class talent and delivering operating efficiency; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A deep understanding of macro geo-political trends; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An extensive history of accessing the capital markets across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with transition to public ownership; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A track record of creating and growing multi-billion-dollar platforms in the public markets and structuring innovative financial solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, if we do not complete the Berkshire Grey Business Combination, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:

● | Utilize our founders’ network of contacts, which we believe will provides access to differentiated deal flow, industry analysis and deal-sourcing capabilities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have enhanced growth prospects based on the acceleration of the digitalization of the U.S. economy or from changes in U.S. public policy to encourage the reshoring of U.S. manufacturing; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are at an important inflection point, such as requiring additional capital, management expertise, or public market scale to capitalize on their momentum; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are fundamentally sound companies that are underperforming their potential; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are growth-oriented, market-leading companies within their industries; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have been materially impacted by possible market dislocations and would benefit from capital markets access; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operate with a high standard with respect to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. Our search for a business combination, ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected the recent COVID-19 outbreak. See “Risk Factors — Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the status of debt and equity markets.”
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Each of our sponsor, directors and officers, directly or indirectly, owns founder shares, alignment shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Past experience or performance of Revolution or our sponsor, officers or directors and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (1) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (2) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of Revolution or our sponsor, officers or directors or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. No member of our management team has any experience operating special purpose acquisition companies prior to the Company.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.
 
John Delaney, our Chief Executive Officer, is also the Executive Chairman of Congressional Bancshares, Inc. and a party to a non-competition agreement with Congressional Bancshares. For our initial business combination, we intend to focus on industries that complement John’s background in the financial services, healthcare, technology and consumer and media sectors. As a result of John’s non-competition agreement, certain companies and businesses that we may target for an initial business combination will be limited. See “Risk Factors — John Delaney, our Chief Executive Officer, is a party to a non-competition agreement that limits certain companies and businesses that we may target for an initial business combination. This could negatively impact our prospects for an initial business combination.”
 
Steve Case, a director and one of our founders, is the founder of Revolution, where he serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the investment committees of Revolution Growth, Revolution Ventures and Rise of the Rest Seed. In this capacity, Steve is subject to a contractual duty to offer Revolution certain investment opportunities that meet the investment criteria of the various investment funds, vehicles and other accounts sponsored by Revolution. To the extent that an investment opportunity with respect to a business that would otherwise be suitable for our business combination is first presented to Steve where such a duty exists, he would be required to pursue such investment opportunity through the applicable Revolution fund or vehicle, and such business would not be available to us for our business combination. See “Risk Factors — Stephen M. Case, a director and one of our founders, is subject to various duties to offer certain investment opportunities to one or more entities before our company.”

Revolution may become aware of a potential business combination opportunity that may be an attractive opportunity for our company. However, Revolution is not under any obligation to source any potential opportunities for our initial business combination or refer any such opportunities to our company or provide any other services to our company. Revolution’s role with respect to our company is expected to be primarily passive and advisory in nature. Revolution has fiduciary and contractual duties to its investment vehicles and to certain companies in which Revolution has invested. As a result, Revolution may have a duty to offer business combination opportunities to certain Revolution funds before other parties, including our company, and may seek to engage in transactions with businesses that could have otherwise been attractive business combination opportunities for us. Additionally, certain companies in which Revolution has invested may enter into transactions with, provide goods or services to, or receive goods or services from an entity with which we seek to complete our initial business combination. Transactions of these types may present a conflict of interest because Revolution may directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit as a result of such transaction.
 
Our directors and officers are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. See “Risk Factors — Each of our directors and officers are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”
 
80% of Fair Market Value Initial Business Combination Requirement
 
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. We will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their capital stock, shares or other equity securities in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equalled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Competition
 
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, if the proposed Berkshire Grey Business Combination is not completed, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our shares of Class A common stock, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 1717 Rhode Island Avenue, NW 10th floor, Washington, D.C. 20036. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have one officer and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
