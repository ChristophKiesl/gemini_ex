Item 1. Business 

Overview
Splunk provides innovative cloud and software offerings that deliver and operationalize insights from data generated by digital systems. This data is growing significantly as a direct result of the prevalence and importance of digital systems used by today’s organizations. Decades of investment in digital transformation have integrated the hardware and software that comprise digital systems into every aspect of how modern organizations operate. The data generated by these systems contains a comprehensive, real-time record of operations, interactions, and transactions that our offerings convert into insights that improve technology and business outcomes. Our solutions for Security, Information Technology (“IT”) Operations, and Observability empower users in technology roles, including application development, IT operations, and cyber security, to monitor and secure digital systems more quickly and efficiently. Business users leverage our offerings to gain visibility to their digital processes in order to deliver better experiences, improve decisions and drive better results in areas including supply chain, inbound and outbound logistics, manufacturing, sales, and service. 
Our offerings provide visibility to our customers’ diverse technology infrastructure including systems deployed on the edge, on premises, and in private and public cloud environments, running software ranging from embedded through monolithic apps to cloud native ones. We also believe our offerings empower operational transformation, helping customers move from reactive, non-scalable and ineffective approaches to proactive, automated, and AI-assisted processes that drive better outcomes even as the scale and complexity of their infrastructures continue to grow. 
The events of 2020 significantly increased the importance of being a digital, data-driven enterprise. The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting an enormous amount of pressure on organizations of all kinds to support new ways of working, to deliver better experiences and outcomes, and to enable entirely new offerings and business models. We believe that Splunk enables organizations to rise to these challenges by leveraging technology to achieve greater efficiency, agility, security, and drive a sustained competitive advantage.

Cloud-first Platform and Solutions. We have reached a key milestone in our cloud transformation, where cloud services represent the majority of our total software bookings. Our cloud services customers have accelerated their time to value and achieved lower total cost of ownership. Most importantly, the rate at which new features and capabilities are delivered to and used by customers is accelerated when using cloud services offerings. Given our customers’ success adopting our cloud services offerings, we will continue to invest heavily in differentiated cloud services offerings delivered through a cloud-optimized go-to-market and support model. We will continue to invest in our software offerings to enable both standalone consumption and hybrid Splunk deployments that span customer on-premises and cloud environments. We expect our cloud services offerings will continue to be an important source of growth for Splunk and our customers.
Expand the Splunk value proposition with broader and deeper capabilities. We will continue to focus our product strategy and go-to-market approaches on our Security, IT Operations, and Observability users and we will expand the Splunk Platform and Splunk Solutions offerings that serve them. We intend to deliver new and enhanced capabilities, as well as services that provide faster time-to-value and easier adoption and expansion. We also plan to deliver new features tailored to meet the specific needs of users, including more comprehensive data reach, more powerful analytics, and AI/ML and automation capabilities. While we are focused on extending our industry analyst-recognized leadership across Security, IT Operations and Observability, our customers benefit from even greater value when multiple organizations are generating insight using the Splunk Platform.
Global Expansion. We continue to invest in go-to-market, operations and infrastructure to deliver our services to customers in targeted countries across multiple geographies. Splunk has had success in global expansion as evidenced by our increased mix of revenues outside of the U.S. and we continue to see this as a significant growth opportunity.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our offerings, develop new end-market specific solutions and apps, conduct software and quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing offerings. As we shift our focus to cloud services offerings we will make significant investments in a cloud-
optimized delivery model while continuing to invest in our software offerings, both for standalone consumption and for deployment in hybrid environments. 
Acquisitions and Investments
We enhance and expand our offerings both through our own research and development efforts and through acquisitions and investments. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that can accelerate the delivery of new capabilities, entry into new market segments and our technical expertise.
Intellectual Property
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, internal policies and contractual provisions to protect our technology and intellectual property rights. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the jurisdiction in which such right arises. We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We file trademark, patent, and copyright applications to protect our intellectual property.
Generally, we retain ownership of software we develop. All software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code or as a cloud service pursuant to browser-wrap, embedded or on-line license or service terms, or signed customer agreements. These agreements generally contain restrictions on duplication, disclosure, reverse engineering, transfer and license circumvention. 
We use open source software in our offerings and business, including as incorporated into software we receive from third party commercial software vendors or technologies obtained through acquisitions, and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Additionally, we, including companies that we have acquired, have intentionally made certain proprietary software available on an open source basis, both by contributing modifications back to existing open source projects, and by making certain internally developed tools available pursuant to open source licenses, and we plan to continue to do so in the future. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to expand market awareness, generate sales pipeline, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth and enablement for adoption and customer success. 
Sales
We sell our offerings directly through field sales, inside sales and indirectly through different routes to market with various partners. We gather prospects through a broad range of marketing campaigns, programs and events. Our sales development teams handle lead qualifications. Large or complex transactions generally are handled by our globally distributed direct field sales teams. Our sales engineers help define customer use cases, pre-sales qualification and evaluation.
Our field sales teams are organized geographically across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). We also have a dedicated sales team focused on government customers, which includes United States federal, state and local government entities.
In addition to acquiring new customers, our sales teams are responsible for securing renewals of existing contracts, as well as increased adoption of our offerings by existing customers. To accomplish this, our field sales and customer success teams work closely with our customers to ensure adoption and overall account health, which fosters expanded usage through higher capacity or upgrades and additional use cases.
Marketing
We focus our marketing efforts on generating opportunities for our sales force and partners, increasing awareness of the Splunk brand, driving viral adoption, and communicating product advantages and business benefits. We market our offerings as a targeted solution for specific use cases and as an enterprise solution for a broad range of data and use cases. We 
engage with existing and potential customers to provide community-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our cloud services and software offerings within these customers. We engage business press, technology press, industry analysts and influential voices to create awareness for Splunk in our target markets.
