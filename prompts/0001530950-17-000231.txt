INTRODUCTION 
Post Holdings, Inc. is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144. We are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in the center-of-the-store, foodservice, ingredient, refrigerated, active nutrition and private label food categories.

On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) from our former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “POST.” Post operates in five reportable segments:

On September 19, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bob Evans, a producer of refrigerated potato, pasta and vegetable-based side dishes, pork sausage, and a variety of refrigerated and frozen convenience food items. Bob Evans also has a growing foodservice business which sells a range of products, including sausage, sausage gravy, breakfast sandwiches and side dishes.

Our Businesses
Post Consumer Brands 
Post Consumer Brands includes our North America cereal business which manufactures, markets and sells branded and private label RTE cereal and hot cereal products. The RTE cereal category is one of the most prominent categories in the food industry. According to Nielsen’s expanded All Outlets Combined (xAOC) information, the category was approximately $8.4 billion for the 
3

52-week period ending October 28, 2017. We have leveraged the strength of our brands, category expertise, and over a century of institutional knowledge to create a diverse portfolio of cereals. Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the United States with a 19.1% share of retail dollar sales and a 21.9% share of retail pound sales for the 52-week period ending October 28, 2017, based on Nielsen’s xAOC information. Nielsen’s xAOC is representative of food, drug and mass merchandisers (including Walmart), some club retailers (including Sam’s Club and BJs), some dollar retailers (including Dollar General, Family Dollar, and Fred’s Super Dollar) and military. Our RTE cereal brands include Honey Bunches of Oats, Pebbles, Oreo O’s, Great Grains, Grape-Nuts, Post Shredded Wheat, Oh’s, Honeycomb, Golden Crisp, Post Raisin Bran, Alpha-Bits, Shreddies, Malt-O-Meal branded bagged cereal and Mom’s Best. Our hot cereal brands include Malt-O-Meal Hot Wheat, Coco Wheats, Better Oats and Mom’s Best Oatmeal. These products are primarily manufactured through a flexible production platform at ten owned facilities in the United States and Canada. 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment also includes the business of Attune Foods. Through this business, we manufacture and market branded premium natural and organic cereals and snacks, including Uncle Sam high fiber cereals, Attune chocolate probiotic bars and Erewhon gluten-free cereals. Attune Foods also includes the Golden Temple, Peace Cereal, Sweet Home Farm and Willamette Valley Granola Company brands as well as a private label granola business. Attune Foods’ products are largely sold through the natural/specialty channels, as well as in the bulk foods section of both conventional and natural/specialty retailers. Our manufacturing facility in Eugene, Oregon provides us the ability to manufacture a wide variety of product and package formats. Additionally, some products are manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the United States.
After we completed the acquisition of Weetabix on July 3, 2017, we added the Weetabix NA business to Post Consumer Brands. In North America, Weetabix operates a natural and organic RTE cereal and snacking platform in both branded and private label, led by the Weetabix and Barbara’s brands and the Puffins sub-brand, serving the natural and specialty channels and conventional retailers. These products are primarily manufactured at two facilities, one in the United States and one in Canada.
Michael Foods Group 
Through our Michael Foods Group segment, we produce and/or distribute egg products, refrigerated potato products, cheese and other dairy case products and pasta products. Our egg products business produces and distributes numerous egg products under the Better’n Eggs, All Whites, Papetti’s, Abbotsford Farms, Emulsa, EasyEggs, Table Ready, and Davidson’s Safest Choice  brands, among others. Through this business, we operate thirteen egg products production facilities in the United States, some of which are fully integrated, from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products. For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, egg and egg products contributed 27.2%, 28.2% and 32.5%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue. Refrigerated potato products are marketed primarily under the Simply Potatoes and Diner’s Choice brands; this business maintains a main processing facility in Minnesota, with a smaller facility located in Nevada. Our cheese and other dairy-case products are marketed principally under the Crystal Farms brand, and other trademarks include Crescent Valley, Westfield Farms and David’s Deli. Through this business, we operate a cheese packaging facility in Lake Mills, Wisconsin, which processes and packages various cheese products for the Crystal Farms brand and for private label customers. Our pasta business, Dakota Growers, has vertically integrated durum wheat milling and pasta production capabilities and produces over 150 different shapes of pasta products at two manufacturing plants. The Michael Foods Group sells products to the foodservice, food ingredient and retail grocery markets. Major customers include foodservice distributors, restaurant chains, major retail grocery chains and other packaged food manufacturers. 
Active Nutrition 
Our Active Nutrition segment markets and distributes ready-to-drink beverages, bars, powders and other nutritional supplements under the Premier Protein, Dymatize, PowerBar, Supreme Protein and Joint Juice brands. The Active Nutrition segment’s products are primarily manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the United States and Europe. We also own a facility in Germany that primarily manufactures bar products for our PowerBar brand and private label customers. Our Active Nutrition products are primarily sold in club, mass merchandise, grocery, drug, specialty and convenience stores as well as online. For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, protein-based products and supplements contributed 13.6%, 11.4% and 11.9%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Private Brands 
Our Private Brands segment manufactures and distributes organic and conventional private label peanut butter and other nut butters, baking nuts, dried fruit and trail mixes, with sales to grocery retailers and customers in the food ingredient and foodservice channels primarily in the United States and Canada, and also in the European Union and the Middle East. We also co-manufacture peanut butter and other nut butters for national brands, private label retail and industrial markets. Our Private Brands business also provides peanut blanching, granulation and roasting services for the commercial peanut industry.

Weetabix
Our Weetabix segment primarily markets and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal products. Weetabix holds the number two overall position in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) RTE cereal category. Its portfolio includes the Weetabix brand, which holds the number one brand position in the U.K. RTE cereal category, as well as Alpen (the number one muesli brand in the U.K.), Weetos, Ready Brek and Weetabix On The Go. Its main markets are the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland where Weetabix has deep relationships with all key retailers and key players in wholesale and foodservice. Weetabix also distributes products to multiple countries throughout the world, mainly through a network of third party distributors in the respective markets. Additionally, Weetabix has operations in Africa through two joint ventures.
For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, cereal and granola products sold by our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments together contributed 37.6%, 36.6% and 29.4%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also use traditional outdoor, print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events and business drops, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment. 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. We also sell Post Consumer Brands products to military, e-commerce and foodservice channels and may utilize distribution or similar arrangements for sales of Post Consumer Brands products. Our Michael Foods Group segment aligns its sales and marketing efforts by distribution channel, with a dedicated team for each of the commercial and retail channels. Our Active Nutrition segment uses a flexible sales model that combines a national direct sales force, broker network and distributors. Our Private Brands segment primarily sells its products through internal sales staff and broker organizations, including a strong broker network that services the natural/specialty and conventional grocery channels. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. domestic markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans. 
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients and packaging technologies; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations. We incurred expenses of approximately $18.6 million, $16.3 million and $16.8 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for research and development activities. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) consist of ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for most of our businesses are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, other grain products, vegetable oils, fruits, peanuts, almonds and other tree nuts, dairy and soy-based proteins, cocoa, corn syrup and sugar. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. Additionally, the principal ingredients for the Michael Foods business are eggs, potatoes and cheese. A portion of the segment’s egg needs comes from Company-owned hens, and the balance is purchased under third party contracts and in the spot market. Principal ingredients for the Active Nutrition business are protein and protein blends. Certain of our segments, such as Post Consumer Brands, Active Nutrition, Private Brands and Weetabix, utilize raw material sources that ensure that their products meet standards and certification requirements for non-GMO, organic and/or gluten-free. The principal packaging materials used by the Company are linerboard cartons, corrugated boxes, plastic containers, flexible and beverage packaging and cartonboard. 
Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to weather conditions, feed costs, labor disputes, government policies and regulations, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances, such as avian influenza which could affect the domestic poultry industry and our egg supply. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources.
Cereal processing ovens and most of the Michael Foods production facilities are generally fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our processing facilities. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in the event of an interruption 
5

in natural gas supplies. Oil also may be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam and can be operated using either natural gas or oil.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business’ key trademarks include Post®, Honey Bunches of Oats®, Great Grains®, Post® Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size® Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp®, Alpha-Bits®, Oh's®, ShreddiesTM, Post® Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts®, Honeycomb®, Frosted Mini Spooners®, Golden Puffs®, Cinnamon Toasters®, Fruity Dyno-Bites®, Cocoa Dyno-Bites®, Berry Colossal Crunch®, Malt-O-Meal®, Farina®, Dyno-Bites®, MOM’s Best®, Better OatsTM, CoCo WheatsTM, Weetabix®, Barbara’s®, Puffins®, SnackimalsTM, Attune®, Uncle Sam®, Erewhon®, Willamette Valley Granola CompanyTM, Peace Cereal® and Sweet Home Farm®. The key trademarks for Michael Foods Group include Crystal Farms®, All Whites®, Papetti’s®, Better’n Eggs®, Easy Eggs®, Emulsa®, Table Ready®, Davidson’s Safest Choice®,  Abbotsford Farms®, Simply Potatoes®, Diner’s Choice®, Crescent Valley®, Westfield Farms® and David’s Deli®. Our Active Nutrition segment’s key trademarks include Premier Protein®, Joint Juice®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, Supreme Protein® and PowerBar®. Our Private Brands business’ key trademarks include Golden BoyTM, Golden Organics® and Country OrchardTM. Our Weetabix segment’s key trademarks include Weetabix®, Alpen®, WeetosTM, Ready BrekTM, Weetabix On the GoTM and OatbixTM. Our trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the United States or the United Kingdom, as well as in many other countries where the related products are sold.
Certain of our products, such as Pebbles™ and Oreo O’s®, are sold under trademarks that have been licensed from third parties pursuant to a long-term license agreement that covers the sale of such branded products in the United States, Canada and several other international markets.
Similarly, we own several patents in North America and elsewhere. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events. For example, demand for our egg products, cheese and snacking and baking nuts tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first quarter of our fiscal year. Demand for our Malt-O-Meal hot wheat and Ready Brek hot oats cereals also tends to be seasonably skewed towards the colder winter season. However, on a consolidated basis our revenues and results of operations are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year.
Working Capital
A description of our working capital practices is included in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Cash receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our operating expenses and working capital needs.
Customers
We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery, mass merchandise, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty and drug store customers. We also sell to military, e-commerce and foodservice channels. Our Michael Foods Group’s primary customers include foodservice distributors, national restaurant chains, retail grocery stores and major food manufacturers and processors. Our Active Nutrition segment’s customers are predominately warehouse club stores, mass merchandise, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, specialty retailers, supplement stores and online retailers. Our Private Brands segment’s products are sold primarily to the natural/specialty and conventional grocery stores and foodservice and food ingredient customers. Our Weetabix segment’s products are primarily sold to grocery stores, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores. 
Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2017 consolidated net sales, but certain of our segments depend on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for approximately 29% of Post Consumer Brands’ net sales in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the largest customers of our Michael Foods Group segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for approximately 27% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2017, and the largest customers of our Active Nutrition business, Costco and Sam’s Club, accounted for approximately 57% of the Active Nutrition segment’s net sales in fiscal 2017. The largest customers of our Private Brands segment, Whole Foods and Aldi, accounted for approximately 26% of Private Brands’ net sales in fiscal 2017. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for approximately 32% of Weetabix’s net sales in fiscal 2017. 
6

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, sales to locations outside of the United States were approximately 8%, 7% and 9% of total net sales, respectively.
Competition
The consumer food and beverage, sports nutrition, and sports supplement categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Many of our principal competitors in these categories may have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources. Competition is based on product quality, price, effective promotional activities, and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products. The industries in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our business in the United States. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. Additionally, following the recent adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA is implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Certain egg products produced by our Michael Foods Group segment are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and its regulations regarding quality, labeling and sanitary control, rather than FDA regulations. The Michael Foods egg processing plants that break eggs, and some of our other egg-processing operations, are subject to continuous on-site USDA inspection. Our other U.S. facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA, FDA and/or state regulatory authorities, such as state departments of agriculture. 
Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulatory agencies in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on prices and supplies of these commodities.
Our operations also are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Our foreign facilities are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the United States. Additionally, Michael Foods Group layer farms dispose of animal waste primarily by transferring it to farmers for use as fertilizer, and Michael Foods Group potato product facilities dispose of solid vegetable waste primarily by transferring it to processors who convert it to animal feed. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure environmental compliance. 
Employees
We have approximately 11,410 employees as of November 1, 2017, of which approximately 9,140 are in the United States, approximately 1,060 are in the United Kingdom, approximately 830 are in Canada and approximately 380 are located in other jurisdictions, including the Weetabix Africa joint ventures. Currently, approximately 18% of our employees are unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. As these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
