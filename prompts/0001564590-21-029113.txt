Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
 We are a leading provider of 100% cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software. We generate revenue from the sale of software subscriptions and professional services. Our software combines networks, data and applications to provide a deeply embedded, mission-critical platform that allows customers to optimize their supply chain by accelerating growth, reducing costs, increasing visibility and driving improved resiliency. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, we maintain long-term relationships with our customers, which is reflected by our high gross retention and average customer tenure. In aggregate, we serve more than 1,200 customers in over 180 countries across a wide range of end-markets, including technology, consumer, industrial and transportation, among others.
 We operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a TAM of more than $45 billion. This TAM is comprised of significant whitespace, which we estimate is more than $1 billion. This opportunity within our existing customer base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often a combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications, many of which are tied together with manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing has evolved from brands owning the full production lifecycle to orchestrating disparate manufacturing, distribution and selling processes, supply chains have grown more complex, increasing demand for software solutions like ours and the need to modernize the existing technology landscape with cloud-based modern solutions. We believe our fully cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a differentiated solution for customers that gives them better value as compared to solutions offered by some of our competitors.

Our Platform
 Our harmonized SaaS platform brings together networks, data and applications to facilitate end-to-end supply chain visibility across planning, execution and procurement and delivers a strong value proposition.
Network
 Our network combines four distinct, but connected, ecosystems: Demand, Supply, Logistics and Global Trade, which we estimate supports more than 220,000 trading partners and captures more than eight billion transaction data points each year.
 Our Demand ecosystem represents the global footprint established by retailers, distributors, re-sellers and those who sell goods primarily through online channels. We estimate that we process over $2 billion in claims every quarter, more than 40 million channel sales transactions every month and over 94 million channel inventory transactions every month.
 Our Supply ecosystem is comprised of companies and other participants for which we source components and materials and/or provide manufacturing capacity for the production of goods. We estimate that, at any moment in time, we oversee an average of more than 58 million shipments as well as process an average of over 61 million orders and 17 million invoices for our customers and supply and manufacturing network participants based on samples taken over a 12-month period.
 Our Logistics ecosystem includes global logistics services that transport components, raw materials and finished goods across all modes. We estimate that we facilitate over 26% of global ocean container bookings within this ecosystem in addition to tracking the movement of over 46 million containers every month.
 Our Global Trade ecosystem allows participants to automate the global movement of goods and facilitate cross-border transactions for businesses, which we believe is increasingly important given the velocity with which import and export laws change on a global scale. This ecosystem provides our network with data on trade regulations across more than 180 countries that we estimate supports annual processing of over 12 million export pre-customs entry lines, 15 million free trade agreement bill of materials qualifications and 92 million restricted party-list screenings, annually.
 Our network connects participants across all of these ecosystems, enabling customers to analyze data, identify problems proactively and optimize asset efficiency. We are a leading provider with a unique network of ecosystems, and do not rely on third party providers for network information.

Data
 Our proprietary algorithms capture the data within our network ecosystems that feed our solutions to deliver compelling value to our customers. Additionally, our customers can combine internal and external vendor data with our network to drive informed decision-making based on real-time information. We believe our ability to capture and harmonize data from our customers and their trading partners in any native format demonstrates the strong capabilities of our software architecture and integrated data model. We believe that our combination of network ecosystems, data and applications providing end-to-end supply chain visibility and connecting more than 220,000 trading partners is unique.
Applications
 Our end-to-end applications provide artificial intelligence and machine learning-based advanced analytics to help customers gain insights for enhanced decision-making across supply chain planning, execution and procurement functions. Our applications are organized into seven product families: Channel Shaping, Demand Sensing, Business Planning, Global Trade Management, Transportation and Logistics, Collaborative Manufacturing and Supply Management.
 Channel Shaping allows customers to optimize activity across retail, distributor and online channels, which includes capabilities for partner selection, aligning market incentives, managing on-shelf availability, tracking sell-through and inventory as well as managing performance incentives.
 Demand Sensing utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast demand based on historical trends, current sell-through dynamics, weather and other relevant factors.
 Business Planning helps ensure optimized global performance through scenario-based planning and execution algorithms balancing supply, demand, inventory and financial targets.
 Global Trade Management automates import and export processes to enable efficient and compliant cross-border trade while optimizing customs duties and reducing broker fees.
 Transportation and Logistics orchestrates the movement of goods by allowing customers to connect with key stakeholders to optimize carriers, simplify tendering, track shipments and streamline payments.
 Collaborative Manufacturing provides comprehensive visibility into internal and external manufacturing activities by monitoring yields, quality, cycle-times/utilization and other key indicators to track performance, identify deficiencies and facilitate corrective actions.
 Supply Management ensures the continuity of supply by orchestrating procurement, capacity, inventory management and drop-ship fulfilment across multiple-tiers of the manufacturing process.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following competitive strengths will contribute to our ongoing success.
 Attractive Industry Tailwinds and Large TAM
 We participate in the growing SCM software industry. We estimate that the TAM is more than $45 billion across North America and Europe, and we anticipate this market will continue to grow. Several secular trends are increasing the demand for SCM software, including:

• | Complexity of Global Supply Chains
--+-----------------------------------


o | Brand owners have transitioned from being manufacturers to orchestrators that produce little, but manage a vast network of outsourced trading partners that support their minute-by-minute operations across channel, manufacturing, supply, global trade and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | As supply chains become increasingly global and complex, SCM software is essential to run supply chains efficiently at scale.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Need for Integrating Siloed Data to Drive Decision Making
--+----------------------------------------------------------


o | Manufacturers are increasingly focused on utilizing disparate data to drive more efficient decision making.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | Historically, data to help manufacturers bring their products to market has existed in silos within various departments of the manufacturers, as well as across their extended partner ecosystems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Access to timely and comprehensive data is valuable not just to each department within a manufacturer, but also critical for partners of the manufacturer to run efficient operations on its behalf.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Brand owners are increasingly focused on applying data from different parts of the supply chain to make more informed manufacturing decisions, such as using retail demand sensing to forecast required manufacturing output.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Brand owners are increasingly focused on a flexible, multi-modal value proposition spanning carriers, shippers and third-party logistics providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory Environment Complexity
--+----------------------------------


o | Manufacturers increasingly need to navigate complex frameworks of regional and local taxes, tariffs and regulatory compliance protocols.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | SCM software solutions help automate these tasks and reduce the regulatory burden for companies, which will continue to be a strategic priority.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic Consolidation
--+-------------------------


o | Shippers and third-party logistics providers operate in a global environment and want to execute within a single technology platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Many SCM technology solutions have historically had stronger capabilities within the region in which they were initially developed. North America is the most developed, with Europe served by a smaller number of SCM software solutions while Latin America and Asia-Pacific (APAC) are comparatively underpenetrated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain Disruption
--+------------------------


o | As a result of disruptions related to COVID-19 and recent events like the Suez Canal blockage, it has become increasingly important to diversify supply chains to mitigate disruption risk resulting from concentration within a supply chain. The complexity that arises from diversifying a supply chain and increasing the number of trading partners across more geographies and production facilities drives further demand for SCM software.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the TAM has approximately 85% whitespace for modern SCM solutions. Many companies currently rely on legacy on premise applications or homegrown and/or spreadsheet-based solutions created over time, each of which require significant manual effort to achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility. Moreover, these SCM solutions often rely on latent and one-off point-to-point connections with partners for collecting data. These alternatives provide less value and are significantly more error prone, creating an attractive competitive dynamic within the industry for modern SCM software providers where there is significant opportunity to grow without the need to replace an incumbent competitor. We believe there is more than $1 billion of whitespace for the solutions we already offer, which we believe provides very actionable growth opportunities through expanding our existing customer relationships.
 Category-Defining End-to-End Provider of Mission-Critical Software
 As businesses have transitioned from being owners of the production lifecycle to orchestrators of discrete manufacturing, distribution and selling processes, they have increasingly looked to software solutions to manage this growing complexity. However, most SCM software has not been designed to address these challenges comprehensively, and manufacturers often employ multiple point solutions with siloed data and processes that inhibit visibility, resulting in sub-optimal decision-making based on inaccurate or outdated information. Our approach, which is built around a cloud-based SaaS platform with end-to-end visibility and real-time, network-powered data, provides best-of-breed functionality across the supply chain and facilitates optimal supply chain performance.
 As described above, we operate a software platform that integrates network ecosystems, data and applications across a harmonized and simplified user interface, driving a compelling value proposition and return on investment for our customers. This has created a mission-critical software solution and long-term relationships with customers as evidenced by our high gross retention rate. Additionally, we have been widely recognized as a differentiated leader by Gartner, International Data Corporation, Nucleus and others in the realm of multi-enterprise solutions, which we believe will be the future of SCM software. In May 2021, E2open was placed by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant with the highest ability to execute and completeness of vision in its 2021 Magic Quadrant for Multienterprise Supply Chain Business Networks for the second year in a row.

Strong Network Effects Enhanced by a Flexible and Integrated Data Model
 Our core offerings are underpinned by an integrated data model that facilitates the flow and processing of data for participants across several ecosystems and applications. This model facilitates low latency, “many-to-one-to-many” data exchange across trading partner ecosystems. The combination of our integrated and flexible data model along with the four network ecosystems powers our customers’ solutions allowing them to efficiently orchestrate their end-to-end supply chains. This architecture is designed to ensure that each participant and data source within these ecosystems enhances our applications, which in turn improves the network and the value we deliver to our customers and participants alike.
 Our software architecture and ability to harmonize disparate forms of data create a scalable software platform that can efficiently integrate acquisitions and new product applications seamlessly into a consolidated and holistic SaaS solution. Our software architecture and this ability has been a driving force behind our robust track-record of successful acquisition integrations, and we believe our scalable platform will allow us to generate substantial value through tuck-in and transformative acquisitions in the future.
 
Importantly, we believe there is incremental value we can create by utilizing the data flowing through our network to develop insights that can further help our customers as well as other target markets. We plan to work to develop a comprehensive strategy to capture this market opportunity and deepen our relationships with customers, which has the potential to meaningfully accelerate revenue growth.
 Long-Term Relationships with Diversified and Blue-Chip Customer Base with Proven Wallet Share Expansion
 We deliver solutions for some of the largest brand owners and manufacturers globally, and we estimate more than 125 of our customers have annual revenues of over $10 billion. We believe we are mission-critical to our customers’ operations, as evidenced by our gross retention. We possess a diverse customer base consisting of more than 1,200 clients that spans a broad spectrum of industries including the technology, industrial, consumer and transportation sectors, among others.
 Our customers utilize our solutions to orchestrate their supply chains, which we believe enables them to realize significant value and return on investment. For example, a leading consumer packaged goods company was able to cut forecast errors by 40% and reduce inventory by 35% using our product suite. They are now able to leverage our platform to forecast every product using artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. Moreover, a leading high-tech company has utilized our software to realize $300 million in savings over three years. An additional example includes a high-growth, large-scale consumer technology platform, which utilized our software to reduce its execution time from eight weeks to seven days, creating substantial opportunity to accelerate their revenue growth in addition to reducing costs.

In March 2021, the Suez Canal was blocked for six days after the grounding of Ever Given, a container ship. During this crisis, our customers utilized our tools to monitor and respond to the situation, making real-time adjustments to their supply chains.
 Growth Strategies
 We intend to profitably grow our business and create shareholder value through the following strategic initiatives:
 

Expand Within Existing Customers
 As described above, we believe there is significant opportunity to drive growth through expansion of our existing customer relationships. We have an opportunity to more than triple our revenue over time without any new logos, new products or acquisitions given that we believe there is more than a $1 billion of whitespace. Our acquisition strategy is focused on acquiring complimentary best-of-breed point solutions to incorporate into our integrated end-to-end platform. As a result, we currently sell just one SKU to many of our customers, as most acquired companies had only one product to offer their customers. We believe this represents a significant opportunity to cross-sell additional products to these customers, accelerating growth and strengthening relationships with our installed base, especially as it grows over time with new customer wins. Importantly, we have a strong track record of achieving growth within our existing customer base. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020, we increased the recurring revenue with a leading consumer packaged goods company, a leading industrial manufacturer, a blue-chip technology firm and a global hardware and software technology provider by 2.7x, 2.0x, 1.9x and 1.6x, respectively.
Win New Customers
 As part of our growth strategy, the second growth lever is winning new customers, which we anticipate accelerating by optimizing our sales force through several measures. First, we plan to invest in our salesforce by hiring account acquisition experts, funded by identified savings projects across various areas. Additionally, we plan to pursue strategic partnerships and leverage the networks of our new board of directors to elevate conversations with C-level executives at key targets in our pipeline. We also intend to utilize 
 10


these relationships and networks as well as our own channel reseller and partner network to accelerate growth through the onboarding of new customers.
 Continue Strategic Acquisitions
 A third lever of our growth strategy is to continue strategic acquisitions. We plan to utilize a disciplined approach to acquisitions, focusing on opportunities that will create value by strategically broadening our product offering as well as financially through the realization of integration-related synergies. Our key strategic acquisition criteria include mission-critical solutions in core markets; complementary cloud applications with minimal product overlap; new customer relationships in vertical or geographic markets; and TAM, proprietary data and/or network expansion. We have a large pipeline of actionable targets, including one large and transformative opportunity as well as a larger list of tuck-in opportunities identified in accordance with the criteria described above.
 We have a demonstrated track record of success in expanding our product offering and accelerating growth through acquisitions. Through our acquisitions of INTTRA Inc. (INTTRA) and Amber Road, Inc. (Amber Road), we were able to enhance our value proposition to customers through the addition of ocean shipping logistics solutions as well as global trade management offerings, both of which contributed to our ability to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility. The acquisition of INTTRA increased the power of our network ecosystems through the integration of 26% of the global ocean freight data, which further strengthened the network effects of our software platform and business model. Our acquisition of Amber Road enhanced our platform by providing customers with global trade management solutions to automate their import and export processes and help improve sourcing decisions across more than 180 countries. Importantly, we also have a track record of efficiently integrating acquired solutions operationally and financially. Across each of our acquisitions since 2015, we have met or exceeded our integration-related cost savings targets in each case and with 20% cumulative outperformance as a whole.
 Additional Organic Growth Building Blocks
 We also believe there are several additional building blocks of organic growth acceleration that provide a margin of safety for achieving our annual steady-state subscription revenue growth target, including price/value maximization, data and analytics, sales force optimization and partnerships/new sales channels.
Intellectual Property
 We consider the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information to be an important facet of our business. We own a number of trademarks, patents, copyrights and domain names registered in the United States and abroad that, together, are meaningful to our business, including the E2OPEN, Amber Road and INTTRA marks (among others). From time to time, we have pursued enforcement of our intellectual property rights against third parties and expect to do so in the future when cost effective. In addition, we enter into customary confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors involved in the development of our intellectual property.
Government Regulation and Compliance
 We are subject to various laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions, including the European Union, by supranational, national and local government authorities, including with respect to sanctions compliance, privacy laws, labor and employment laws and other laws. In the United States, our global sanctions compliance is monitored by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), and certain of our subsidiaries have received a license from OFAC permitting certain business, transactions or other activities involving sanctioned countries. We monitor these regulatory requirements, including the requirements for retaining our OFAC license and our compliance on a regular basis.
Organizational Structure
 Following the completion of the Business Combination, our organizational structure is what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership C corporation (or Up-C) structure. This organizational structure will allow certain owners of E2open Holdings to retain their equity ownership in E2open Holdings, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of Common Units, Series 1 RCU and Series 2 RCU. Each continuing owner of E2open Holdings also holds a number of shares of Class V common stock equal to the number of Common Units held by such owner, which has no economic value, but which entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share at any meeting of our shareholders. Those investors who, prior to the Business Combination, held Class A ordinary shares or Class B ordinary shares of CCNB1 and certain other investors and vested option holders will, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in the Company, a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Significant Agreements
 For information related to our significant agreements, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.
 Seasonality
 Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including seasonality in our business as a result of customer budget cycles and customary European vacation schedules, with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.
Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (JOBS Act), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of CCNB1’s initial public offering (IPO), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 Human Capital
 We believe our success in delivering 100% cloud-based, end-to-end SCM software relies on our culture, values, and the creativity and commitment of our people. As of February 28, 2021, we had 2,436 full-time employees with 650 in North America, 207 in Europe and 1,579 in Asia-Pacific, respectively. Our core operating principles are the foundation for our success:

• | be prepared;
--+-------------


• | build relationships on trust and respect;
--+------------------------------------------


• | be direct and transparent;
--+---------------------------


• | learn and operate with intensity;
--+----------------------------------


• | make and meet commitments reliably;
--+------------------------------------


• | always add value; and
--+----------------------


• | own the results.
--+-----------------

We invest in our people and strive to maintain a healthy, safe and secure work environment where our employees are treated with respect and dignity. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a fully virtual workplace, accommodating school, family and the health needs of our employees. We also implemented travel restrictions for all non-essential business in a manner consistent with local standards and risks. We endeavor to create an inclusive and diverse community that inspires collaboration, integrity, engagement and innovation while offering the opportunity for personal and professional growth.
 We use a framework called E2-Connect to encourage a continual open and interactive communication between employees and their manager allowing individual needs to be recognized and met and company goals to be supported. This allows the employee and their manager to establish a professional development plan that facilitates personal employee growth while advancing our strategy. 
 We also work to keep our employees updated on our developments, achievements and new product offerings through various All-Hands meetings with our senior leadership team, as well as all employees. We consistently work to improve the employee experience by addressing feedback collected through the various surveys throughout the year, including manager interaction, employee benefits and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 To ensure our employees’ personal and professional growth, we developed E2open University where employees can participate in various online training classes. These training classes are continually developed or new classes are added, so that our employees have a full range of classes available. Each year, our employees receive role-specific training which includes topics, such as our products overview, anti-harassment, insider trading, cyber security awareness, compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and other compliance and industry-specific subjects.
