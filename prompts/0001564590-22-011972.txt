Item 1. Business.  
 We are a biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology platform to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas. We are initially focused on developing oral therapeutics against well-validated targets in immunology, with the goal of achieving comparable potency to their systemic biologic counterparts, which have demonstrated the greatest therapeutic benefit to date in these disease areas. Our platform, which we refer to as DELSCAPE, is designed to discover selective oral small molecules with the potential to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as effectively as systemic biologics. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for convenient oral therapies in chronic immunological diseases that offer the therapeutic benefits of systemic biologics. 
 Our lead therapeutic candidate, DC-806 (previously referred to as S011806), is an oral antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule, interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is a validated drug target implicated in a variety of immunology indications. There are two approved antibody therapeutics, COSENTYX (secukinumab), marketed by Novartis, and TALTZ (ixekizumab), marketed by Eli Lilly, but no oral therapies targeting this pathway. COSENTYX and TALTZ both are approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and collectively generated approximately $6.9 billion in worldwide sales in 2021. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom approved our Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for DC-806 in September 2021 and we are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients. 
 We also are developing oral therapeutic candidates targeting α4ß7 integrin and αVß1/αVß6 integrin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), respectively. We plan to nominate therapeutic candidates for these programs by the end of 2022, in the case of α4ß7, and by the end of 2023, in the case of αVßx. Additionally, we will regain worldwide rights by July 2022 to a previously partnered oral immuno-oncology program, small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitors discovered using our DELSCAPE platform. Leveraging DELSCAPE, we are also evaluating other novel and validated immunology targets, including interleukin-23 (IL-23), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), among other potential targets, with a view toward advancing one or more programs into clinical development. 
 Biologics Have Transformed the Inflammatory Disease Landscape, but Are Not Ideally Suited for Chronic Treatment 
 Some of the most clinically and commercially successful drugs are biologics that modulate extracellular signaling by binding to cellular receptors or their ligands. One such class of biologics is monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which represented an over $150 billion market in 2020. Drugs such as HUMIRA (adalimumab), and REMICADE (infliximab), originally approved in the late 1990s and early 2000s, have transformed the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, IBD, and psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. Although the latest generation of approved biologics demonstrate improved efficacy and dosing intervals, they continue to face the same underlying challenges: (i) requiring administration through subcutaneous injections or intravenous infusions and (ii) regular patient monitoring. Despite generally inferior therapeutic benefit to biologics, there remains a strong preference among many patients and clinicians for orally-administered therapeutics.

Our Proprietary Approach and DELSCAPE Enables the Development of Oral Small Molecules Against Targets Previously Only Druggable with Antibodies 
 Our approach to drug discovery and development leverages the capabilities of DELSCAPE to determine feasibility, optimize the design of and generate families of specific and potentially potent therapeutic compounds that we consider ideal for advancement to clinical development. We combine this approach with an assessment of attractive, validated market opportunities, informed by our expertise in the field of immunology, to determine our priority targets. We have used this approach to develop therapeutic candidates against the four targets in our current pipeline, and we plan to further pursue this historically difficult class of targets, known as PPIs. The below graphic illustrates our proprietary drug discovery and development strategy. 
 
Opportunity: Target-Validation and Market Opportunity. Central to our process is the identification of targets with strong mechanistic or clinical validation—and in many cases, commercial validation as well. This validation provides us with confidence that modulating the target can provide clinically meaningful benefit in treating human disease, with the goal of reducing the biology risk associated with drug development. In addition, we prioritize programs where the target activity in Phase 1 clinical trials has predicted clinical benefit in subsequent trials for other compounds. Ideal opportunities include indications for which there are only marketed biologics against the target of interest and where we believe that an oral therapy with comparable efficacy would be preferred. There are a number of such opportunities within immunology—approved anti-IL-17 mAbs, for example—in which an oral small molecule capable of blocking the same interaction as its injectable biologic counterpart likely would be a clinically and commercially successful therapeutic. Because the targets of biologics are often PPIs, very few small molecules have been developed against these targets. 
 4


Feasibility: PPI-Disruption of Dimeric and Trimeric Targets. We then, based on an assessment of feasibility, prioritize potential targets with structural features that make them ideal candidates for small molecule inhibition using our approach. Inhibition of PPIs by small molecules historically has been challenging because interactions between proteins usually involve large, complementary binding areas that lack features that would allow for small molecules to selectively bind and directly block the PPI. Antibodies can overcome this limitation due to the large nature of their complementary binding areas, but their large size makes them unsuitable for oral administration as they are not absorbed in the gut. We believe that the best opportunities for orally-dosed, small molecule inhibitors of PPIs are presented by targets that are dimeric (having two discrete components) or trimeric (having three discrete components). We have observed that opportunities for potent and selective small molecule binding may be found at the interfaces between the protein components. Importantly, in preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that our small molecule constructs effectively blocked a PPI without directly obscuring the interaction surface. For example, as shown in Figure 1 below, crystal structures show that our IL-17 inhibitors bind in a cleft between the two components of an IL-17 dimer and do not directly block the face that interacts with the IL-17 receptor. Although the bound small molecule (shown in green) does not directly block the receptor-binding surface, it potently inhibits the binding of IL-17AA to the receptor. 
 
Figure 1: (a) Receptor-bound structure (PDB: 4HSA) of the homodimer IL-17AA with IL-17 receptor hidden to view surface contacts involved in the PPI. The two IL-17A monomers are colored blue and bronze and atoms within 4.0Å of IL-17RA are colored red. (b) Structure IL-17AA with our small molecule inhibitor bound in the cleft between the two monomers. Although the bound small molecule does not directly block the receptor-binding surface, it potently inhibits binding of IL-17AA to the receptor.
Our integrin programs provide additional examples of small molecules that have demonstrated the ability to bind at the interface between dimeric proteins and block interaction with their PPI partners. We have identified additional targets of interest, including IL-23, TNFα, FcRn and TSLP, showing evidence of small molecule binding sites at their dimer and trimer interfaces and we intend to explore these opportunities to expand our pipeline of oral PPI inhibitors. 
 DELSCAPE Platform: Accelerating Hit-to-Lead Development. Finally, we utilize our proprietary DNA-encoded library (DEL) chemistry to accelerate the hit-to-lead phase of compound optimization. We use DEL in a novel way, producing libraries that incorporate known binders—often with poor potency, selectivity or drug-like properties—into the library design, greatly increasing the percentage of hits and thus the depth of structure-activity relationships (SAR) we can obtain from a single experiment. With our proprietary approach, we generate smaller, targeted libraries, typically between 100,000 and 1 million discrete compounds, and obtain data that enables both quantitative and qualitative assessment of a landscape of small molecule hits. We therefore do not need to aim for the massive diversity (billion to trillions of compounds) reported by companies that conventionally utilize unbiased DELs for hit-finding and, importantly, not for the hit-to-lead phase of compound optimization. Our approach can extend well beyond binding optimization to further produce insights into functional activity and selectivity. We think of this process as performing medicinal chemistry but on a very large scale, in parallel, and it is what allows us to accelerate this phase of drug discovery against these difficult PPI targets.

Our Pipeline 
 We are leveraging our proprietary DELSCAPE platform to design and develop a pipeline of wholly-owned oral therapeutic candidates against validated biologic targets to address chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas. Our pipeline is shown below: 
Our Oral Therapeutic Candidates Targeting IL-17 for Immunology Indications 
 Our lead therapeutic candidate, DC-806, is an orally-available small molecule antagonist of IL-17 being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the injectable biologics, COSENTYX and TALTZ, with potential expansion of development into indications known to be responsive to IL-17 inhibition. COSENTYX and TALTZ are anti-IL-17 mAbs that inhibit both IL-17AA and IL-17AF isoforms, but not the IL-17FF isoform, and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other foreign regulatory authorities, for the treatment of psoriasis and other immunology indications. The global psoriasis drug market was estimated to be $23.5 billion in 2021 according to Evaluate Pharma, and approved anti-IL-17 mAbs comprised an estimated $5.2 billion. The total market opportunity for therapeutics targeting all IL-17 mAb-approved indications, including psoriasis, represented $30.0 billion in 2021, of which anti-IL-17 mAbs captured $6.9 billion. 
 In psoriasis, results from pivotal trials for COSENTYX and TALTZ show therapeutic benefits that are approximately double those shown in the pivotal trials for apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor marketed as OTEZLA by Amgen. Despite its inferior therapeutic benefit, OTEZLA generated sales of $2.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to the convenience of its oral administration for patients and clinicians. We therefore believe an oral IL-17 small molecule inhibitor with comparable therapeutic benefit to its systemic biologics counterparts represents a significant market opportunity in psoriasis and other immunology indications where IL-17 inhibition is relevant, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and hidradenitis suppurativa. 
 In preclinical studies, DC-806 was able to selectively inhibit both IL-17AA and IL-17AF isoforms, while sparing the IL-17FF isoform. Furthermore, we have shown that DC-806 matched the anti-inflammatory activity of an anti-IL-17 mAb in a well-established animal model. The MHRA in the United Kingdom approved our CTA in September 2021 and we are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, followed by a Phase 1c trial in psoriasis patients. 
 Our IL-17 expertise, coupled with DELSCAPE, has enabled us to build what we believe is the most comprehensive and functional DEL for IL-17 small molecule inhibitors in the industry, and has resulted in the generation of multiple potential therapeutic candidates of IL-17 inhibitors with structural classes distinct from 
 6


that of DC-806. To take advantage of the depth of our IL-17 capabilities, we intend to advance two additional, structurally-distinct therapeutic candidates through IND-enabling studies, and to progress another candidate into clinical trials. In the second half of 2021, we nominated a development candidate, DC-853, a differentiated fast-follower molecule that in pre-clinical studies has been shown to inhibit IL-17 AA and AF with a mechanism of action similar to that of DC-806. We believe that advancing multiple platform-derived therapeutic candidates unlocks the ability to develop compounds with differentiated properties and has the potential to maximize the value of our IL-17 franchise. 
 Our α4ß7 Integrin Antagonist Program 
 Alpha 4 beta 7 (α4ß7) is a powerful signaling molecule embedded in the cell membranes of immune cells and is an established target for IBD. ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) is an anti-α4ß7 mAb which is approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). We believe that there is an unmet need for convenient oral therapies for these indications due to their chronic nature. The dimeric nature of integrins (which consist of one alpha protein subunit and one beta protein subunit), as well as the existence of chemical starting points enabled us to apply DELSCAPE to identify potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitors of α4ß7. We believe that the high selectivity for α4ß7 over α4ß1 is a key feature of ENTYVIO and will be critical for the development of a small molecule therapeutic. Our lead compounds demonstrate over 1,000-fold selectivity for α4ß7 over α4ß1. In contrast, TYSABRI (natalizumab) binds to both α4ß7 and α4ß1, and this selectivity for α4ß1 has been linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, resulting in the FDA restricting its use in IBD. Our α4ß7 program is in the lead optimization stage and we expect to nominate a therapeutic candidate for this program by the end of 2022. 
 Our αVß1/αVß6 Integrin Antagonist Program 
 We are also pursuing antagonists of the alpha V (αV) family of integrins with the intent of developing therapeutic candidates for the treatment of IPF and other fibrotic diseases. Increased expression of the integrins alpha V beta 1 (αVß1) and alpha V beta 6 (αVß6) has been observed in patients with IPF and it has been demonstrated that increased levels of αVß1 and αVß6 drive increased activation of TGF-ß, a potent pro-fibrotic mediator. Preclinical data indicates that inhibitors of αVß1 and αVß6 have potential as therapeutics for the treatment of IPF and other fibrotic diseases by reducing TGF-ß activation. DELSCAPE enabled us to identify potentially potent inhibitors of αVß1 and αVß6 with a variety of selectivity profiles ranging from αVß1-selective, to dual-selective, to αVß6-selective. In the case of αV integrins, the optimal selectivity profile between αVß1 and αVß6 has not been established in the clinic. We are therefore advancing multiple leads with different selectivity profiles. Our αVß1/αVß6 program is in the lead optimization stage and we expect to nominate a therapeutic candidate for this program by the end of 2023. 
 Our Collaborations 
 Given the broad therapeutic potential of our DELSCAPE platform, we have selectively partnered with leading pharmaceutical companies, including Sanofi and Genentech, for drug targets outside our core strategic focus in immunology. Our collaborations with Sanofi and Genetech are now concluded, and prospectively we remain open to opportunistically evaluating and entering into strategic partnerships around certain therapeutic candidates, geographic markets or disease areas. We presently have a collaboration with Insitro, which is designed to combine our DELSCAPE platform and Insitro’s machine learning-enabled drug discovery capabilities for the discovery and prediction of potential therapeutic candidates. 
Our Team 
 We are led by a team of executives with extensive experience in small molecule drug discovery and development. J. Kevin Judice, Ph.D., our CEO and co-founder, previously served as Chief Scientific Officer at Cidara Therapeutics, a company he helped found. Earlier in his career, he co-founded Achaogen and served as its CEO and CSO. Scott Robertson, our CFO and CBO, served as Business Development Director for DuPont Pioneer and previously was an investment professional at MPM Capital. Timothy Lu, M.D., Ph.D., our Chief Medical Officer, was a Senior Medical Director at Genentech in inflammatory diseases including IBD. John Jacobsen, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, previously was Senior Director of Medicinal Chemistry at Theravance where he led multiple research programs in respiratory diseases and helped transition six compounds into clinical development.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to be an industry leader in PPI disruption biology and drug development. We intend to develop a broad portfolio of oral therapeutic candidates for immunologic diseases with our PPI disruption approach. Our strategies to achieve this goal are: 

• | Maximize the value of our IL-17 franchise by advancing DC-806 through clinical development in psoriasis, exploring potential development in other indications where IL-17 is implicated and advancing at least one other IL-17 inhibitor into clinical development. We believe our lead program, DC-806, has the potential to capture a significant share of the multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity in psoriasis by addressing the high unmet need of patients seeking effective, oral therapeutics. Our CTA was approved in September 2021 and we are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients. We intend to advance this program through clinical development, leveraging insights from the drug development and regulatory pathways of already-approved anti-IL-17 mAbs. Following the completion of our planned Phase 1c trial in psoriasis, we intend to explore development of DC-806 in other diseases where anti-IL-17 mAbs are already marketed, including non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis, as well as those where anti-IL-17 mAbs have demonstrated clinical efficacy, such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Furthermore, we are advancing two additional, structurally-distinct therapeutic candidates through IND-enabling studies, and intend to progress another IL-17 inhibitor candidate into clinical trials with the goal of maximizing the value of our IL-17 franchise.

• | Advance our selective α4ß7 and αVßX integrin antagonists into the clinic for development in IBD and IPF and potentially other indications, respectively. We are developing an orally-available α4ß7 integrin antagonist intended to drive anti-inflammatory activity for the treatment of moderate-to-severe IBD. Given the lack of orally-available therapeutics that can safely and effectively achieve sustained remission, we believe that there would be a substantial commercial opportunity for an oral α4ß7 antagonist that could deliver comparable anti-inflammatory activity to the currently marketed biologic and standard of care, ENTYVIO, without the burden associated with injectable administration. Our α4ß7 antagonist program is currently in lead optimization and we anticipate nominating a therapeutic candidate by the end of 2022. Our αvßx program is designed to selectively inhibit various dimeric combinations of the αv integrin family for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including IPF. Our αv integrin programs are in the lead optimization stage and we expect to nominate therapeutic candidates for each program by the end of 2023.

• | Leverage DELSCAPE and our immunology and PPI disruption expertise to expand our portfolio of therapeutic candidates. Our novel use of DELs enables us to explore significantly more structural variants of known active lead molecules than would be practical using traditional medicinal chemistry approaches. This differentiated approach to discovery underpins the demonstrated power of DELSCAPE to generate potential clinical candidates against conventionally difficult-to-drug PPI targets and we believe significantly expands the number of biologic targets that can be modulated with oral small molecules. We are continuing to invest in our computational chemistry capabilities to accelerate our library design and data analysis as we identify and interrogate new targets using DELSCAPE. We have identified additional targets relevant and validated in immunology, such as FcRn, TSLP, TNFα and IL-23, among others, that meet our target selection criteria, and we expect to identify additional targets in the future. We plan to dedicate a portion of our drug discovery efforts toward at least one of these promising targets with the goal of expanding our portfolio of immunology therapeutic candidates.

• | Evaluate and selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of our pipeline. We remain open to opportunistically evaluating and entering into strategic partnerships around certain therapeutic candidates, geographic markets or disease areas. For example, in anticipation of the large global commercial opportunity that a highly effective oral IL-17 antagonist may generate, we may consider partnering DC-806 in late-stage clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization. In addition, we may partner with leading pharmaceutical companies for drug targets outside our core strategic focus in immunology. We believe selectively entering into collaborations has the potential to expand and accelerate the development of our programs and maximize worldwide commercial potential.

Our Drug Discovery Approach 
 DELSCAPE is one part of a larger approach to the selection and prosecution of historically difficult PPI targets. When selecting targets for our internal pipeline, we evaluate a number of parameters in parallel before settling on proteins for investigation in our labs. 

• | Validated targets. We believe that our expertise in small molecule design is best applied to targets that have been validated in the clinic by injectable antibody therapeutics in settings where we believe we can develop orally-available small molecules. This validation provides us with confidence that modulating the target can provide clinically meaningful benefit in treating human disease, with the goal of reducing the biology risk associated with drug development. In addition, we prioritize programs where the target activity in Phase 1 clinical trials has predicted clinical benefit in subsequent trials for other compounds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunology-focused. We believe that some of the greatest needs for orally available drugs exist in therapeutic areas related to immunology where the most effective currently approved therapies are administered by injection. Diseases in this therapeutic area are often chronic in nature and require lifelong dosing, thereby compounding the burden on patients and clinicians. Accordingly, we believe an orally-administered therapeutic with biologic-like efficacy would be highly attractive for patients and clinicians in this therapeutic area.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dimeric or trimeric protein-protein interactions. There are many therapeutic targets that can be targeted by small molecules. The small molecules in our focus are those that are intended to alter PPIs. Historically, those PPI targets have been refractory to inhibition by small molecules. We believe that at least part of the problem has been that the proteins involved in PPI often lack appropriate binding sites for small molecules. In situations where one of the PPI partners is a dimeric or trimeric protein, however, it can be the case that a small-molecule binding site exists at the interface of such a dimer and that compounds binding there can inhibit the larger interaction, as shown with IL-17 in the figure below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemical starting points. A key feature of DELSCAPE is that it works best when we are able to structurally bias the libraries by using prior SAR of compounds that have been shown to bind to the target in question. We specifically focus on protein targets that fulfill three key criteria: (i) known binders with suboptimal potency, selectivity or drug-like properties have been identified for them; (ii) we have structural insights into how these compounds bind; and (iii) we can identify precise locations where DNA tags could be attached without blocking binding activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our DELSCAPE Platform
 Our DELSCAPE platform leverages a chemical technique known as DELs in a novel way that we believe improves our ability to prosecute historically difficult targets such as PPIs with oral small molecule inhibitors. 
 Historical Design and Utilization of DNA-Encoded Libraries 
 DELs were developed to enable the synthesis and screening of vast numbers of small molecule drug candidates at a scale that is not possible to achieve by traditional approaches. By covalently linking each small molecule in a large collection (library) of possible hits to a unique DNA tag, each member of the library then carries a barcode that specifies its structure and the means used to make it. Because each member of the library carries its own unique barcode, the entire collection of molecules in the library can be tested simultaneously for their ability to bind to a specific target. In such an assay, the target is immobilized to a solid support and then a sample of the library is passed over it. Individual members of the library that bind to the target thus stick tight, allowing the other, non-binding components of the mixture to be washed away. In the final step of the process the binders are identified, using a procedure such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to read their DNA barcodes. This process typically produces a small number of binders, or hits, which can then serve as starting points for a labor-intensive medicinal chemistry process known as hit-to-lead optimization. 
 Historically, DELs have been used to generate very large libraries of compounds, typically ranging in size from billions to trillions of individual members. It was felt that the large number of compounds would increase the chances of finding hits, or binders to the target. While this is true in some instances, it overlooks an inescapable fact of such a large library, which is that the few hits within it are vastly outnumbered by compounds that do not bind to 
 9


the target. Thus, there is very little true signal and a great deal of noise, meaning that even using a technique as sensitive as PCR to read the barcodes of hits one must somehow deal with overwhelming amounts of what are known as false positives, or compounds that appear to bind to the target but are really just random noise. As a result, it can be difficult to get much more useful information from a traditional DEL library than a few hits with which to start a long and manually driven hit-to-lead optimization process. 
 For these reasons, we believe that traditional DELs represent an incremental advance over approaches that precede them, but they do not offer general solutions to the problem of generating useful drugs against historically difficult targets such as PPIs. 
  DELSCAPE Accelerates Hit-to-Lead Phase of Drug Discovery
 We take a fundamentally different approach to the use of DELs. Rather than focus on making ever-larger collections of compounds, we took the counterintuitive path of making ours smaller. Our libraries are instead designed to have greater focus, with a lower number of distinct compounds than libraries generated for broad screening. They typically have between 100,000 and 8 million discrete compounds, which greatly increases the signal to noise ratio—positive binders—by reducing the noise of non-binders by between a thousand- and a million-fold. As a result, we can elucidate quantitative information on entire families of structurally related compounds in a single experiment, rather than just identifying a few hits. This concept is shown in Figure 3 below. 
 
Figure 3: Our focused libraries are designed to provide the ability to conduct high-throughput medicinal chemistry due to a higher signal-to-noise ratio. In this figure, each bar represents an individual compound where the height of the bar represents its potency. Our focused libraries have multiple structurally related compounds allowing us to gain insight into the impact of series of small chemical modifications on potency. This rich collection of information about the potency of SARs can then inform the design of additional compounds with other drug-like properties such as stability, and therefore contributes to an overall acceleration of the hit-to-lead phase of small molecule drug discovery. This is particularly important when attempting to tackle historically difficult targets such as PPIs.
 In the figure above on the left, we are illustrating what we call a SAR landscape. In such a figure, one can envision the three-dimensional plot with the X- and Y-axes describing structural features of the molecules under study, while the Z-axis (or vertical axis) describes the relative binding affinity of a given molecule for its target. Each vertical spike in the figure on the left thus represents an individual molecule, while the height of the spike reflects the relative binding affinity of that molecule, with higher spikes corresponding to tighter binders to the target in question. 
 10


As illustrated in the plot on the left, there are many spikes arising from the analysis of this large library. However, the ratio of true signal to random noise, described above, will limit the investigator’s ability to elucidate all of the information that would otherwise be available from such an experiment. We envision this limitation graphically as a signal to noise floor, below which no useful information can be gleaned and represented here as a transparent gray plane. In this illustration, one can see that only a few spikes protrude above the signal-to-noise floor, thus providing only a few bona-fide hits despite the large number of compounds in the original library. 
 A DELSCAPE experiment is illustrated conceptually on the right side of Figure 3. In this graphic it is clear that the overall size of the library is smaller, as indicated by the smaller area described in the X- and Y-planes; however, as articulated above, this reduction in overall compound number, when combined with the biased design approach described below, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio, indicated graphically here as a lower transparent gray plane. As a result, more spikes protrude above the signal-to-noise threshold and a more comprehensive data set can be derived from this experiment. We have found that libraries constructed and analyzed in this fashion give us numbers of bone fide hits against difficult PPI targets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands, with rank orders of potency attached to each individual hit. This type of experiment can also identify discrete structural families, shown as differently colored groups of spikes on the right side of Figure 3. The information as to identities of richly populated families of hits, when combined with the detailed rank order of potency shown as spikes of varying heights, can facilitate expedited progress through the hit-to-lead phase as other essential properties of candidate drugs are built in to the molecules. 
 To summarize, the advantages of DELSCAPE for targeting PPIs over conventional approaches, including more typical and much larger DELs, are as follows: 
  
• | Higher signal. This lower complexity results in a higher frequency of individual molecules, which serves to increase the magnitude of the signal for active compounds. For example, in a library of 100,000 molecules, an individual molecule is represented 10,000 times more frequently than it would be in a library of one billion molecules.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower noise. In parallel, the smaller number of compounds we create for our libraries helps to lower the number of false positive compounds that contribute to background noise. This noise would be higher using conventional DELs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to deeply explore variants of known active molecules. Our use of DELs enables us to explore far more structural variants of known hit molecules than would be practical using traditional chemistry approaches. Using this approach, we can rapidly identify compounds that meet our pre-specified design objectives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our IL-17 Programs 
 Our lead therapeutic candidate, DC-806, is an orally-available small molecule antagonist of IL-17 being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the injectable biologics, COSENTYX and TALTZ, with potential expansion of development into indications where IL-17 inhibition has shown therapeutic benefit. 
 DC-806 was designed precisely to target the most inflammatory members of the IL-17 family, notably the AA and AF isoforms, with the goal of providing the greatest therapeutic potential and a reduced likelihood of off-target side effects. In preclinical studies, DC-806 was able to selectively inhibit both IL-17AA and IL-17AF isoforms, while sparing the IL-17FF isoform. In clinical trials conducted by third parties, the simultaneous inhibition of all three isoforms has been linked to increased adverse events compared to simultaneous inhibition of IL-17AA and IL-17AF only. 
 In addition, DC-806 has shown equivalent anti-inflammatory activity to that of an anti-IL-17 mAb in a well-established animal model. The MHRA in the United Kingdom approved our CTA in September 2021 and we are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, followed by a Phase 1c trial in psoriasis patients. 
 11


To take advantage of the depth of our IL-17 capabilities, we intend to advance two additional, structurally-distinct small molecule therapeutic candidates through IND-enabling studies, and to progress another candidate into clinical trials with the goal of maximizing the value of our IL-17 franchise. 
 Psoriasis Disease Background 
 Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rapid turnover, excessive proliferation and lack of differentiation of skin cells (keratinocytes). Psoriasis is estimated to affect more than 125 million people worldwide and more than 8 million people in the United States. According to Evaluate Pharma, the global psoriasis market was estimated to be $23.5 billion in 2021. In plaque psoriasis, the most common type of psoriasis, patches of skin called lesions or plaques become red and inflamed and are covered by a white scale. The extent of inflammation can be limited to a few lesions or can involve moderate to large areas of the skin and scalp. A standard measure of disease is the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score which takes into account the percent of body surface area affected and the severity of the lesions. Psoriasis is not simply a cosmetic problem; it is associated with many comorbidities including psoriatic arthritis, CD, psychological and psychiatric disorders, uveitis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular, celiac disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and erectile dysfunction. In a recent survey, nearly 60% of people with psoriasis reported missing an average of 26 days of work a year attributable to their illness. 
The Role of IL-17 Signaling in Psoriasis 
 One of the primary drivers of the inflammatory response in psoriasis is IL-17. IL-17 regulates the proliferation of keratinocytes and down-regulates their differentiation. It also induces keratinocytes to secrete other signaling molecules, called chemokines, that drive the influx of immune cells, including neutrophils and dendritic cells. Skin inflammation is driven by the production of inflammatory molecules such as TNFα and nitric oxide from these immune cells.
IL-17 consists of a family of related cytokines, of which IL-17A and IL-17F are the most well-characterized. Both are expressed by a subset of T cells termed Th17 cells. These proteins naturally assemble into a trio of biologically-active dimeric proteins: IL-17AA, IL-17AF and IL-17FF. IL-17AA is the most potent version of the three and acts as a pro-inflammatory signal in diseases such as psoriasis. The structures of these three isoforms are shown in the figure below. 
 

Figure 4. Structure of the IL-17 isoforms and their relative contributions toward inflammatory signaling. IL-17 is also important in mediating host resistance to extracellular bacterial and fungal infections.

In some patients, excessive secretion of IL-17 by Th17 cells leads to the development of autoimmune disorders. IL-17AF and IL-17FF play lesser but still significant roles in these diseases. Because of its central role in driving psoriasis, IL-17 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. Approved biologics such as COSENTYX and TALTZ inhibit both IL-17AA and IL-17AF, but not IL-17FF. 
Current Treatments for Psoriasis 
 There is no cure for psoriasis; patients and clinicians instead manage the symptoms of the disease with chronic therapeutic treatment. Initial treatments are typically topical therapies including keratolytics, or skin softening agents such as salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid, that serve to loosen dry skin and help reduce inflammation. Patients who do not respond are treated with topical anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs including corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. The drawbacks of topical treatments include poor adherence, skin irritation, the need for continuous use and the lack of efficacy in treating systemic inflammation. 
 Approved Oral Systemic Therapies 
 Patients with more extensive psoriasis, typically covering more than five percent of their body surface area, or psoriasis in areas which are more difficult to treat with topical therapies, such as the scalp, are typically treated with systemic drugs. The first line of systemic therapy after topical therapies are orally administered therapies, but their use is limited by weak long-term efficacy and adverse events. 
 Methotrexate, used to treat psoriasis since 1971, remains the most widely used systemic therapy, although its use continues to decline due to concerns about side effects including hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression that require mandatory routine monitoring. Cyclosporine, a potent immunosuppressant, is another oral option, however, it is associated with a number of adverse events and its use in psoriasis carries a boxed warning for renal toxicity requiring chronic monitoring and limiting long term use. OTEZLA (apremilast), first approved in 2014, is an oral PDE4 inhibitor. In two pivotal clinical trials, 29-33% of patients treated with OTEZLA achieved a PASI 75 response after 16 weeks of therapy, meaning that their PASI score declined by 75% or more following treatment. In the placebo groups, this response rate was only 5-6%. In these trials, patients treated with OTEZLA experienced on average a 30-40% reduction from baseline in their PASI scores at four weeks with an average placebo response of 13-15% reduction. Of the patients who discontinue treatment with OTEZLA, 71% do so because of lack of efficacy. Although safety concerns are considered lower with OTEZLA than with biologic therapies or methotrexate, approximately nine percent of patients treated with OTEZLA experience diarrhea or nausea. Despite these limitations, worldwide sales of OTEZLA totaled $2.2 billion in 2021. 
 A 30-milligram dose of OTEZLA, administered twice daily, was evaluated in two pivotal trials (ESTEEM-1 and ESTEEM-2) with 844 and 413 patients, respectively. 
 Approved Injectable Biologic Therapies 
 If oral therapies fail, injectable biologic therapies are then used. These therapies target inflammatory molecules such as TNFα, IL-17, IL-23 and IL-12/IL-23. Approved biologic therapies typically are able to induce PASI 75 response in 60-90% of patients within 12 to 16 weeks in clinical trials. Two approved anti-IL-17 mAbs, TALTZ and COSENTYX, have some of the highest reported rates of PASI 75 responses achieved within twelve weeks. For TALTZ in its three pivotal trials, this figure was 87-90% (placebo was 2-7%) of patients and for COSENTYX, this figure was 77-82% (placebo was 5%) in its two pivotal trials. By comparison, anti-TNFα, anti-IL-23 and anti-IL-12/23 mAbs have demonstrated PASI 75 responses in 71-80% (placebo was 7-19%), 64-91% (placebo was 6-10%) and 66-76% (placebo was 3-4%) of patients, respectively. 
 In these clinical trials, patients treated with anti-TNFα mAbs or COSENTYX achieved an average reduction in PASI scores from baseline at four weeks of 52-57% (placebo was 9-15%) and 50-65% (placebo not reported), respectively. 
 COSENTYX was evaluated in two pivotal trials (ERASURE and FIXTURE) with 738 and 1,306 patients, respectively. In each trial, COSENTYX was administered 150- or 300-milligrams weekly for four weeks, followed 
 13


by 150- or 300-milligrams monthly, respectively. TALTZ was evaluated in three pivotal trials (UNCOVER-1, UNCOVER-2, and UNCOVER-3) with 1,296 and 1,224 and 1,346 patients, respectively. In each trial, TALTZ was administered with a starting dose of 160-milligrams followed by 80-milligrams either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks. Anti-TNFα biologics were evaluated in two pivotal trials (REVEAL and CHAMPION) with 1,212 and 271 patients, respectively. In each trial, 40-milligrams of anti-TNFα biologics were administered every other week. 
 Despite the high efficacy of biologics, their use for the treatment of psoriasis remains relatively low compared to the population of patients who could potentially benefit. In the United States, an analysis of Medicare claims found that only 10% of moderate-to-severe psoriasis Medicare patients were being treated with biologics. The uptake of biologics has remained limited due to multiple factors including: (i) the fact that biologics are indicated only for use in moderate to severe patients; (ii) their high cost and chronic dosing requirement, which can be as much as $180,000 per year; (iii) reimbursement and access restrictions; (iv) high patient co-pays; (v) a perceived risk of side effects by clinicians; and (vi) the inconvenience of injectable administration. 
 Other Orally-Available Therapeutic Candidates 
 A number of orally available therapeutic candidates have been investigated as potential therapeutics for the treatment of psoriasis. Clinical results from Phase 3 clinical trials found that Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors were able to induce encouraging PASI 75 responses that approached biologic-like therapeutic benefit. However, the high efficacy seen with some drugs, such as tofacitinib, was associated with increased risks of adverse events, resulting in a complete response letter from the FDA, which led to discontinuation of development for this indication. There is a current clinical development focus on inhibitors of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a distantly-related JAK family member, for psoriasis. Bristol Myers Squibb recently reported that patients in two Phase 3 trials of its TYK2 inhibitor, deucravacitinib, achieved PASI 75 responses in 54-59% of patients (placebo was 9-13%) by week 16. Although the results from deucravacitinib are encouraging, they do not appear to match the efficacy demonstrated by most of the approved biologics. 
The Unmet Medical Need in Psoriasis 
 While there are now numerous approved therapies for psoriasis, we believe there remains a significant unmet medical need for patients and clinicians to effectively and conveniently manage this chronic disease. Although the latest generation of approved biologics are considered to be highly efficacious and are generally able to control disease more effectively, there remains a strong preference among many patients and clinicians for orally-administered therapies, which are commercially successful today despite their limitations. For example, more than twice as many psoriasis patients treated with COSENTYX achieve a PASI 75 response within 12 weeks as compared with those treated with orally-available OTEZLA at 16 weeks, as shown in the figure below. Even after extended dosing, the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 response with OTEZLA does not approach that of COSENTYX. Despite this inferior efficacy, OTEZLA generated $2.2 billion in global sales in 2021, driven in part by a preference for oral therapies within the psoriasis community. 
Figure 5. PASI 75 response rates for COSENTYX (secukinumab) and OTEZLA (apremilast) in their registrational clinical trials.
 14


 Accordingly, we believe the prospect of an orally-administered therapy with comparable efficacy to injectable biologics in psoriasis would be a commercially successful therapeutic. In particular, oral therapies that address targets such as IL-17 represent highly attractive opportunities due to the strong clinical validation, known efficacy and low risks of adverse events associated with approved drugs against these targets.
Our Solution: Small Molecule Inhibitors of IL-17 and Our Lead Molecule, DC-806 
 Our lead therapeutic candidate, DC-806, is an orally-available small molecule antagonist of IL-17 being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the injectable biologics, COSENTYX and TALTZ. The MHRA in the United Kingdom approved our CTA in September 2021 and we are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, followed by a Phase 1c trial in psoriasis patients. We also intend to evaluate development of DC-806 in psoriasis and other indications known to be responsive to IL-17 inhibition. To take advantage of the depth of our IL-17 capabilities, we intend to advance two additional, structurally-distinct therapeutic candidates through IND-enabling studies, and to progress another candidate into clinical trials. 
Our Approach to Identifying Small Molecule IL-17AA and IL-17AF Antagonists Using DELSCAPE 
 We based our drug discovery efforts on structural information from small molecules in the literature that are known to bind to IL-17AA. We used this structural information to generate DELs and synthesized and then screened millions of compounds for binding to this site. We were specifically interested in those molecules that bound to IL-17AA but were unable to bind to the IL-17AA plus receptor complex. The results of our screening identified two broad classes of compounds: those that bound with equal potency to the receptor complex and to IL-17AA alone; and those with the desired property that they bound potently to IL-17AA but had weak binding to the receptor complex. Compounds of the latter type are desired because selective binding to IL-17AA alone is consistent with a compound that can inhibit IL-17AA from binding to its receptor as illustrated in Figure 6 below. 
Figure 6: Binding of compounds in a specific pocket in IL-17 can prevent a conformational change required for IL-17 to bind to its receptor, thereby inactivating it.
 15


Through a single screen, we were able to identify compounds that met our initial design objectives and, because of the richness of the number of active compounds, this screen also provided us with a wealth of information about the impact of specific chemical modifications we had made on the binding potency and selectivity of our early candidates. The results from this screen led us to the identification of DC-806 and its  structural class, which selectively inhibit both IL-17AA and IL-17AF isoforms. Further, the results steered us away from working on compounds that were unlikely to ever meet our objective of inhibiting IL-17AA and IL-17AF as shown in Figure 7 below. 
Figure 7: A DNA-encoded custom library for IL-17 binders led to the identification of two classes of molecules, one of which led to our lead therapeutic candidate.
 Mechanism of Action of DC-806 
 We designed DC-806 and our other small molecule inhibitors of IL-17 to bind to a pocket on IL-17AA, the member of the IL-17 family believed to be the primary driver of psoriasis. We have shown that a compound binding to this pocket prevents IL-17AA binding to its receptor, and our preclinical data demonstrated that DC-806 binds to a similar pocket in IL-17AF and prevents its binding to the receptor as well. The net effect is that DC-806 and our other molecules that bind to this site inhibited IL-17AA and IL-17AF signaling to the same extent as anti-IL-17A antibodies, while sparing IL-17FF, as shown in the figure below. 
Figure 8. Structure of the three IL-17 isoforms and their relative contributions toward inflammatory signaling.
 16


DC-806 Has Demonstrated Inhibition of IL-17 
 In preclinical studies, DC-806 has demonstrated that it acts as a potent 1.4 nM binder of homodimeric IL-17AA in vitro with a long half-life of binding of five hours, meaning that once it bound to IL-17AA, it remained bound for a long time, with half of the DC-806 molecules still bound to the same IL-17AA dimer molecule after five hours. As a result, DC-806 prevented IL-17AA from binding to its receptor in a biochemical assay with a potency of 43 nM, as shown in the figure below. 
Figure 9: DC-806 bound to IL-17AA and prevented it from binding to its receptor.
 In reporter cell assays using human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, DC-806 blocked the activation of cell signaling by both IL-17AA and the heterodimeric form of IL-17, IL-17AF, but did not block the activity of the IL-17FF homodimer, as shown in the figure below. 
Figure 10: DC-806 blocked IL-17AA and IL-17AF, but not IL-17FF, signaling in a HEK reporter cell line.
 Consistent with the evidence of specific molecular interactions observed in crystal structures of our inhibitors and IL-17AA, DC-806 is a highly selective inhibitor of IL-17AA and IL-17AF. As evidence of this selectivity and as part of our drug development efforts, we tested DC-806 against a panel of 44 common pharmacological targets and showed no evidence of significant inhibition at a high concentration of 10 µM. 
 17


Furthermore, in both immortalized and normal human keratinocytes, DC-806 blocked the ability of IL-17AA to stimulate secretion of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 1 (CXCL1) and Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) with potencies between 4.6 and 68 nM, demonstrating that DC-806 inhibited inflammatory signaling in the target cells of interest as well as decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines associated with psoriasis, as shown in the figure below. 
 
Figure 11: DC-806 blocked IL-17AA-induced secretion of CXCL1 and G-CSF by human keratinocytes.
 Head-to-head comparison of DC-806 to COSENTYX (secukinumab) in a cell-based assay 
 To assess the ability of DC-806 to block signaling via IL-17 produced by primary human T- cells, we cultured Th17 cells and used the culture media containing cytokines secreted from these cells to stimulate HEK reporter cells expressing the IL-17 receptor. We determined that the cytokine mixture secreted by these Th17 cells contains IL-17AA, IL-17AF and IL-17FF. As shown in the figure below, DC-806 (blue line, solid blue circles) achieved the same maximal level of inhibition as a high dose of COSENTYX (dotted line). In addition, we observed that compound DX-891126 achieved less overall inhibition than either COSENTYX or DC-806. In a separate experiment, we determined the activity of all three of these molecules against the individual isoforms of IL-17AA and IL-17AF. COSENTYX inhibited IL-17AA and IL-17AF (IC50 values of 0.5 and 8.2 nM, respectively); DC-806 also inhibited IL-17AA and IL-17AF (IC50 values of 12 and 139 nM, respectively); and DX-891126 inhibited IL-17AA (IC50 value of 28 nM) and did not inhibit IL-17AF to any meaningful extent (IC50 value > 10,000 nM). None of the three molecules under evaluation here showed inhibition of IL-17FF at biologically relevant concentrations. 
Figure 12. Comparison of inhibition of IL-17 mediated signaling by COSENTYX, DC-806, and DX-891126.
 18


 We believe that the ability of DC-806 to spare the blockade of IL-17FF signaling may be beneficial, as IL-17FF has been implicated in preventing mucosal infections based on mouse knockout experiments. Consistent with this finding, published results from a Phase 3 trial of bimekizumab, an antibody that blocks all three isoforms of IL-17, indicate that treatment was associated with approximately 19% of patients developing oral candidiasis compared with 3% of patients treated with COSENYTX.
 We tested the in vivo activity of DC-806 in a rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. In this model, immune-driven arthritis was induced by injection of collagen into an ankle joint. Ten days after the initial administration of collagen, rats were treated with orally administered DC-806 or a rat-surrogate for secukinumab that inhibited IL-17AA and IL-17 AF signaling. This is a robust model of inflammation that is known to have a significant IL-17-driven component. The 20 mg/kg dose provides the maximal anti-inflammatory effect achievable by the antibody control. DC-806 matches this level of inhibition, indicating that this small molecule inhibitor can suppress the inflammation driven by IL-17A in a disease model to an equivalent degree as antibody-based therapy, as shown in the figure below. 
 

Figure 13: DC-806 and an IL-17 antibody led to similar levels of anti-inflammatory activity in a rat CIA model, as demonstrated by reduced ankle swelling.
 DC-806 May Reach Therapeutic Concentrations in Humans 
 DC-806 was shown to be 20% and 60% orally-bioavailable in rats and dogs, respectively, indicating that the drug was well absorbed in the gastrointestinal system. Observed clearance in four preclinical species was consistent with that predicted by in vitro studies of metabolism with hepatocytes from those species, providing confidence in the estimation of human clearance from in vitro studies with human hepatocytes. Based on predicted human pharmacokinetics, we believe that it may be possible to achieve plasma concentrations in human subjects and patients consistent with concentrations affording maximal efficacy in the rat CIA model based on a conservative assumption that trough plasma concentrations are the driver of observed pharmacodynamic effect. Moreover, we expect clinical benefit may be achievable at lower plasma concentrations, based on studies showing that the rat CIA model has consistently overpredicted the concentrations necessary for clinical benefit across multiple anti-inflammatory mechanisms. 
 Although we believe DC-806 has the potential to provide clinical benefit, we will need to complete additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy DC-806. The results of these future studies and trials may be different than the results of our earlier studies and trials. We have not received regulatory approval for DC-806, and in order to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize DC-806, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will need to determine it is safe and effective. 
 19


Clinical Development of DC-806 
 Our CTA was approved in September 2021 and we are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients, followed by a Phase 1c trial in psoriasis patients. 
Our IL-17 Novel Scaffold Programs 
 Our IL-17 expertise, coupled with DELSCAPE, has enabled us to build what we believe is the most comprehensive and functional DEL for IL-17 small molecule inhibitors in the industry, and has resulted in the generation of multiple potential therapeutic candidates of IL-17 inhibitors with structural classes distinct from that of DC0-806. Given IL-17 is a well-validated clinical target, we believe that the primary risks associated with DC-806 are those common to small molecule drugs: getting sufficient drug exposure to see PK with a convenient dosing schedule, and safety. To take advantage of the depth of our IL-17 capabilities, we intend to advance two additional, structurally-distinct therapeutic candidates through IND-enabling studies, and to progress another candidate into clinical trials. We believe that advancing multiple platform-derived therapeutic candidates unlocks the ability to develop compounds with differentiated properties and maximizes the value of our IL-17 franchise. 
 

We believe that there will be the potential to develop both DC-806 and other molecules emerging from our IL-17 program in a number of indications in which IL-17 antibodies have demonstrated clinical efficacy including psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. 
 Novel Scaffold Program 1: Nomination of Development Candidate DC-853
 Executing on our stated oral IL-17 franchise strategy, we nominated a development candidate, DC-853, in our Novel Scaffold Program 1 series in the second half of 2021. DC-853 is a differentiated fast-follower molecule that, in pre-clinical studies, has been shown to inhibit IL-17 AA and AF with a mechanism of action similar to that of DC-806. In in vitro assays, DC-853 appears to be more potent against the IL-17 AA and AF isoforms when compared to DC-806. 

Figure 14: DC-806 and DC-853 in vitro potency against IL-17 AA and AF isoforms

In the rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, DC-853 matches the level of IL-17 inhibition exhibited by both an anti-IL-17 antibody and DC-806. DC-853 was able to match this inhibitory effect despite utilizing lower doses than DC-806.

Figure 15: DC-853, DC-806 and an IL-17 antibody led to similar levels of anti-inflammatory activity in a rat CIA model, as demonstrated by reduced ankle swelling.
 
Our Alpha 4 Beta 7 Integrin Program 
 α4ß7 is a powerful signaling molecule embedded in the cell membranes of immune cells and is an established target for IBD. ENTYVIO (vedolizumab), marketed by Takeda, is an injectable anti-α4ß7 mAb which is approved for the treatment of UC and CD. We are developing our orally-available α4ß7 integrin antagonist in a manner designed to mimic the anti-inflammatory actions of ENTYVIO, specifically its high selectivity for α4ß7 over α4ß1. Our lead compounds demonstrated over 1,000-fold selectivity for α4ß7 over α4ß1. In contrast, TYSABRI (natalizumab), marketed by Biogen, binds to both α4ß7 and α4ß1, and this selectivity for α4ß1 has been linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, resulting in the FDA restricting its use in IBD. Our α4ß7 program is in the lead optimization stage and we expect to nominate a therapeutic candidate for this program by the end of 2022. 
 
Ulcerative Colitis Disease Background 
 UC is a form of IBD characterized by inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine. The clinical symptoms of UC are diarrhea and bloody stool. Its clinical course is marked by exacerbations and remissions, which may occur spontaneously or in response to dietary changes, alterations in treatment regimens, or other illnesses or stress. 
 UC can be debilitating and can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications. Frequent diarrhea and bloody stools can lead to weight loss, dehydration and anemia. Persistent UC is associated with an increased risk of developing colon cancer. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that there are three million individuals in the United States with IBD, of which roughly half have UC. A similar number of individuals in Europe are estimated to have UC. 
 UC is typically treated with anti-inflammatory drugs starting with more moderate and locally-delivered drugs, and progressing to systemic immunosuppressive drugs for patients with refractory disease. First line therapy for 
 21


patients with mild disease consists of 5-aminosalicylates such as mesalamine and sulfasalazine. Patients with more severe disease are treated with systemic corticosteroids, with the intent of inducing remission and transitioning patients to better-tolerated drugs such as 5-aminosalicylates for maintenance. Some patients may be treated with systemic immunomodulatory drugs such as azathioprine, cyclosporine and XELJANZ (tofacitinib). Anti-inflammatory biologics such as TNFα antagonists REMICADE (infliximab), HUMIRA (adalimumab) and SIMPONI (golimumab) and the IL-12/IL-23 antagonist STELARA (ustekinumab) are effective in inducing remission in patients with moderate to severe UC. 
 ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) was first approved by the FDA to treat UC and CD in 2014. In clinical trials, approximately 30% of patients receiving ENTYVIO achieved remission at the end of one year of treatment. ENTYVIO is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at zero, two and six weeks, then every eight weeks thereafter. Long term therapy is generally well-tolerated in patients, but frequent dose adjustments have been reported to be required to maintain efficacy. Despite this inconvenience, Entyvio sales in 2021 are anticipated to be approximately $4.8 billion per Evaluate Pharma. 
 Crohn’s Disease Background 
 CD is a chronic inflammatory disease that most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine, although it may involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Both CD and UC are types of IBD and many of the symptoms and demographics overlap. In addition to the potential of CD developing in other segments of the intestine, CD differs from UC in that there can be normal healthy tissue in between patches of diseased tissue in CD, unlike UC where the inflammation is continuous. CD can also occur in all layers of the intestinal wall unlike UC which is limited to the inner most layer. It is estimated that there are 1.5 million individuals in the United States and 1.1 million individuals in Europe with CD. 
 The treatment paradigm for CD is very similar to that of UC with currently approved therapies focused on anti-inflammatory agents. Nearly 60% of CD patients will require surgery within twenty years of diagnosis to treat complications such as fistulas, or abnormal connections between body parts, life-threatening bleeding and intestinal obstructions. 
 While there are numerous approved therapeutics for UC and CD, we believe there remains a significant unmet medical need for patients and clinicians to effectively and conveniently manage these chronic diseases, which we believe could be facilitated by effective oral therapies. 
 Role of the α4ß7 Integrin in IBD 
 Integrins are the principal receptors used by cells to bind to the extracellular matrix. They are heterodimers consisting of one of 24 alpha subunits and one of nine beta subunits, with the 24 different combinations that have been observed involved in a variety of biological roles. Specific combinations of alpha and beta heterodimers have distinct biological functions. The alpha 4 subunit can form heterodimers with beta 1 and beta 7 subunits. In the gut, α4ß7 integrin has been shown to drive trafficking of lymphocytes to mucosal tissues leading to disease pathogenesis in IBD. On the other hand, α4ß1 is associated with other inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Antibodies with activity towards α4ß1, such as TYSABRI, have been approved for the treatment of MS, but carry a boxed warning due to the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy leading to death or severe disability, driven in part by its activity towards α4ß1. ENTYVIO, which binds only to α4ß7 integrin and not α4ß1, does not carry this warning. 
 Integrin Antagonists: Challenges of Small Molecule Development 
 Two integrins of interest in immunologic disease, the integrins α4ß7 and α4ß1, have significant structural similarities, sharing a common alpha subunit. In order to develop a small molecule that provides a comparable therapeutic effect to the mAb ENTYVIO, high selectivity for α4ß7 over α4ß1 is required. Distinguishing between these integrins is a significant challenge with small molecule drugs. We believe our approach gives us an advantage in discovering integrin inhibitors because we can deploy DELSCAPE to assess the potency and selectivity of millions 
 22


of candidate molecules in parallel. The resulting information relating biological activity to chemical structure can greatly accelerate the process of identifying highly selective candidate molecules for clinical development. 
 Our Solution: A Selective α4ß7 Integrin Antagonist 
 Leveraging DELSCAPE, we have identified selective oral small molecule antagonists of α4ß7 integrin that spare α4ß1 integrin. We believe that there is a substantial clinical need and commercial opportunity for an oral α4ß7 antagonist that can deliver the anti-inflammatory activity of ENTYVIO without the burden associated with injectable administration. An additional potential advantage of an oral α4ß7 agonist dosed daily is the ability to rapidly adjust dosing to maintain clinical efficacy in patients, a process that can take some time with an intravenous drug that is administered at eight-week intervals. 
 In an integrin-specific cell adhesion assay, DX-819511, one of our lead molecules, was shown to inhibit α4ß7 while sparing α4ß1, as shown in Figure 15 below. Specifically, DX-819511 had a potency of 2.2 nM against α4ß7 and 2,300 nM against α4ß1, a selectivity ratio of approximately 1,000-fold. We are continuing to optimize molecules related to DX-819511 for potency and physiochemical properties. We anticipate nominating a therapeutic candidate in this program by the end of 2022. 
 
Figure 15: DX-819511 was approximately 1,000-fold more potent in inhibiting cell adhesion through α4ß7 integrin than α4ß1 integrin.
  Our Alpha V Integrin Program
 Alpha V (αV) integrins have been implicated in a number of fibrotic diseases in tissues such as the lungs, liver and kidney. These integrins are heterodimers with the αV subunit paired with different beta subunits in different integrins. There are a number of drug candidates targeting αV integrins in clinical development and the safety and efficacy of various beta subunit selectivity profiles remain to be established. Utilizing DELSCAPE, we have discovered a series of antagonists of αV integrin heterodimers that inhibit the αV integrins αVß1 and/or αVß6, with the intent of developing molecules from our portfolio of αV antagonists as fast-followers against these targets based on proof-of-concept data emerging from ongoing clinical results. We are prioritizing the treatment of IPF as our first intended indication. Our αVß1/αVß6 program is in the lead optimization phase and we expect to nominate a therapeutic candidate by the end of 2023. 
 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Disease Background 
 IPF is a chronic and progressive lung disease of unknown cause for which there are few treatment options. IPF is a form of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, or abnormal scarring that destroys the structure and function of the lungs. As tissue scarring progresses, the ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream is increasingly impaired. Average life expectancy at the time of diagnosis of IPF is estimated to be between three to four years, with approximately 60-80% of patients dying within five years of diagnosis. 
 23


Patients with IPF experience debilitating symptoms, including shortness of breath and difficulty performing daily activities. Other symptoms include chronic cough, fatigue, loss of appetite and weight loss. IPF is a rare disease that affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States, with 30,000 to 40,000 new cases being diagnosed each year. 
 Currently, no medical therapies have been found to cure IPF and patients are routinely provided with supportive care such as supplemental oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation. Two therapies have been approved by the FDA to treat IPF: ESBRIET (pirfenidone) and OFEV (nintedanib). ESBRIET has been shown to have a modest effect on slowing the progression of IPF as measured by forced vital capacity in approximately 15% of patients. In a pivotal trial, ESBRIET was shown to reduce the risk of death at one year by 48% compared to placebo. OFEV is an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases that was shown to reduce the rate of decline of pulmonary function in multiple trials by approximately half and led to significant delays in the time to acute disease exacerbation. Treatment with OFEV is associated with a trend towards increased survival. Despite these limitations, sales of ESBRIET and OFEV in 2021 were over $4.0 billion. There is still a large unmet medical need as IPF remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. 
  Our Solution: A Series of αV Antagonists with Varying Specificities
 Utilizing DELSCAPE, we have generated libraries containing millions of compounds that have αV antagonist activity. By profiling these compounds against various αV heterodimers, we have identified structural features that have led to the generation of compounds that have higher, equal, or lower potency between αVß1 and αVß6. In some cases, this selectivity is over 100-fold. Our DELs have enabled us to perform medicinal chemistry at a scale at least 1,000-fold the throughput of more traditional synthetic approaches, allowing us to rapidly generate and assess chemical variants, as shown in the figure below. 
 

NFigure 16: DELSCAPE led to the identification of chemical structural features that drive selectivity between αVß1 and αVß6.
Our Immuno-Oncology Asset 
 We partnered with Sanofi to apply our DELSCAPE platform outside of our core immunology focus. Our partnered program was a small molecule against an immuno-oncology target that has been clinically validated with antibody therapeutics. Through our collaboration with Sanofi, we were able to identify small molecules that disrupt this immuno-oncology target in a manner mechanistically similar to the approach taken in our IL-17 and integrin programs. Although the antibodies directed to this target have been successful, there are two areas where we believe 
 24


that a small molecule solution could have advantages over a biologic. First, a small molecule may have better tissue and membrane penetration than an antibody, with the potential to deliver increased clinical benefit in solid tumors, and potentially in brain tumors. Second, small molecule drugs, in general, have shorter half-lives than antibody therapeutics. In cases where treatment leads to the development of adverse events, the discontinuation of dosing of a small molecule could lead to elimination of a drug from the body within hours and potentially result in more rapid alleviation of an adverse event than an antibody therapeutic, which could remain active for weeks. In March 2022, Sanofi notified the Company that it no longer intended to develop therapeutic candidates under the partnered program, and as a result we will regain worldwide rights to the program.
 Discovery Programs 
 Our approach to drug discovery and development leverages the capabilities of DELSCAPE to determine feasibility, optimize the design of and generate families of specific and potentially potent therapeutic compounds that we consider ideal for advancement to clinical development. We combine this approach with an assessment of attractive, validated market opportunities, informed by our expertise in the field of immunology, to determine our priority targets. This differentiated approach to discovery underpins the demonstrated power of DELSCAPE to generate potential clinical candidates against conventionally difficult-to-drug PPI targets and we believe significantly expands the number of biologic targets that can be modulated with oral small molecules. We are continuing to invest in our computational chemistry capabilities to accelerate our library design and data analysis as we identify and interrogate new targets using DELSCAPE. We have identified additional targets relevant and validated in immunology, such as FcRn, TSLP, TNFα and IL-23, among others, that meet our target selection criteria, and we expect to identify additional targets in the future. We plan to dedicate a portion of our drug discovery efforts toward at least one of these promising targets with the goal of expanding our portfolio of immunology therapeutic candidates. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that DELSCAPE and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from well-established pharmaceutical and molecule biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
 Although we believe that DELSCAPE and our lead therapeutic candidate address different therapeutic needs, any therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize in the future, will compete with currently approved therapies or new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of and pricing, levels of promotional activity and reimbursement levels for our therapeutics. 
 We are advancing our lead program, DC-806, an antagonist of IL-17 being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis, with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the injectable biologics. There are currently three approved antibody therapeutics targeting the IL-17 pathway: COSENTYX, marketed by Novartis; TALTZ, marketed by Eli Lilly; and SILIQ, marketed by Bausch Health. UCB SA is also developing an anti-IL-17 mAb, bimekizumab, and has submitted an NDA to the FDA for its use in psoriasis. Other classes of injectable biologics approved for use in indications for which IL-17 therapeutics are also approved include anti-IL-12/23 and anti TNFα mAbs, marketed by Abbvie, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, among others. Furthermore, the oral PDE4 inhibitor, OTEZLA, marketed by Amgen, is approved for the treatment of psoriasis In addition, we are aware of other oral therapeutic candidates including TYK2 inhibitors, oral IL-17 inhibitors, and oral RORℽt inhibitors being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb, Abbvie, Nimbus Therapeutics, and Ventyx Biosciences, among others. 
 We are also developing oral therapeutics targeting α4ß7 integrin and αVß1/αVß6 integrin for the treatment of IBD and IPF, respectively. Approved integrin antagonists include TYSABRI marketed by Biogen for the treatment of CD and MS and ENTYVIO marketed by Takeda for the treatment of UC and CD. In addition, we are aware of IBD treatments either approved or in development by Abbvie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Arena Pharmaceuticals among others and IPF treatments either approved or in development by Boehringer Ingelheim, 
 25


Roche and Abbvie, among others. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies that might be complementary to, or necessary for, our current or future programs. 
 Manufacturing 
 Currently, all of our preclinical and clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing are outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs progress and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products. 
Employees and Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 46 full-time employees, including 17 employees with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 31 employees are engaged in research and development. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
 We rely on skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. We are committed to building and maintaining an outstanding team and we focus on a culture that emphasizes scientific innovation, inclusion, collaboration and equity. Attracting, retaining and developing employees from a diverse range of backgrounds to support our research, development and clinical activities is an integral part of our human capital strategy. As part of our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce, we provide competitive compensation and benefits packages including medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, as well as a company sponsored 401K plan. Employees are encouraged to attend scientific, clinical and technological meetings and conferences, and have access to the resources they need to be successful. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our therapeutic candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 For our IL-17 program, as of March 15, 2022, we owned one issued U.S. patent, U.S. Patent No. 11, 274,094, covering our lead clinical candidate (DC-806) and follow-on development candidate (DC-853), which is expected to expire in 2040, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. DiCE Alpha Inc. further owned several patent applications covering our lead clinical candidate (DC-806), inside and outside the United States, including: two pending U.S. patent applications and seventeen pending foreign patent applications, any of which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2040, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. DiCE Alpha Inc. further owned three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, which are expected to expire from 2042 to 2043, if issued from future non-provisional applications that we file, not including any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. We intend to strengthen the patent protection of our programs through additional patent application filings. 
 For our Alpha V program, as of March 15, 2022, we had one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application, which is filed in the name of DiCE Molecules SV, Inc. This provisional patent application is directed to compositions of matter and methods of inhibiting αVß1 or αVß6 integrins. Any patents, issuing from patent 
 26


applications in these families are projected to expire in 2042, notwithstanding any patent term adjustments and extensions that may be available. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. However, such confidentiality agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP) an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial 
 27


sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. 
 FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) and ethics committee for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
  Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including: (i) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible; or (ii) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription product. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is filed, FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months of the date of submission of the NDA to FDA; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months of the date of submission of the NDA to FDA. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not 
 28


approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and 
 29


promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
  Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year 
 30


before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period of exclusivity if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the exclusivity period. 
 Patent Term Extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (ACA) amended the intent element of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 31


Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the Civil Monetary Penalties Law statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA. 
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Further, certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, such as California’s CCPA or Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable state, federal and foreign healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur 
 32


significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. 
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any therapeutic candidates for which obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. 
 There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the MHRA, FDA, EMA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our therapeutic candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a drug from a third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The marketability of any therapeutic candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.

Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
