ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 When used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Kodak” refer to the consolidated company on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.  Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “EKC” and the “Company” refer to the parent company, Eastman Kodak Company.
 Kodak is a global technology company focused on print, advanced materials and chemicals. Kodak provides industry-leading hardware, software, consumables and services primarily to customers in commercial print, packaging, publishing, manufacturing and entertainment. Kodak is committed to environmental stewardship and ongoing leadership in developing sustainable solutions. Kodak’s broad portfolio of superior products, responsive support and world-class R&D make Kodak solutions a smart investment for customers looking to improve their profitability and drive growth. 
 The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.
 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
 Kodak has four reportable segments:  Traditional Printing, Digital Printing, Advanced Materials and Chemicals and Brand.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other and primarily represent the Eastman Business Park operations. 
Traditional Printing 
 
The Traditional Printing segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate (“CTP”) imaging solutions.  The Traditional Printing segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging. 
 
While this segment is experiencing challenges from digital substitution and competitive pricing pressures, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion. Additionally, Kodak seeks to mitigate the impact of market dynamics on pricing and volume pressures and of increases in manufacturing costs, including aluminum prices, through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives.   
 
Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as CTP equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates. 
 
The Traditional Printing products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers.
 
Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.  
 
Digital offset plate offerings include KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates. KODAK SONORA Process Free Plates are prepared directly with a CTP thermal output device and do not require subsequent processing chemistry, processing equipment or chemical disposal. As a result, the plates deliver cost savings and efficiency for customers and promote environmental sustainability practices.
 
Net sales for Traditional Printing accounted for 58% and 59% of Kodak’s total net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
The Traditional Printing segment also provides service and support related to these products.
 On September 1, 2019 Kodak established a strategic relationship with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd (“HuaGuang”) in the People’s Republic of China.  
 The relationship is comprised of an agreement under which Kodak sold its shares of the Kodak (China) Graphic Communication Co. Ltd. entity, which included the offset printing plates facility in Xiamen, China, and related assets and liabilities, to HuaGuang; a supply agreement from HuaGuang to Kodak; and a license agreement under which Kodak licensed its plates technology to HuaGuang to sell into the plates market in China.

RAW MATERIALS
 
The raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to eighteen months prior.  Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials, including silver, from a broad range of suppliers.  While most raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, certain key electronic components and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.  Also, tariffs imposed in the U.S. have the practical effect of reducing to a single source the potential suppliers of lithographic aluminum coils for U.S. production purposes.
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 
Printing equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents. The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including specific technologies such as lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; custom and specialty materials for 3D printing, functional printing materials, material formulations, and deposition modalities; engineered microparticles for specific functions; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance. 
 In addition to patents, Kodak’s intellectual property includes know-how in many of the areas noted above, but in other businesses as well; such as, manufacturing of KSMs for the pharmaceutical industry. 
 Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.
 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
 Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).
 
It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.
 
Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.
 EMPLOYMENT
 At the end of 2020, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 4,500 people globally, of whom approximately 1,900 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 Kodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.
