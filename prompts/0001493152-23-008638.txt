Overview
 
Wireless Telecom Group, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, together with its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”), is pursuing strategic alternatives to accelerate the realization of value for our shareholders. On January 1, 2022, the Company was comprised of Wireless Telecom Group, Inc., doing business as, and operating under the trade name NoiseCom, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries including Boonton Electronics Corporation, Microlab/FXR LLC, Wireless Telecommunications Group Ltd., CommAgility Limited and Holzworth Instrumentation, Inc. (NoiseCom, Inc., Boonton Electronics Corporation, Microlab/FXR LLC, CommAgility Limited Ltd., and Holzworth Instrumentation, Inc. are hereinafter referred to as “Noisecom”, “Boonton”, “Microlab”, “CommAgility” and “Holzworth”, respectively). Our product groups were organized as follows: Radio Frequency Components (“RFC”) was comprised of our Microlab brand; Radio, Baseband, Software (“RBS”) was comprised of our CommAgility brand; and Test and Measurement (“T&M”) was comprised of our Boonton, Noisecom and Holzworth brands.
 
As more fully described under Divestitures below, on March 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Microlab to RF Industries, Ltd and on December 30, 2022 completed the sale of CommAgility to E-Space Acquisitions, LLC. Subsequent to the divestitures of Microlab and CommAgility, the Company is comprised of the T&M business, which is made up of our Boonton, Noisecom and Holzworth brands. The T&M business provides radio frequency (“RF”) and microwave test equipment and low phase noise RF synthesizers to equipment manufacturers, aerospace and defense companies, military and government agencies, satellite communication companies, semiconductor companies and other global technology companies.
 
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the results of Microlab and CommAgility are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations. Further, the Company reclassified the assets and liabilities of Microlab and CommAgility as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued operations. Our consolidated financial statements from continuing operations include the accounts of Noisecom, Boonton and Holzworth.
 
Divestiture of Microlab and CommAgility
 
On December 16, 2021, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary Microlab entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Microlab Purchase Agreement”) with RF Industries, Ltd., a Nevada corporation (the “Buyer” or “RF Industries”) whereby the Buyer agreed to purchase 100% of the membership interests in Microlab for a purchase price of $24,250,000, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Microlab Purchase Agreement. The board of directors of each of the Company and the Buyer unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the “Microlab Transaction”). On February 25, 2022, the shareholders of the Company approved the Microlab Transaction at a Special Meeting of Shareholders held virtually via live webcast and on March 1, 2022, the Transaction closed.
 
At closing the Company received approximately $22.8 million in proceeds net of indemnification and purchase price adjustment holdbacks of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively, and direct expenses of approximately $1.1 million including fees to our advisors. In July 2022, the Company received $225,000 in final purchase price adjustment primarily related to the working capital adjustment and, on March 1, 2023, the Company received the indemnification holdback amount of $150,000. In total, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $23.1 million related to the Microlab Transaction. In 2022, the Company used $4.2 million of the Microlab Transaction proceeds to repay in full our outstanding term loan with Muzinich BDC and approximately $600,000 was used to repay in full our outstanding revolver balance related to the Bank of America credit agreement. The Company terminated both the Muzinich term loan and Bank of America credit facility as of the Microlab Transaction date. Additionally, concurrent with the closing, the Company entered into a sublease with RF Industries, Ltd for approximately one-half of the square footage of our corporate headquarters in Parsippany, NJ.
 
On December 4, 2022, the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Wireless Telecommunications Group, Ltd, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“Holdings”), which owns 100% of the outstanding securities of CommAgility, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “CommAgility Purchase Agreement”) with E-Space Acquisitions LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Buyer” or “E-Space”), and eSpace Inc., a Delaware corporation, as guarantor. The CommAgility Purchase Agreement provided for the purchase by the Buyer of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Holdings (the “Securities”) from the Company. The board of directors or other governing body of each of the Company and the Buyer unanimously approved the CommAgility Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the “CommAgility Transaction”). Under the terms of the CommAgility Purchase Agreement, the purchase price for the Securities was estimated to be approximately $14.5 million, inclusive of $13.8 million in cash consideration and a $750,000 note payable, under which the note was subject to agreed-upon reductions of $650,000.

The CommAgility Transaction closed on December 30, 2022 and the Company received net proceeds of $12.2 million which is comprised of the cash consideration of $13.8 million less direct expenses of approximately $1.6 million. The note payable of $750,000 has been offset by agreed-upon reductions of $650,000 for a net balance due of approximately $100,000 which is due one year from the date of the CommAgility Transaction closing or upon a change in control as defined in the CommAgility Purchase Agreement. The note receivable balance of $100,000 has been further offset by the 2023 UK transaction taxes of approximately $69,000 and the expected net proceeds of the note is approximately $31,000.
 
The CommAgility Transaction and Microlab Transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $35.3 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, subsequent to both the CommAgility Transaction and Microlab Transaction the Company had a cash balance of $20.7 million with no debt or earnout liabilities. The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives for the remaining T&M business. We do not expect to comment further or update the market with any additional information on the process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or otherwise deems disclosure appropriate or necessary. There can be no assurance that the evaluation of strategic alternatives will result in any strategic alternative transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing.
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 2022 exclude the results of Microlab and CommAgility for all periods presented. The results of Microlab and CommAgility have been recorded as discontinued operations in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Further, the assets and liabilities of Microlab and CommAgility have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021.

Backlog
 
The Company’s consolidated backlog of firm orders to be shipped in the next twelve months was approximately $6.6 million at December 31, 2022, compared to approximately $5.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in backlog is due to higher order flow in the second half of fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year. Management anticipates that the majority of the backlog orders at December 31, 2022 will be filled during the current year. The stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of Company revenues for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that the Company will realize a profit from the orders.
Inventory, Supplies and Manufacturing
 
The Company purchases electronic components, diodes, aluminum housings and printed wiring assemblies from domestic suppliers. The Company’s procurement policy requires maintaining adequate levels of raw materials inventory to minimize the Company’s production lead times with third-party suppliers and to improve the Company’s capacity to expedite fulfillment of customer orders. During 2022 and 2021, the Company experienced component shortages and longer lead times from suppliers. Although there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements in 2022 or 2021 as a result of supply chain disruptions, continued component shortages or extended lead times in the future may have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations. Two suppliers accounting for approximately 33% and 37% of consolidated inventory purchases for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
The Company is not party to any long-term contracts regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. We generally purchase such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.
 
For Boonton and Noisecom products, the Company develops, designs, manufactures, assembles, calibrates and tests the products at our facility in Parsippany, New Jersey. Testing of Boonton and Noisecom products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes.
 
Holzworth products are designed, developed, assembled and tested in our facility in Boulder, Colorado.
 
Warranty and Service
 
The Company typically provides one to three year warranties on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers.
 
In cases of defective products the customer typically returns them to the Company’s facility. The Company’s service personnel typically repair the defective items and ship them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company’s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. If the defective product cannot be repaired, the Company typically replaces the product free of charge but unrepairable products are an infrequent occurrence.
 
Product Liability Coverage
 
The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability to the Company. Product liability claims could be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company’s products. The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage. No claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device in the past five years.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property, including its methodologies, is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely primarily on trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. All employees are subject to the Company’s policies to ensure that all of the Company’s intellectual property and business information are maintained in confidence. Key employees have signed non-disclosure and non-competition agreements.
Regulation
 
Environmental
 
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
 
As a result of the Microlab divestiture, the Company filed a General Information Notice with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) for our corporate headquarters in Parsippany, N.J. in accordance with the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”). Additionally, the Company engaged a Licensed Site Remediation Professional (“LSRP”) to perform a Preliminary Assessment (“PA”) and Site Investigation (“SI”) in accordance with the provisions of ISRA. In accordance with ISRA, in February 2022, the Company posted a $100,000 letter of credit with the NJDEP. The PA identified several areas requiring further environmental investigation which were addressed as part of the SI report.
 
In December 2022, the Company received the SI report from the LSRP. The SI report identified several areas requiring additional investigation most notably elevated concentrations of hazardous substances in the groundwater that were above state and federal limits. The SI report also stated that the groundwater contamination predates our occupancy at our headquarters. We engaged our LSRP to perform additional testing in the first quarter of 2023 to further refine the Company’s understanding of the contamination. As a result of the testing performed in the first quarter of 2023, it is suspected that the groundwater contamination originated from an offsite source. Further testing is being conducted to validate the findings.
 
As the Company believes that hazardous substances in soil and groundwater at our Parsippany headquarters predate our occupancy and/or were caused by unrelated third parties, we believe that others, and not the Company, should be responsible for the cost of remediation. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in absolving the Company of the remediation liability. Based on our reasonable position that we did not cause the contamination we do not think our potential liability would be material.
 
In fiscal 2022 the Company incurred approximately $140,000 in expenses related to testing and assessments associated with ISRA which are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not accrued a liability related to the estimated remediation expenses due to the fact that the Company does not believe it should be ultimately responsible for the remediation.
 
Workplace Safety
 
The Company’s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health. The Company believes it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
 
ITAR and Export Controls
 
Certain of the Company’s products may be subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. ITAR requires export licenses from the U.S. Department of State for products shipped outside the U.S. that have military or strategic applications. Because some of the Company’s products could have military or strategic applications, it must ensure its compliance with ITAR.
 
In addition, the Company is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, which regulates the export of certain “dual use” items and technologies and, in some instances, requires a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce in connection with sales of the Company’s products.
 
The Company believes it is in material compliance with all such export regulations.

-

FAR and DFARS
 
Certain of the Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (“FAR”) regarding government procurement. Further, certain of the Company’s contracts are subject to the IT security requirements of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”) for controlled unclassified information.
 
The Company believes it is in material compliance with applicable requirements of FAR and DFARS.
 
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
 
The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (“CMMC”) framework is designed to protect Federal Contract Information (“FCI”) and Controlled Unclassified Information (“CUI”) that is handled, stored and/or processed by Defense Industrial Base contractors and is being implemented to further protect the mission of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”). CMMC applies to all DOD contractors and anyone in the defense contract supply chain. Certain of our contracts with the defense subcontractors or direct with the U.S Government may require compliance with CMMC. The original timeline for implementation of CMMC was based on a five-year phased rollout schedule. The Company is in the process of completing self-assessments to comply with CMMC.
Human Capital
 
The Company is not subject to collective bargaining agreements and considers its relationship with its employees to be good. Subsequent to the Microlab and CommAgility divestitures, on March 1, 2023, the Company has 68 total full-time employees.
Investor Information
 
The Company is subject to the disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.
 
You can access financial and other information, including copies of our recent SEC filings, at the Company’s Investor Relations page on its website. The address of the website is www.wirelesstelecomgroup.com.
