Item 1.    Business.
Overview
Loyalty Ventures Inc. (“Loyalty Ventures,” “we,” or “our”) is a leading provider of tech-enabled, data-driven consumer loyalty solutions. Our solutions are focused on helping partners achieve their strategic and financial objectives, from increased consumer basket size, shopper traffic and frequency and digital reach to enhanced program reporting and analytics. We help financial services providers, retailers and other consumer-facing businesses create and increase customer loyalty across multiple touch points from traditional to digital to mobile and emerging technologies. We own and operate the AIR MILES® Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and BrandLoyalty, a leading global provider of campaign-based loyalty solutions for grocers and other high-frequency retailers.
The AIR MILES Reward Program is an end-to-end loyalty platform, combining technology, data/analytics and other solutions to help our clients (who we call sponsors) drive increased engagement by consumers (who we call collectors) with their brand. The AIR MILES Reward Program operates as a full-service coalition loyalty program for our sponsors. We provide marketing, customer service, rewards and redemption management for our sponsors. We typically grant sponsors exclusivity in their market category, enabling them to realize incremental sales and increase market share as a result of their participation in the AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program enables collectors to earn AIR MILES reward miles as they shop across a broad range of sponsors from financial institutions, grocery and liquor, e-commerce, specialty retail, pharmacy, petroleum retail, and home furnishings to hardware, that participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program. These AIR MILES reward miles can be redeemed by collectors for travel, entertainment, experiences, merchandise or other rewards. Through our AIR MILES cash program option, collectors can also instantly redeem their AIR MILES reward miles earned in the AIR MILES cash program option toward in-store purchases at participating sponsors, such as Shell Canada.
BrandLoyalty is a worldwide leader in campaign-based loyalty solutions that positively impact consumer behavior on a mass scale. We pride ourselves on being a business with purpose by connecting high-frequency retailers, supplier partners and consumers to create sustainable solutions for today’s challenges. We design, implement, conduct and evaluate innovative, digitally enhanced, tailor-made loyalty campaigns. These campaigns are tailored for the specific client and are designed to reward key customer segments based on their spending levels during defined campaign periods. At BrandLoyalty, we aim to let shoppers feel emotionally connected when they shop at our clients, by designing campaigns with the right mechanics and rewards that instantly change shopping behavior and engender loyalty. The rewards we offer come from top brands with high creative standards such as Disney, Zwilling, and vivo | Villeroy & Boch.
Spin-off Transaction
On October 13, 2021, the Board of Directors of Alliance Data Systems Corporation (“ADS” or “Parent”) approved the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) of its LoyaltyOne segment, consisting of its Canadian AIR MILES® Reward Program and BrandLoyalty businesses, into an independent, publicly traded company, Loyalty Ventures Inc. (“Loyalty Ventures”). On November 5, 2021, the date of the Separation, 81% of the outstanding shares of Loyalty Ventures were distributed pro rata based on the outstanding shares of ADS common stock at the close of business on the record date of October 27, 2021, with ADS retaining the remaining 19% of the outstanding shares of Loyalty Ventures. ADS stockholders of record that did not sell their rights to receive Loyalty Ventures stock before the close of business on November 5, 2021 received one share of Loyalty Ventures common stock for every two and one-half (2.5) shares of ADS common stock. Additionally, Loyalty Ventures made a cash distribution of $750.0 million to ADS on November 3, 2021 as part of the Separation. The distribution qualified as a tax-free reorganization and a tax-free distribution to ADS and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On November 8, 2021, “regular-way” trading of Loyalty Ventures’ common stock began on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “LYLT”.
​
We entered into several agreements with ADS that govern the relationship of the parties following the Separation, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement 

4



("TSA"), and the Employee Matters Agreement. Under the terms of the TSA, ADS agreed to provide certain corporate, administrative and information technology services for periods up to 18 months, certain of which may be extended for an additional six-month period. See Note 1, “Description of Business, Spinoff and Basis of Presentation,” of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding these agreements. 
​
Strategy
Our goal is to accelerate stakeholder value creation through the continued development of loyalty platforms for the tech-forward business and consumer era. We intend to pursue a variety of new omnichannel initiatives, including expanding geographies and verticals; further enriching tech and analytic capabilities; employing sustainable solutions; and seeking additional strategic partnerships.
Attract new clients and grow existing client base
The AIR MILES Reward Program continues to focus on broadening our sponsor base and expanding the network effects of the coalition. We seek to attract new sponsors and deepen existing relationships by enhancing our solutions portfolio. Deployment of enriched marketing and advertising capabilities will further sponsors’ ability to reach and engage collectors, increasing the value proposition for sponsors and reward suppliers alike. Diversifying the sponsor network, including expansion to non-traditional partnerships and alliances, including new arrangements with business-to-business e-commerce platforms that enable smaller, local e-commerce partners to incorporate AIR MILES reward miles in their promotional activities, will allow for a stronger and broader ecosystem to capture a larger portion of total consumer spend within the AIR MILES Reward Program. A core advantage to being a part of the AIR MILES Reward Program is the benefit to each partner as the coalition expands.
Similarly, we believe there is market opportunity for BrandLoyalty to grow its client base by adding new grocers in existing markets. Additional opportunity exists in the form of diversification into adjacent segments, such as convenience stores and pharmacies, which are a natural fit for BrandLoyalty due to the high frequency and spend profile of the customer base. Further expansion into new growing verticals like e-commerce and food delivery is also expected to present significant opportunities.
By diversifying and growing our ability to integrate advanced data analytics with marketing and loyalty services, we seek to position ourselves to serve the modern consumer, thus increasing the value proposition for our clients by delivering long-term integrated growth opportunities and ultimately delivering returns for our stakeholders.
Invest in technology to better engage consumers
The AIR MILES Reward Program continues to focus on driving collector engagement to enhance the benefit to the entire coalition of sponsors. The AIR MILES Reward Program has focused on enhancing digital initiatives targeting younger demographic channels as well as the broader collector base as a whole. By providing in-store and mobile access and increasing the relevancy of personalized, targeted, real-time offers, the AIR MILES Reward Program is improving effectiveness of digital campaigns and overall collector engagement. We will continue to invest in technology to deliver new digital products and solutions to improve collector engagement and the sponsor value proposition. An expansive collector and sponsor base results in an expanding database, which can be used to create and monetize new and innovative supplemental solutions for all partners of the ecosystem.
BrandLoyalty has built a first-class technology platform and array of digital tools, including the Bright Loyalty Platform, the Analytical Framework, StorePal and other features to support its campaign-based loyalty solutions. The Analytical Framework provides full-cycle loyalty program design, real-time feedback and evaluation to adjust programs in progress or apply learnings to future designs. BrandLoyalty’s Bright Loyalty Platform provides shoppers the ability to collect and share points digitally, earn badges, play games, view leaderboards and level up to achieve better status and more exclusive perks. BrandLoyalty also offers StorePal to directly support in-store staff with program execution through state-of-the-art AI analysis and collaboration to improve in-store marketing, display placement, staff program knowledge and stock availability.

We believe opportunities exist to leverage the digital loyalty capabilities of BrandLoyalty’s platform and the highly advanced data science platform of the AIR MILES Reward Program to enhance the digital tools and capabilities of both businesses.
Expand into new geographies
We will seek to expand our geographic reach to accelerate growth. Our client-centered approach and the almost 30-year operating history of our businesses has resulted in unique, rich shopper and market data, which we use to generate insights for brands globally. There is substantial opportunity to serve untapped markets across the globe, which will serve as a growth lever in the near-term and solidify sustainable sources of future revenue going forward. In the near term, BrandLoyalty expects to increase its presence in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Nordic region. We also intend to enhance our product offerings and geographic footprint through opportunistic acquisitions that complement our business. We will consider select acquisition opportunities that expand the breadth of our product portfolio, enhance our market positioning and accelerate our presence in attractive geographies, while maintaining alignment with our culture.
Segments
Our business is managed and reported as two segments: the AIR MILES Reward Program segment and the BrandLoyalty segment, which provide coalitions and campaign-based loyalty programs, respectively, as described more fully below. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas appears in Note 23, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 
The AIR MILES Reward Program
The AIR MILES Reward Program is an end-to-end loyalty platform, combining technology, data and analytics and other solutions to help our sponsors drive increased engagement by collectors with their brand. The AIR MILES Reward Program operates as a full-service outsourced coalition loyalty program for our sponsors, who pay us a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued, in return for which we provide all marketing, customer service, rewards and redemption management. The AIR MILES Reward Program enables collectors to earn AIR MILES reward miles as they shop across a broad range of retailers and other sponsors participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program provides a wide range of rewards from leisure and entertainment to merchandise, flight, travel and unique experiences with over 1,000 reward options that appeal to an expansive set of collectors. Through our AIR MILES Cash program option, collectors can also instantly redeem their AIR MILES reward miles collected in the AIR MILES Cash program option toward in-store purchases at participating sponsors. 
Sponsors
We have over 100 brand name sponsors that participate in our AIR MILES Reward Program, including Shell Canada Products, Jean Coutu, Amex Bank of Canada, Sobeys Inc. and Bank of Montreal. Our sponsor base covers a diverse set of market spend categories, including gas, pharmacy, credit card, and grocery. Relationships with our largest and most well-known sponsors account for a significant portion of our consolidated and combined revenue, including approximately 17% from Bank of Montreal for the year ended December 31, 2021. We typically grant participating sponsors exclusivity in their market category, enabling them to realize incremental sales and increase market share as a result of their participation in the AIR MILES Reward Program. 
Collectors
Collectors can accumulate AIR MILES reward miles across a significant portion of their everyday spend and can earn AIR MILES reward miles at thousands of in-store and online retail and service locations, including through our AIR MILES Reward Program eCommerce site. Collectors can also earn AIR MILES reward miles at any locations where they are permitted to use certain credit cards issued by Bank of Montreal and Amex Bank of Canada. Collectors can redeem AIR MILES reward miles through multiple channels, including in-lane cash redemptions, online cash 

6



redemptions through our mobile app and online. We utilize these multiple channels to enable collectors to redeem for the rewards they desire in the physical and digital locations they frequent.
As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 10 million collectors in the AIR MILES Reward Program.
Suppliers
We enter into agreements with airlines, supplier platforms and other providers to supply rewards for the AIR MILES Reward Program. The broad range of rewards that can be redeemed is one of the reasons the AIR MILES Reward Program remains popular with collectors and collectors continue to engage in the program. Hundreds of brands use the AIR MILES Reward Program as an additional distribution channel for these products. Suppliers include well-recognized companies in diverse industries, including travel, hospitality, electronics and entertainment.
Loyalty platform
We provide a fully managed loyalty platform that helps our sponsors by driving traffic, understanding key trends and maximizing loyalty return on investment. We provide full management of all loyalty program services and capabilities with instant issuance at point of sale and instant cash redemption at point of sale (with real-time enabled connection), along with diverse merchandise and travel rewards management, a full-service Customer Care team (employees answer questions in English & French through voice, chat and social media channels) and plug and play through ready-to-integrate application programming interfaces, or APIs.
We use data management and analytics to integrate a vast set of consumer information and turn it into meaningful collector insights which (i) engage key segments with targeted, relevant communications with our sponsors, (ii) create predictive models to enhance lifetime value throughout the customer lifecycle, and (iii) integrate directly with marketing channels for personalized experiences. These management and analytics services help Sponsors understand and optimize loyalty performance. We provide dedicated teams to help operate the program and deliver deep insights with reporting and analytics solutions to understand program performance and contribution and to monitor program and customer health. We also use traditional and AI-powered marketing tools to reach and engage collectors across multiple channels.
Our data and technology stack provides solutions based on agility, versatility, scalability and security.
BrandLoyalty
BrandLoyalty is a leading global provider of campaign-based loyalty solutions providing tailor-made programs to leading grocery and other high frequency retailers. Our customers pay us a fee, based on the number of redemptions, to create and implement customized campaigns designed to increase consumer traffic and develop consumer loyalty and long-term relationships. These campaigns are targeted at segments with the aim to increase the share of wallet for our customer by providing stamps for a certain spent amount which can ultimately be redeemed by the consumer for highly collectible rewards and are designed to generate traffic growth and increase basket size for our customer. The campaign-based loyalty programs typically last between 6 and 20 weeks, depending on the nature of the program, with contract terms usually less than one year in length. These programs are tailored for the specific retailer client and are designed to reward key customer segments based on their spending levels during defined campaign periods.
Customers
 In 2021, we had approximately 145 retailers as our customers, operating on six continents in approximately 45 countries. Europe and Asia represented our largest presence, with campaigns also offered in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Nordic regions. Many of our customers are leading grocery retailers in their respective countries.
Brand suppliers
BrandLoyalty manages a broad portfolio of premium reward suppliers balanced between exclusive contracts, licenses and proprietary suppliers that are globally relevant and recognized brand suppliers. These suppliers offer highly 

7



desirable rewards, encouraging long-term consumer loyalty, and the portfolio approach ensures we can offer the optimal reward proposition for the targeted consumer segment at the right economics.
Tech-enabled solutions
Our Analytical Framework supports our customer throughout the end-to-end campaign design by identifying the right campaign type with the right mechanics during the campaign preparation, by providing predictions and insights on campaigns in execution and by evaluating finished campaigns. It provides real-time feedback and evaluation to adjust programs in progress or apply learnings to future designs.
Our Bright Loyalty Platform is a cloud-based loyalty solution that provides our customers with a plug and play solution to run digital loyalty solutions, enabling new ways of interacting such as instant promotions and digital stamp collection. It provides shoppers the ability to collect and share points digitally, earn badges, play games, view leaderboards and level up to achieve better status and more exclusive perks.
StorePal is a digital tool that provides retailers AI-enabled insights on store level campaign execution benefitting campaign performance and consumer engagement through in-store marketing, display placement, staff program knowledge and stock availability.
Competition
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We compete with advertising and other promotional and loyalty programs, both traditional and online, for a portion of a client’s total marketing budget, as well as with the in-house staffs of our current and potential clients. In the campaign-based loyalty program market, we have both global and, in certain geographies, regional competitors with the most significant being TCC Global N.V.
Seasonality
Our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by promotional activity by our sponsors, timing of campaign-based loyalty programs in market as well as increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter.
Disaster and Contingency Planning
​
We operate, either internally or through third-party service providers, multiple data processing centers to process and store our customer transaction data. Given the significant amount of data that we or our third-party service providers manage, much of which is real-time data to support our clients’ commerce initiatives, we have established redundant capabilities for our data centers. We have a number of safeguards in place that are designed to protect us from data-related risks and in the event of a disaster, to restore our data centers’ systems.
​
Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
​
We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in each segment of our business. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States and Canada, although we also have either registered trademarks or applications pending for certain marks in other countries. No individual patent or license is material to us or our segments other than that we are the exclusive Canadian licensee of the AIR MILES family of trademarks pursuant to a perpetual license agreement with Diversified Royalty Corp., for which we pay a 

8



royalty fee. We believe that the AIR MILES family of trademarks and our other trademarks are important for our branding, corporate identification and marketing of our services in each business segment.
​
We own or have rights to use trademarks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business, which appear throughout this Form 10-K. Solely for convenience, we may not use the ™ or ® symbols every time the trademark/trade name is mentioned. We may also refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.
​
Regulation
​
Data protection and consumer privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve, increasing restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate collector or customer information. In addition, the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer or public or private sector privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services, including placing restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally permissible.
The rapid development of new privacy regulations and the evolution of existing data protection requirements around the globe and penalties for noncompliance may impose additional compliance and operational requirements and increase our cost to serve in the form of organizational changes, implementation of new technologies, employee training and engaging consultants. Such requirements may require us to modify or restrict our data processing practices and policies and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, damages, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
For further information related to regulation, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Human capital
Our people form the core of our business, and we want our people to enjoy the journey. Our ability to build value for our sponsors, collectors and our clients and their consumers as well as our stockholders depends on the performance of our more than 1,400 employees in 20 countries around the world as of December 31, 2021. To facilitate talent acquisition and retention, we strive to make Loyalty Ventures a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment, with a strong culture and opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers while being supported by competitive compensation and benefit programs.
Culture
Loyalty Ventures benefits from the blend of the vibrant cultures of the AIR MILES Reward Program and BrandLoyalty. 
The unique culture at the AIR MILES Reward Program comes from the collaboration, dedication, and fun their teams bring to work every day. Their pride and passion are felt across the organization from leadership to new hires on their first day, and this is engrained in everything they do, all with a focus on delivering results for their clients, engaging their customers and empowering their employees. In addition, the AIR MILES Reward Program enables sponsors, collectors and employees alike to create lasting social and environmental change in Canadian communities through its impact strategy, consisting of four pillars that include environment; giving back; diversity, equity and inclusion; and social impact. We invest time and energy to ensure these pillars are engrained in the business goals of our organization.
At BrandLoyalty, our people are at the core of our business. Employees at BrandLoyalty are entrepreneurial and responsible, eager to stay ahead of the curve, anticipating new trends and driving innovation. Their enthusiasm stimulates our ability to grow. BrandLoyalty’s culture is defined by its values, creating an invisible cord that binds a 

9



multinational business. BrandLoyalty’s value pillars of connected, original, responsible and dynamic create next generation happiness for our clients and their consumers across the globe. BrandLoyalty believes that by being consumer-driven, we can best help our clients, that by growing our business, we can attract and retain the best employees, that by developing our talent, we can create better solutions, that by improving daily life, we can be meaningful to our consumers, and that by giving our best, opening minds, touching hearts, appealing to individuals separate from the masses and having fun, we can make people happy. Our values turn our ambitions into action, to create next-generation happiness. BrandLoyalty loves happy people. 
In addition, Loyalty Ventures’ code of ethics remains central to our expectation that employees embody our values and, as such, every new hire and annually every employee is required to certify to their understanding of, and adherence to, the code of ethics.
Diversity, equity & inclusion
We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I) is important to our continued success and our ability to serve our sponsors, collectors, clients and their consumers. The AIR MILES Reward Program set out on building an explicit and focused approach to DE&I by first reviewing its processes, team structures and operating practices. The AIR MILES Reward Program worked across the business to identify where inclusion and accessibility might drive value and innovation, and how to embed it into workplace culture. Understanding inclusion is a journey, not a destination, and in 2021 the AIR MILES Reward Program engaged a third-party consultant to assist its cross-functional leadership team to further its strategy development and action plans for DE&I. Further, more than half of the AIR MILES Reward Program employees have engaged in foundational e-learning coursework in this area. At BrandLoyalty, we continuously initiate and support projects to further grow as an organization on DE&I. For example, our ‘culture and connect’ project team is raising awareness around DE&I throughout the year and we’ve redesigned the hiring process to provide equal opportunities and improve diversity in all teams. We continuously train our people on awareness and unconscious bias and how to improve awareness, encourage multi-disciplinary teams, and celebrate the important holidays of our various nationalities. Above all, we believe that “diversity is only a word, if we are not being inclusive.”
Talent development and retention
We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our people, as well as retaining these talented employees as a key component of operating a successful business with a vibrant culture. 
Our AIR MILES Reward Program provides a comprehensive year-round training calendar led by internal and external experts, focused on developing skills, capabilities, leadership fundamentals and aspiring leaders. Additionally, the AIR MILES Reward Program supports its employees with continuing formal education and provides a tuition reimbursement, up to a set amount per calendar year, for the cost of courses and required educational material at accredited colleges or universities. 
BrandLoyalty is committed to identifying and developing the talents of our people, as well as retaining them. All new colleagues participate in a unique online onboarding program to not only get a jump start into the core of the business but also to immediately grasp the culture of collaboration and teamwork. Further, our internally developed BrandLoyalty University takes care of developing relevant business and market knowledge and also offers a wide range of professional and personal development opportunities throughout our people’s career paths. For every functional group, we have a unique learning curriculum for all employees at all levels. 
In addition to career-oriented training and development, across Loyalty Ventures, we require annual employee training to ensure ongoing adherence to responsible business practices and ethical conduct.
Compensation
We believe the structure of our compensation and benefit programs provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We provide pay that, together with benefits, is competitive and aligns across employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location.
