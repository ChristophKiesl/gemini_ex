 Overview 
         Global Power and its wholly owned subsidiaries are comprehensive providers of custom-engineered solutions and modification and maintenance services for customers in the energy and industrial markets. As of December 31, 2015, customers were located inside and outside the United States (the "U.S."), in both developed and emerging economies. 
         We design, engineer and manufacture a comprehensive range of gas and steam turbine products, control houses and generator enclosures primarily used to enhance the efficiency and facilitate the operation of power plants and other industrial, energy and power-related applications. We believe our customer relationships built over many years, the reliability and performance of our solutions, our ability to deliver complex, engineered solutions, our advanced engineering and execution capabilities, our worldwide manufacturing base and our leading installed base of equipment throughout the world have supported key parts of our business. 
         We provide on-site maintenance and modification services, outage management and craft labor, facility upgrade services, specialty coatings and roofing, asbestos and lead abatement, specialty aluminum welding, repair and maintenance of brazed aluminum heat exchangers and other industrial and safety services to nuclear, fossil-fuel, industrial gas and liquefied natural gas, petrochemical and other industrial operations in the U.S. Subsequent to the date of this report, we sold our Hetsco business, which engaged in certain of these services. For additional information, see "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events." We have the capability to combine our resources to offer solutions for aftermarket repair applications for the North American gas turbine power generation, petrochemical and cogeneration markets. 
         Including our predecessor entities, we have over 50 years of experience providing custom-engineered products that are critical for the operation of power plants and more than 32 years of experience providing complex outage shutdown services to operators of nuclear power plants and other industrial maintenance services. 
         We use the Braden, Consolidated Fabricators, Williams, Koontz-Wagner, IBI Power, TOG Manufacturing and Hetsco trade names and the logos for each of those businesses and for Global Power. These trade names and logos are the property of Global Power. Product names and company programs appearing throughout this Form 10-K are trademarks of Global Power. This Form 10-K also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. Subsequent to the date of this report, we sold two of our legal entities that 
 10

   maintained some of the intellectual property assets described. For additional information, see "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events." 
         Global Power was incorporated in 2001 under the laws of the State of Delaware and became the successor to GEEG Holdings, LLC, which was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1998. We and all of our U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on September 28, 2006 and successfully emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to an approved Plan of Reorganization on January 22, 2008. Upon emergence, we issued 5,266,885 shares of our new common stock to pre-petition equity holders in exchange for stock held before the bankruptcy. On that same date, pursuant to a rights offering, a private placement and related backstop and our Management Incentive Co-Investment Plan, we issued an additional 9,589,138 shares of our new common stock in exchange for $72.5 million in net proceeds. The applicable price of our common stock in the rights offering was $7.65 per share. As part of the plan, we also entered into a $150.0 million credit facility (the "Previous Credit Facility"). In June 2011, we received a court order for final decree closing the Chapter 11 Filing. 
   Segments 
         In determining our reportable segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280Segment Reporting ("ASC 280"), we concluded that, until January 2015, we operated in three reportable segments: Product Solutions, Nuclear Services and Energy Services. 
         In January 2015, we announced the integration of our four operating segments (hereinafter referred to as "operating units") into two reportable segments, structured around products and services, as part of our ongoing streamlining efforts. However, in re-evaluating our reportable segments as of the end of 2015, we determined that, while we continue to believe the projected long-term economic similarities between our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions operating units support aggregation into a single reportable segment, there has been disparity in the historical operating results to date between those two operating units. As such, we believe it is currently more meaningful to the reader to report segment information on those operating units separately and, therefore, concluded we have three reportable segments: Mechanical Solutions, Electrical Solutions and Services. The segment information for prior periods has been adjusted retrospectively to conform to the current period presentation. Our three reportable segments have operated as described below. 
   Mechanical Solutions Segment
        This reportable segment is comprised of Braden Manufacturing, LLC ("Braden"), Braden Europe, B.V. ("Braden Europe"), Consolidated Fabricators ("CFI") and TOG Manufacturing Company, Inc. ("TOG"). Mechanical Solutions focuses on filter houses, inlet and exhaust systems, diverter dampers, selective catalytic reduction systems (commonly referred to as "SCR"), auxiliary control skids and enclosures, expansion joints, air filtration elements, retrofit and upgrade solutions and specialty machined parts. Our Mechanical Solutions segment designs, engineers, manufactures, installs, commissions and services for the worldwide power generation markets. Our principal customers are utility-scale gas turbine original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), Owner/Operators, Electric Utilities and engineering, procurement and contractor ("EPC") firms. We also provide precision parts, replacement parts, filter elements and aftermarket retrofit equipment to both OEMs and end users. Our solutions are custom-engineered to meet project and customer-specific requirements. 
         Our technical and engineering capabilities enable us to design and manufacture a broad range of power plant and other industrial equipment to meet each customer's specific performance 
 11

   requirements. We provide the following comprehensive range of solutions critical to the operation of power plants: 
 

 Inlet Systems.  Inlet systems are comprised of filter houses and air intake
ducts that condition the air entering the turbine or engine (pulse-type or barrier filtration, temperature and moisture control, flow distribution and pressure drop optimization) and provide
acoustical treatment for noise generated by the gas turbine air flow. 
 Exhaust Systems.  Exhaust systems, including diffusers, plenums, ducts and
stacks, expansion joints and diverter dampers, direct the hot exhaust from the turbine, with silencing provided as well, to the atmosphere in the case of simple cycle operation or into a heat recovery
steam generator ("HRSG") when the power plant is operated as a combined cycle facility. 
 Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems.  SCR systems are used in simple cycle
gas turbine facilities and are focused on removing oxides of nitrogen and carbon and other volatiles from exhaust gas. 
 Custom-Engineered Equipment Skids.  Custom-engineered, pre-packaged
equipment skids, either enclosed or open to the elements, with or without HVAC, can be used for a wide variety of industrial equipment applications, allowing faster and lower cost equipment
installation at a customer's industrial site. 

         The contracts under which we sell our products are typically fixed-price contracts, most of which are "lump sum bid" contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we bid against other suppliers based on customer or project specifications. Many of our project destinations are outside the U.S. 
         Historically, Mechanical Solutions fabricated equipment through a combination of in-house manufacturing at our own facilities in the U.S. and Mexico and outsourced manufacturing in other countries around the world. However, beginning in 2016, all of our Mechanical Solutions businesses, except CFI, began exclusively using outsourced manufacturing facilities. Our network of high-quality international manufacturing partners, located in more than 20 countries, allows us to manufacture equipment worldwide and maintain a competitive cost structure. Outsourcing our gas turbine auxiliary product manufacturing enables us to meet increasing demand without internal manufacturing capacity limitations, reduces our capital expenditure requirements and allows us to respond to the particular sourcing initiatives of our customers, whether those initiatives call for global sourcing or for localized supply content. Our employees work closely with our international manufacturing partners to supervise the fabrication of our products at their facilities to ensure high levels of quality and workmanship. While we generally have proven, long-term relationships with our subcontractors, we also routinely search for additional subcontractors to enhance our ability to manufacture equipment at the lowest cost while maintaining high-quality standards and on-time delivery. 
         We maintain agreements with key third-party fabricators, many of which require OEM approval. We conduct regular quality audits of our fabricators and, in some cases, maintain staff on-site. Subcontractors can sometimes take several years to qualify to meet our requirements and international standards, including OEM audit and approval. 
         For information about the impact of certain business divestitures that occurred after the date of this report, see "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events."

fully integrated fabricated metal buildings that house electrical power and control equipment, namely switchgear, motor control centers, variable frequency drives and utilities for the power
generation, oil and gas processing and refining (midstream and downstream), industrial, utility and renewables market segments. 
 Generator Enclosure Packages and Sub-Base Tanks.  Custom-engineered and
designed generator enclosure packages are fabricated metal buildings that are often sound attenuated and designed to meet site certification, visual, environmental, functional, size and sound
requirements. The enclosure packages are used to house both prime and standby diesel/natural gas generators that range from 30 KW to 4,000 KW in a wide range of environments, from desert to arctic, in
a fully integrated package, including all necessary systems for an operating generator package. Also offered are sub-base and stand-alone tanks meeting the safety standards of UL LLC, an
American safety consulting and certification company, including UL LLC listings UL 142, UL 2085 and ULC-S601. 

         The contracts under which we sell our products are fixed-price contracts, most of which are "lump sum bid" contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we bid against other suppliers based on customer or project specifications. Our project destinations are primarily in the U.S. 
         Electrical Solutions continues to leverage its geographically broad North American manufacturing footprint to provide control houses, custom-engineered equipment skids and generator packages throughout the western hemisphere. 
   Services Segment
        This reportable segment is comprised of Hetsco and Williams Industrial Services, LLC ("WIS" and, collectively with Williams Plant Services, LLC and Williams Specialty Services, LLC, the "Williams business"). Our Services segment provides a comprehensive range of modification, maintenance and construction support services for nuclear power plants and a wide range of utilities and industrial customers, including fossil fuel, industrial gas, liquified natural gas, petrochemical and other industrial operations. We provide these services primarily on a direct hire basis, where we manage and perform the work ourselves, but we also act in a general contracting capacity where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on the project. We primarily service U.S.-based plants and perform tasks designed to improve or sustain the operating efficiencies. As of December 31, 2015, a portion of our Services segment generated revenue from offshore repairs of installed aluminum heat exchangers, primarily in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The services provided by our Services segment are designed to improve or sustain operating efficiencies and extend the useful lives of process equipment. We provide these services both on a constant presence basis and for discrete projects.

of asbestos and heavy metal based coatings such as lead paint. We do not take ownership of hazardous materials and do not assume responsibility for the liability associated with the materials other
than for our actions meeting applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. 
 Roofing Systems.  We replace, repair and upgrade industrial facility roofing
systems, primarily at pulp and paper manufacturing facilities and nuclear power plant locations. 

         We provide these services throughout the U.S. with experienced craft laborers who are directed and managed by an experienced team of supervisors and project managers across our network. Our flexible staffing and equipment model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs. 
         As of December 31, 2015, our Services segment contracted for approximately 78% of the services it provides on a cost-plus basis under contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit in the form of a mark-up. It contracted for approximately 22% of the services it provides on a fixed-price basis. 
         We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts. 
         For information about the impact of business divestitures that occurred after the date of this report, see "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events." 
         For additional information about our segments, please refer to "Note 1Business and Organization" and "Note 19Segment Information" to our consolidated financial statements.

     Market Overview 
  Gas Turbine Power Generation and Cogeneration Market.    All gas turbine power plants combine a gas turbine with a generator to produce electricity. In a simple cycle gas turbine plant, the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is vented to the atmosphere through an exhaust stack. In a combined cycle plant, the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is fed into a HRSG. The HRSG captures much of the heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam, which in turn is used to power a steam turbine and generate more electricity before the exhaust is vented into the atmosphere. We manufacture products that are critical components of both simple cycle and combined cycle plants, including packaged control houses, cabinets and skids, or "balance of plant hardware," filter houses, inlet and exhaust systems, SCRs and turbine and generator components. We also engineer and manufacture specialized diverter dampers that are used in some combined cycle plants between the gas turbine and the HRSG. 
         The advantages of power generation plants utilizing gas turbine technologies versus certain other technologies include:
 

 lower construction costs; 
 shorter construction periods; 
 improved operating efficiency; 
 lower emissions (NOx, CO2 and other pollutants); 
 flexibility to expand plant capacity; 
 smaller geographical footprint; and 
 rapid start-up and shutdown time. 

         Oil and Gas Market.    The American Petroleum Institute defines the oil and gas industry as having three segments: Exploration and Production (also known as "upstream"), Transportation (also known as "midstream"), and Refining/Constituent Chemical Processing (also known as "downstream"). We design, manufacture, integrate and package free standing metal interlocking panel buildings that house control systems, switch gear and generators. Our products are deployed globally into the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas markets. We produce specialty engineered products, such as flow control and customized skids, while our focus on lean manufacturing processes also allows us to perform serial production for large projects. We also provide installation, facility upgrade, repair and maintenance services for midstream and downstream operations such as pipeline terminals, compressor or pumping stations and storage operations, refineries and petrochemical processing facilities and liquefied natural gas ("LNG") operations. 
         We believe demand for our products and services are driven by strength in the oil and gas production industry which is subject to volatility in energy prices and demand. 
         The North American oil and gas market has benefited in recent years from advanced extraction methods such as hydraulic fracturing which has led to pipeline expansions as well as the development of petrochemical facilities and gas separation and liquefaction projects. However, the price of oil began to decline in mid-2014 and dropped to a 14-year low in January 2016. The U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA") reports that U.S. crude oil production averaged an estimated 8.9 million barrels per day in 2016 and is forecasted to average 9.0 million barrels per day in 2017 and increase to 9.5 million barrels per day in 2018. The EIA also reports that total U.S. natural gas consumption averaged 75.1 billion cubic feet per day in 2016 and forecasts consumption of 74.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2017 and 76.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2018. 
 15

    Industrial Services Industry and Market.    The U.S. industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity and eliminate operational redundancies. 
         We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future: 
 

 Aging Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance.  According to
the EIA, more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large scale power generation facilities being
constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites provide opportunities for companies providing
these services. The low price of natural gas is driving demand for new and replacement generation capacity toward combined cycle gas powered plants. With the low price of natural gas, it is more
economical to run the plants more often, driving the demand for conversions of these plants to combined cycle technology. Further, approximately 90 nuclear reactors that have been in operation in the
U.S. for more than 30 years require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a
rigorous program of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the "NRC") oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement
and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required by the NRC to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance
during every refueling outage. Initially, commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. were licensed to operate for 40 years, reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric
utility companies for large capital investments. In 2000, the NRC issued the first license renewal for a nuclear power plant, extending its license for an additional 20 years. As of
December 31, 2016, the NRC had extended the licenses of approximately 85 reactors. In all, about 90 reactors are expected to operate for 60 years, with owners undertaking an increase in
modification, maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade these facilities. Decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors also provides future opportunities for growth. 
 International Growth.  Our Mechanical Solutions businesses have seen demand
from the Middle East, Mexico, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Large units (sometimes referred to as jumbo units) represent approximately two-thirds of the new capacity demand. Small units have also
been in demand with portable power needs and remote/island power needs. The overall number of projects in the Middle East is continuing to rise, including plant upgrades and conversion from simple
cycle to combined cycle technology. Among the factors driving this increase in gas turbines is operational flexibility, short construction time and combined-cycle gas turbine technology, developed by
the major OEMs, that exceeds 60% efficiency. 
 North America Infrastructure Growth.  A major factor in this expansion is
the widespread development of shale gas. New production and transmission and distribution infrastructure has been developed to increase production, and reduce transportation bottlenecks, bringing more
gas to key markets. Shale gas value is transitioning from upstream to downstream users, including petrochemical facilities and power generation assets. 
 New Nuclear Reactor Construction.  As of December 31, 2015, there
were five new nuclear reactors at three U.S. sites in various stages of construction and commissioning. Our Services segment was involved in each of these projects at varying levels. We have had a
significant role in the recent completion of Watts Bar Unit 2 and we have several contracts currently at Vogtle 

 16

   

Units
3 and 4 and one at VC Summer. We are one of the few contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance-1 ("NQA-1") Program, which
is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors. 


         In addition, we are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in U.S. nuclear power plants under rules issued by the NRC. Under these rules, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. On the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full-scope EPC firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms and relevant engineering firms. 
  Industrial Gas and Natural Gas Markets.    Industrial gases are used in a variety of end-markets. The global industrial gas market is projected to grow, driven by emerging markets and energy demand. In addition, natural gas demand is expected to grow, particularly from feedstock chemical manufacturers, liquefied natural gas processors and other companies in the refining and industrial gas industries that use natural gas as a feedstock. Subsequent to the date of this report, we sold our Hetsco business. Following that sale, we no longer engage in these activities. See "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events." 
         Standby and Distributed Power Generation.    Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Energy demand response and transmission and distribution infrastructure limits are driving investment into this space, along with developing industries with high power demand and sensitivity to power supply instability. Example industries include datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads. Datacenters represent a large and growing market for the Koontz-Wagner brand. The category previously consisted of small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operation. The category is moving toward larger (greater than 1,000 Kilowatts ("KW")) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets. Building our share in this market also allows Koontz-Wagner to extend our offerings into adjacent markets through the relationships we have with engine OEMs. 
   Business Strategy 
         We plan to continue leveraging our brands (Braden, Koontz-Wagner and Williams). As part of our annual strategic planning process, each of our businesses develops growth, productivity improvement and cost reduction initiatives. Each unit has specific initiatives with associated targets for revenue and cash flow. 
         We pursue revenue and margin enhancement opportunities, including streamlining and consolidating operations, utilizing state of the art estimating and engineering technologies, deploying rigorous project management techniques, initiating various process improvement projects and employing experienced industry-recognized sales professionals. 
         We are also focused on increasing our margins through the application of lean manufacturing processes and continuous improvement in our operations. We are committed to delivering quality products and services on time for our customers. In addition to pursuing better execution on the shop floor and at our project sites, we have streamlined our selling and administrative functions to better serve our customers. We have implemented a lean manufacturing processes structure to be closer to our customers and adjust faster to changing market conditions. 
 17

           We continue to add employees to expand our range of expertise and depth of knowledge. Our objective is to foster a workplace that will attract top people in our industry and challenge them with meaningful projects, reward them for their performance and advance their careers. 
   Customers, Marketing and Seasonality 
  Mechanical Solutions.    Our Mechanical Solutions segment customers are turbine and reciprocating engine OEMs, Owner/Operators, electric utilities and EPC firms. The end users of most of our products sold to OEMs and EPC firms are owners and operators of power plants. We market our products and services globally through a sales network consisting of employees and independent representatives in various geographic areas, including the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Our Mechanical Solutions segment is not materially impacted by seasonality and is more impacted by the cyclicality of, and fluctuations in, the U.S. and international economies that we serve. 
  Electrical Solutions.    Our Electrical Solutions segment customers are turbine and reciprocating engine OEMs, switchgear and drive OEMs, backup and distributed power providers, Owner/Operators (including oil and gas midstream and downstream), electric utilities and EPC firms. The end users of most of our products sold to OEMs and EPC firms are owners and operators of power plants, process plants, refineries, pipelines, data centers and other industrial and commercial facilities such as wastewater treatment plants and hospitals. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on OEMs and EPC firms engaged by end users of our products, including the developers and operators of power plants, industrial and commercial facilities and data centers. Our Electrical Solutions segment is not materially impacted by seasonality and is more impacted by the cyclicality of, and fluctuations in, the U.S. and international economies that we serve. 
         Services.    Our Services segment customers include major private and government-owned utilities throughout the U.S., as well as leaders in the U.S. paper and industrial sectors. We market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on-site operations personnel. We use our safety and service track record with long-term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement the existing contracts with small-to-medium sized capital projects. Our sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within the targeted industries and customers throughout the U.S. Our Services segment is materially impacted by seasonality, resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year. Generally, the second and fourth quarters are the peak periods for our Services segment, as those are periods of low electricity demand during which our customers schedule planned outages. 
         We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of those customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. For a listing of our major customers, see "Note 17Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk" to our consolidated financial statements. 
   Engineering, Design and Maintenance Capabilities 
  Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions.    We provide original design, retrofit and upgrade engineering, installation, technical services and after-sales maintenance and repair of our products. Our products are custom-designed and engineered to meet the specifications of our customers, including local, state, federal and international code requirements and certifications. Our engineers and designers use engineering and drafting programs such as AutoCAD®, Inventor® 3D modeling software, Solidworks® and other analytics applications. 
         Services.    Through our NQA-1 Program and other programs, we provide training, certifications and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our Services employees. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to work anywhere in a U.S. nuclear facility and have been one of the leading 
 18

   providers of coatings at U.S. nuclear facilities for almost 40 years. In addition, we are one of a few contractors with the qualified and audited NQA-1 Program that is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors. For over 13 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide. 
   Materials and Suppliers 
         The majority of materials we purchase are for our Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments. The principal materials for our products are carbon steel plate, sheet steel, stainless steel products and other structural shapes, wire, cable and insulation. We obtain these materials from a number of U.S. and international suppliers. The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain the materials we require from more than one supplier. 
 Competition 
  Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions.    We compete with a number of domestic and international companies. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources. Other competitors are small, typically privately held companies that are often less sensitive to project risk and onerous contract terms. The competitive landscape is defined not only by the specific product offering, but also geographic delivery footprint, total delivery cycle time (from order to title transfer), reputation, build quality, ability to design products to meet each customer's unique specifications (including design elements and manufacturing methods impacting the total cost of ownership, designed ease of site installation and landed equipment footprint), and total project price. A project's competiveness can be influenced by any one or a number of these conditions. 
  Services.    Our competitors vary depending on plant geography and scope of services to be rendered. Several national vendors, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These include, among others, Day & Zimmerman and Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Additionally, smaller vendors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We believe that the key competitive factors in the services we offer are reputation, safety, price, service, quality, breadth of service capabilities and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel. We believe our project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers' sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers' service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, the barriers to entry include requirement of NRC qualifications and safety standards.

   Employees 
         As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,449 full- and part-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor in our Services segment). Of those, 172 were employed at our facility in Mexico under a collective bargaining agreement, which is amended annually and expires April 21, 2017. Although we will continue to maintain an office in Mexico to support Braden's outsourcing activities and sales in Mexico, we ceased manufacturing operations at our Mexico facility in the fourth quarter of 2016. At 
 19

   our Koontz-Wagner business, there are 54 employees who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The number of employees in our Services segment fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees for our Services segment are contracted through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2015, there were 1,389 craft labor employees for our Services segment, of which 1,106 were under collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory. We are not aware of any circumstances that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of our facilities. Subsequent to the date of this report, we sold certain of our businesses and ceased operations at certain facilities, which resulted in a decrease in the number of our employees. For additional information, see "Explanatory NoteSubsequent Events." 
   Insurance 
         We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and self-insured retentions. 
         Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third-party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers or provide letters of credit in lieu of bonds to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on some projects. 
         We maintain performance and payment bonding lines in order to support our business and, as of December 31, 2015, a revolving credit facility ("Revolving Credit Facility") that provided letters of credit. We require certain of our Mechanical Solutions segment subcontractors to indemnify us and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors' work. We require the subcontractors that we use for our Services segment to indemnify us and our customers, and we also require them to name the Williams business or other subsidiaries as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors' work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors' work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We use a variety of trademarks, proprietary technologies and other intellectual property in the ordinary course of business in our segments. We rely upon our pending and issued patents, registered and unregistered trademark rights, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, subcontractors, customers and others, and on various other security measures to protect our intellectual property. Several patents relating to exhaust systems will expire in 2017, a patent relating to a filter element clip will expire in 2027, a patent for an acoustic module enclosure door will expire in 2032 and a patent for an exhaust plenum for gas turbines will expire in 2033. We have patent applications pending for other products. We do not believe that any single patent or proprietary technology is material to our business, and we do not believe that our competitive position would be materially affected by competitors also using similar technologies and systems. 
 Compliance with Government Regulations 
         We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory, export and product safety laws applicable in the countries in which we operate. We also 
 20

   purchase materials and equipment from third-parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. 
 

 Environmental.  We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws
and regulations in the U.S. and in international jurisdictions where we do business. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of
hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or
hazardous materials. 
 Health and Safety Regulations.  We are subject to the requirements of the
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state and international laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction
services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs in order to protect employees from workplace
hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety
regulations. 
 NRC.  Owners of nuclear power plants are licensed to build, operate and
maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. Our nuclear
services business must demonstrate to its customers that we will comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and
conduct. 
 Other Regulatory Matters.  To the extent we export technical services, data
and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports. These include, but are not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. 
 Department of the Treasury.  A failure to comply with these laws and
regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. 

         While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory, export and product safety laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.
