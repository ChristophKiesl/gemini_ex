ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our Company
We own, operate and franchise two restaurant brands, Pollo Tropical® and Taco Cabana®, which have over 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history and loyal customer bases. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature fire-grilled and crispy citrus marinated chicken and other freshly prepared menu items, while our Taco Cabana restaurants specialize in Mexican-inspired food with most items made fresh. We believe that both brands offer distinct and unique flavors with broad appeal at a compelling value, which differentiates them in the competitive fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments. Nearly all of our restaurants offer the convenience of drive-thru windows.
For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, average annual sales per restaurant was approximately $2.2 million for our Pollo Tropical restaurants and approximately $1.6 million for our Taco Cabana restaurants. As of January 3, 2021, we owned and operated 138 Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and 143 Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas for a total of 281 restaurants. We franchise our Pollo Tropical restaurants primarily in international markets, and as of January 3, 2021, had 23 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants outside the United States. In addition, as of January 3, 2021, we had five domestic non-traditional Pollo Tropical licensed locations on college campuses and one location in a hospital in Florida. As of January 3, 2021, we had six Taco Cabana franchised restaurants in New Mexico. For the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, we generated consolidated revenues of $554.8 million, and comparable restaurant sales decreased 14.7% and 14.4% for Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, exclude the 53rd week and are reported on a 52-week basis.
COVID-19
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected and is continuing to affect the restaurant industry and the economy. In response to COVID-19 and in compliance with governmental restrictions, we closed the dining room seating areas in all Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, limiting service to take-out, drive-thru, and delivery operations beginning in mid-March 2020. We also temporarily closed three Pollo Tropical locations due to the impact of the restrictions on sales, one of which was reopened during the second quarter of 2020 and two of which were subsequently permanently closed in August 2020. We began opening certain dining rooms at 50% capacity with the easing of municipality restrictions during the second quarter of 2020; however, we temporarily closed all dining rooms on July 12, 2020, in response to increased COVID-19 infection rates in both Texas and Florida. We began re-opening certain dining rooms and patios with limited capacity and hours at both brands and the state of Florida removed restaurant capacity restrictions at the end of September 2020. We opened approximately 25 dining rooms with limited hours and capacity at both brands and opened approximately 75 patios at Taco Cabana in the fourth quarter of 2020. We are evaluating opening additional dining rooms with limited hours at Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana. 
Comparable restaurant sales at both Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants declined in 2020 compared to the prior year as a result of the pandemic. However, both brands experienced sequential comparable restaurant sales improvement in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to comparable restaurant sales in the second quarter of 2020. We believe our significant mix of dine-in sales prior to the pandemic had a negative impact on comparable restaurant sales. Our dine-in and take-out sales from orders placed at the counter as a percentage of total sales for Pollo Tropical decreased to 28.0% of total sales in 2020 compared to 49.0% of total sales in 2019 and for Taco Cabana decreased to 17.0% of total sales in 2020 compared to 41.4% of total sales in 2019. Our sales shifted to a higher percentage of drive-thru and delivery sales in 2020. Our drive-thru and delivery sales as a percentage of total sales for Pollo Tropical increased to 61.1% and 7.3% of total sales, respectively, in 2020 compared to 46.8% and 1.8% of total sales, respectively, in 2019 and for Taco Cabana increased to 75.2% and 4.6% of total sales, respectively, in 2020 compared to 55.1% and 1.2% of total sales, respectively, in 2019. Through our investments in online and mobile ordering, and partnerships with multiple delivery service providers, we were well positioned for the shift in sales channels. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant negative disruptive impact on our supply chain or access to labor, although there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We continue to actively monitor our food suppliers to determine how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we have built additional inventory backstock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to proteins and sanitation and safety supplies.
We incurred additional costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic totaling an estimated $4.3 million during the year ended January 3, 2021 including additional labor costs such as COVID-19 special incentive pay, quarantine pay and overtime to cover 
for employees in quarantine, as well as COVID-19 testing costs and additional operating expenses for safety related supplies including masks, cleaning supplies and sanitizer. Although we discontinued COVID-19 special incentive pay after the second quarter of 2020, we expect many of the other COVID-19 related costs to continue during the pandemic.
Our Brands
Our restaurants operate in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and feature fresh-made cooking, drive-thru service and catering.
Pollo Tropical. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants feature fresh chicken marinated in a proprietary blend of tropical fruit juices and spices, crispy or fire-grilled, boneless and bone-in. Other favorite menu items include Mojo Roast Pork and TropiChops® (a create your own bowl of fire-grilled or crispy chicken breast, roast pork or grilled vegetables served over white, brown or yellow rice, red or black beans, or mac and cheese, and topped with vegetables including tomatoes, kernel corn, peppers and sautéed onions), sandwiches, wraps and salads. Side dishes include rice, beans, french fries, and balsamic tomatoes. The menu's emphasis is on freshness and quality. We also offer a wide selection of sauces, cilantro, onions and other items which allow our guests to further customize their orders. Dessert offerings include key lime pie, cuatro leches cake, flan, cheesecake, as well as limited-time seasonal items, and beverages include fountain soft drinks, flavored brewed teas, and other bottled drinks. Most menu items are prepared daily in each of our restaurants, which feature open display cooking on large, open-flame grills. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests and catering for parties and corporate events. We began selling alcoholic beverages including wine and beer at most Pollo Tropical locations in 2020 to increase off-premise sales. 
Our Pollo Tropical restaurant dining areas are designed to create an inviting, festive and tropical atmosphere. We also provide our guests the option of take-out, including the ability to order online in advance, and nearly all of our restaurants provide the convenience of drive-thru windows. Delivery is available through third-party partnerships at all Pollo Tropical locations. Our Pollo Tropical restaurants are generally open for lunch, dinner, and late night seven days a week. As of January 3, 2021, substantially all of our Pollo Tropical restaurants were freestanding buildings. Our typical freestanding Pollo Tropical restaurant ranges from 2,800 to 3,700 square feet and provides interior seating for approximately 70 to 90 guests. During the year ended January 3, 2021, the majority of our sales were through drive-thru windows, take-out, or delivery. For the year ended January 3, 2021, the average sales transaction at our Pollo Tropical restaurants was $12.83, with sales at dinner and lunch representing 50.3% and 49.7%, respectively. For the year ended January 3, 2021, our Pollo Tropical brand generated total revenues of $315.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $36.5 million.
Pollo Tropical opened its first restaurant in 1988 in Miami, Florida. As of January 3, 2021, we owned and operated a total of 138 Pollo Tropical restaurants, all located in Florida.
We are franchising and licensing our Pollo Tropical restaurants internationally and in non-traditional domestic locations. As of January 3, 2021, we had 23 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants located in Puerto Rico, Panama, Guyana, Ecuador, and the Bahamas, and five non-traditional licensed locations on college campuses and one located in a hospital in Florida. We have agreements for the continued development of franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in certain of our existing franchised markets.
Taco Cabana. Our Taco Cabana restaurants serve fresh, Mexican-inspired food that feature loaded tacos, steak and chicken fajitas, quesadillas, flautas, enchiladas, burritos, and customizable Cabana Bowls®. We also offer freshly made flour tortillas, shareable appetizers and our popular breakfast tacos and dozen taco boxes. Our self-service salsa bar includes a wide selection of freshly made salsas, sauces, sliced jalapeños, chopped cilantro, chopped onions and other items which allow our guests to further customize their orders. We temporarily closed our salsa bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also offer desserts such as sopapillas and New Churros, as well as beverages including fountain soft drinks, our signature frozen margaritas, and bottled beer—all available to-go as well. Most menu items are freshly-prepared at each restaurant daily. 
Taco Cabana restaurants feature open display cooking that enables guests to observe fajitas cooking on an open grill, a tortilla machine pressing and grilling fresh flour tortillas and the fresh preparation of other menu items. Our Taco Cabana restaurants feature interior dining areas as well as semi-enclosed and outdoor patio areas, which provide a vibrant decor and relaxing atmosphere. Many locations also had live entertainment at select times prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer both individual and family meal-sized portions, which enable us to provide a home meal replacement for our guests and catering for parties and corporate events. Additionally, we provide our guests the option to order online in advance, as well as the convenience of drive-thru windows. Delivery is available through third-party partnerships at all locations. Our typical freestanding Taco Cabana restaurants average approximately 3,500 square feet (exclusive of the exterior dining area) and provide seating for approximately 80 guests, with additional outside patio seating for approximately 50 guests. 
As of January 3, 2021, substantially all of our Taco Cabana restaurants were freestanding buildings. During the year ended January 3, 2021, the majority of our sales were through drive-thru windows, take-out, or delivery.
Taco Cabana pioneered the Mexican patio cafe concept with its first restaurant in San Antonio, Texas, in 1978. As of January 3, 2021, we owned and operated 143 Taco Cabana restaurants, all located in Texas. As of January 3, 2021, we also had six Taco Cabana franchised restaurants located in New Mexico. Hours of operation vary by location, and some restaurants operated 24 hours a day prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended January 3, 2021, sales at dinner, lunch and breakfast represented 28.7%, 23.2% and 23.3%, respectively, and the average sales transaction at our Taco Cabana restaurants was $11.74. For the year ended January 3, 2021, our Taco Cabana brand generated total revenues of $239.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 million. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe our competitive strengths include the following key attributes: 
Well Positioned and Differentiated in the Fast-Casual and Quick-Service Segments. As of January 3, 2021, we owned, operated and franchised 316 fast-casual restaurants under our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands which have over 30 and 40 years, respectively, of operating history. Although the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on our average unit sales per restaurant, at $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for 2020, we believe Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana have compelling average annual sales per restaurant within the fast-casual and quick-service segments, and we experienced sequential improvement in average unit sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020. We believe our brands are well positioned in the industry due to our high quality, freshly-prepared food, value and differentiation of flavor profiles. 
Two Leading, Differentiated Brands Serving Freshly Prepared, High Quality Foods with Broad Appeal and a Compelling Value Proposition. Our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands are differentiated from other dining options and offer distinct flavor profiles and healthy menu choices at affordable prices that we believe have broad consumer appeal, provide guests with a compelling value proposition, attract a diverse customer base and drive guest frequency and loyalty. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to serving freshly-prepared food using quality ingredients that are made-to-order and customized for each guest. Both of our brands offer a wide range of menu offerings and home meal replacement options in generous portion sizes and at affordable price points which appeal to a broad customer base. Our open display kitchen format allows guests to view and experience our food being freshly-prepared and cooked to order. We continue to refine our menus, including some seasonal offerings at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, in order to provide variety to our guests, address changes in consumer preferences, and maintain a speed of service that appeals to our customers. We also selectively use promotions and limited time offers which are intended to reinforce our value proposition and to introduce new products. Additionally, we offer our guests the convenience of drive-thru service, online ordering, curbside pickup, and delivery through third-party delivery services in order to provide a viable option for home meal replacement and family meals. In 2020, Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical began selling alcohol through the drive-thru and to-go.
Compelling Business Model. We enjoy significant brand recognition due to high market penetration of our restaurants in our core markets which provides operating, marketing and distribution efficiencies and convenience for our guests. Both of our brands have strong brand affinity in our core markets as evidenced by fast-casual and quick-service segment-leading average annual sales volumes, as noted above. Pollo Tropical produces above average restaurant-level operating margins. Taco Cabana restaurant-level operating margins improved in 2020 and, with sales stabilization and growth and effective cost management, we anticipate Taco Cabana will produce higher restaurant-level operating margins in the future.
Growth Strategies 
Our long-term strategy is focused on profitably building our base business, growing new distribution channels, including catering, delivery, licensed and franchised locations, and development of new restaurants. 
Our strategies for growth primarily include: 
Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales. We experienced a decrease in comparable restaurant sales in 2020, which we believe was attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our significant mix of dine-in sales prior to the pandemic had a negative impact on comparable restaurant sales. We also experienced a decrease in comparable restaurant sales in 2019 which we believe was attributable to a decline in comparable restaurant transactions due in part to challenging market and industry conditions, discounted pricing and, for Pollo Tropical, the negative impact of Hurricane Dorian, partially offset by menu price increases and the introduction of higher priced shareables in 2019. We simplified the Taco Cabana menu in the fourth quarter of 2019 to improve execution. The menu simplification efforts included removal of certain menu items and limited other items to certain dayparts. While the menu simplification improved guest satisfaction and reduced order cycle 
times, the reduced menu resulted in a greater than anticipated transaction decline. We selectively re-introduced select items to the menu in 2020 to increase sales while maintaining the operational improvements provided by the menu simplification. We are focused on increasing comparable restaurant sales in the future by attracting new customers and increasing guest frequency through the following strategies:
•Focus on consistency of operations and food quality: We believe high quality food and hospitality, a comfortable ambience, and reasonable prices result in an enjoyable guest experience, which drives loyalty and guest frequency. We have improved systems, processes and equipment, implemented tighter management spans of control and enhanced our field leadership teams, and we continue to focus on improving systems and processes to ensure consistency of operations at both brands. In addition, supply chain and food preparation processes have been implemented at both brands to ensure high quality, freshness and consistency of our food, which we believe are critical components to the continued success of our brands.
•New product innovation: Across both brands, our menus are centered on freshly prepared, quality food offerings that we believe have both broad appeal and provide everyday value. Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana each have separate teams of product research and development professionals that enables us to continually refine our menu offerings and develop new products, several of which are validated by consumer research. Maintaining a strong product pipeline is critical to keeping our offerings compelling, and we intend to introduce innovative new menu items and enhancements to existing menu favorites throughout the year to drive further guest traffic, maximize guest frequency, and increase average check. 
•Focus on effective advertising to highlight our everyday value proposition: Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana utilize an integrated, multi-level marketing approach that includes periodic system-wide promotions, outdoor marketing including billboards, in-restaurant promotions, local trade area marketing, social media, digital and web-based marketing and other strategies, including the use of radio and television advertising and limited-time offer menu item and value promotions. In addition, we introduced new email and app-based loyalty programs at Pollo Tropical (My Pollo™) and Taco Cabana (My TC™) in 2018 to further connect with our guests to build affinity and frequency. In 2020, we introduced new state-of-the-art mobile apps for both Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana. As a percentage of Pollo Tropical restaurant sales, Pollo Tropical's advertising expenditures were 2.7% in 2020, 3.4% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2018. As a percentage of Taco Cabana restaurant sales, Taco Cabana's advertising expenditures were 2.7% in 2020, 3.6% in 2019 and 3.4% in 2018.
•Grow our off-premise sales with focus on digital platform: The inclusion of portable menu items, such as wraps, sandwiches, bowls and salads, as well as family meals, and an increased focus on catering and delivery will continue to be a key focus for both brands as we look to capture more off-premise meal occasions which we believe may be significant. Off-premise meal consumption increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic and we believe that off-premise sales may continue to be significant following the pandemic. In 2018, we invested in catering resources utilizing dedicated leadership and enhanced digital capabilities, enhanced online ordering, and smart phone apps. In late 2018, we began deploying our portable point-of-sale tablets which accept payment to improve speed of service and throughput in our drive-thru lanes. In 2019, we invested in our catering business by adding dedicated catering sales managers and catering online ordering capabilities, we partnered with a third-party delivery partner to provide delivery services, and we created Rapid Pickup for online orders at Pollo Tropical. In 2020, we created Rapid Pickup for online orders at Taco Cabana and expanded our third-party delivery partnerships to include delivery through multiple delivery service providers for both brands. We engaged a third party to improve our mobile apps and enhance our digital connections and interactions to grow our digital business and create experiences that minimize friction within our digital platforms including creating state-of-the-art mobile apps. We also implemented curbside pickup functionality as an option with online ordering and began improving connectivity at our restaurants, upgrading portable tablets and enabling touchless payments. We plan to continue to invest to improve our digital platform and to improve the speed and ease of use for off-premise sales channels including an enhanced drive-thru experience, geofencing technology for curbside orders and infrastructure changes to improve the speed of order cycle time for drive-thru and delivery orders.
•Continue our reimage program: We believe ensuring a high-quality restaurant environment that complements our quality focus on food and hospitality will further drive incremental sales and profitability. We continue to implement restaurant enhancement initiatives to ensure safe, consistent and appealing experiences at our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants. We are continuing the process of redefining the Pollo Topical brand essence. We have completed the qualitative research and are in the process of completing the quantitative phase of our research. The results of this research will allow us to develop a brand positioning and will provide a clear brand strategy for both existing and new markets. 
Non-Traditional License and International Franchise Development. We are updating our Pollo Tropical franchise disclosure documents each year to support potential franchise growth in the future. We are currently primarily focused on growing non-traditional domestic licensed locations on university campuses and non-traditional licensed locations in airports and highway rest stops, while modestly growing international locations with quality operators.
Improve Profitability and Optimize Our Infrastructure. We believe that our large restaurant base, skilled management team, operating systems, technology initiatives and training and development programs support our strategy of enhancing operating efficiencies while prudently growing our restaurant base. We continue to focus on maximizing cost efficiencies, including, among other things, implementing profit enhancement initiatives focused on food and labor costs, leveraging our purchasing power and enhancing our supply chain to optimize costs while delivering a high-quality guest experience with consistency. Our restaurant-level profitability at Pollo Tropical is very competitive within the restaurant industry segments in which we compete. Taco Cabana's restaurant-level margins improved in 2020. We believe Taco Cabana will become more competitive within the restaurant industry segments in which we compete over time through growing comparable restaurant sales and traffic, other margin improvement initiatives, simplifying our operating platform and improved execution.
Develop New Restaurants. We believe that we have opportunities to develop additional Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in Florida and Texas, respectively, as well as potential future expansion opportunities in other regions of the United States that match our site selection criteria. We paused our new restaurant development plans in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we intend to resume new restaurant development in the future. The development of new restaurants will incorporate what we have learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and our reimaging market research, both qualitative and quantitative. During 2021, we plan to continue the process of brand positioning and operating model refinements for Pollo Tropical that we believe will enable future geographic expansion through both company-owned and franchised locations. Our primary focus for Taco Cabana in 2021 will be on improving existing unit average unit sales and continuing to improve margins. 
We target opening freestanding restaurants in order to provide drive-thru service which is an important convenience and sales component for our brands. The location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management team determines the acceptability of all new sites based upon site visits, analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals, and third-party proprietary location research and analysis. Historically, this process has typically resulted in entering into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building or the conversion of an existing building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility.
The following table includes the historical initial interior cost (including equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs) of a typical new or converted freestanding restaurant, as well as the historical exterior cost (including building and site improvements).

 | Pollo Tropical | Taco Cabana 
Interior costs and signage | $0.6 million to $0.9 million | $0.4 million to $0.6 million
Exterior costs | $1.2 million to $1.6 million | $0.5 million to $1.4 million

The cost of building and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions, geographic considerations, the size of the restaurant, the characteristics of a particular site, and whether we are constructing a new building or converting an existing building. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened. 
Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with many national and regional quick service, fast casual, and in some cases casual dining restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants. We also compete with delivered meal solutions, convenience stores, grocery stores and other restaurant retailers.
We believe that:
•product quality and taste; 
•brand differentiation and recognition; 
•convenience of location; 
•speed of service; 
•menu variety; 
•value perception; 
•ambience; 
•cleanliness; and
•hospitality
are among the important competitive factors in the fast-casual and quick-service restaurant segments and that our two concepts effectively compete against those categories. Pollo Tropical's competitors include national and regional chicken-based concepts, as well as other concepts. Taco Cabana's competitors include other Mexican-inspired concepts as well as other concepts.

(1)    Average annual sales for company-owned restaurants are derived by dividing restaurant sales for such year for the applicable segment by the average number of company-owned restaurants for the applicable segment for such year. For comparative purposes, the calculation of average annual sales per company-owned restaurant is based on a 52-week fiscal year. Restaurant sales data for the extra week in the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 have been excluded for purposes of calculating average annual sales per company-owned restaurant.
Seasonality 
Our business is marginally seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Sales from our restaurants located in South Florida are generally higher during the winter months than during the summer months, while sales from our restaurants located in Texas, Central Florida, and North Florida are generally higher during the summer months than the winter months. In addition, we have outdoor seating at many of our restaurants and the effects of adverse weather may impact the use of these areas and may negatively impact our restaurant sales.
Operations
Management Information Systems 
Our management information systems provide us the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. 
In all corporate-owned restaurants, we use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support potential future growth plans. We use touch-screen point-of-sale (POS) systems, both fixed and mobile, designed specifically for the restaurant industry that facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking, are user-friendly, require limited cashier training, improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques, and provide appropriate audit trails. We use credit card processing devices which utilize industry-leading Point to Point Encryption that protect our customer's credit card data. The POS systems are integrated with above-store enterprise applications that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. All products sold and related prices at our restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office.
We provide in-store access to enterprise systems that assist in labor scheduling and food cost management, allow online ordering from distributors, and reduce managers' administrative time. Critical information from such systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information from all restaurants under their control and have access to key operating data on a remote basis. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize key restaurant performance indicators to manage our business.
These enterprise systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs, and other key operating information for each restaurant. These systems also provide the ability to monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant and provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data.
We use an integrated digital ordering system that is integrated with our POS system at each restaurant. Individual, group or catering orders placed on our website or that of our third-party delivery partners, mobile app or through our call center are transmitted electronically to the restaurants to provide a seamless ordering, payment and pickup or delivery experience for our guests.
In 2020, we moved from legacy white-label smartphone apps for each brand to customized, proprietary apps developed in partnership with a leading third-party app developer. We also developed and deployed a curbside delivery program in order to help alleviate congestion at the drive-thru with dining rooms largely closed. In order to maintain security, compliance, and maximum performance, we rolled out new Point of Sale servers and introduced a Chromebook for managers to perform office productivity functions. We enhanced our Business Intelligence platform to create significantly more sophisticated market basket affinity analysis.
We expect to continue making substantial investments in technology that we believe will drive sales and traffic, as well as improve margins. In 2021, we intend to focus technology investments on consumer digital interactions and loyalty, best-in-class mobile POS and digital menu boards in the drive-thru channel, and maximizing performance and range of our in-store technologies dedicated to off-premise sales. 
Community Social Impact 
We are committed to being a deeply responsible company in the communities where we do business. Our focus is on serving high quality food to our guests and contributing positively to the communities where our restaurants are located. This is integral to our business strategy. Our initiatives include:
•Our chicken is free of hormones and trans-fats and our shrimp is Best Aquaculture certified;
•Our chicken is sourced from suppliers dedicated to uphold responsible animal welfare practices;
•We continue to pursue finding more earth-friendly serving and packaging materials for our products including bags that are made from recycled material, are 100% recyclable and reusable and are Rainforest Alliance certified, paper drink cups that are Sustainable Forest Initiative certified and aluminum that contains postindustrial re-processed and post-consumer material;
•Military veterans are actively recruited to work at our restaurants;
•We have military appreciation days and we provide discounts to military and first responders;
•We assist, through our non-profit Fiesta Family Foundation, many of our employees who have personally suffered losses or other hardships; and
•During the COVID pandemic in 2020, Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana provided approximately 113,000 and 58,000 free meals to school-aged children, respectively, and approximately 22,000 and 13,000 free meals to first responders and healthcare professionals, respectively. Pollo Tropical also donated approximately $60 thousand in food donations to Miami Rescue Mission. Additionally, Taco Cabana provided approximately 6,000 meals to hospitals, non-profit organizations and homeless shelters and provided a $6 thousand turkey donation to the San Antonio Food Bank.
•In 2020, we provided monetary and food donations or volunteered to the following organizations: Fire and Police departments, hospitals and COVID testing and vaccination sites throughout Florida and Texas, Big Brother Helping Hand, Boys and Girls Clubs of Austin and San Antonio, Boysville, Child Crisis Center of El Paso, Children's Shelter of San Antonio, Farm Workers Association, Kidz Nation, La Posada Shelter, Love our Youth Orlando, Miami Rescue Mission, Our Calling, Ronald McDonald House, Salvation Army, SOS Kids - Coconut Creek, St. Jude's Shelter, Star of Hope, United Way, YMCA, and Zebra Coalition.

As a result of these initiatives, we believe we deliver benefits to our stakeholders, including employees, business partners, customers, suppliers, stockholders, community members, and others. 
Suppliers and Distributors 
For our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have negotiated directly with local and national suppliers for the purchase of food and beverage products and supplies to ensure consistent quality and freshness and to obtain competitive prices. Supply contracts are negotiated on an annual basis in some cases to obtain favorable pricing and ensure consistent supply flow. Food and supplies for both brands are ordered from approved suppliers and are shipped to the restaurants via distributors. Both brands are responsible for monitoring quality control, for the supervision of these suppliers and for conducting inspections to observe preparations and ensure the quality of products purchased.
For both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have service agreements with our primary distributors of food and paper products. Performance Food Group, Inc., is our primary distributor of food and beverage products and supplies for both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under a distribution services agreement that expires on July 27, 2024. We 
also currently rely on five suppliers for chicken for our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under agreements that expire on December 31, 2021.
Quality Assurance 
Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana are committed to obtaining quality ingredients and creating freshly-prepared food in a safe manner. In addition to operating in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations regarding minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness, among other things, we have also developed our own internal quality control standards. We require our suppliers to adhere to our high quality control standards, and we regularly inspect their products and production and distribution facilities to ensure that they conform to those standards. In addition, we have implemented certain procedures to ensure that we serve safe, quality meals to our guests. As an example, we utilize the nationally-recognized ServSafe program to train our kitchen staff and managers on proper food handling and preparation techniques. In addition, we have hired a third party that conducts unscheduled food safety inspections of our restaurants, and restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. These third-party inspections are one of the metrics used in our restaurant-level incentive bonus programs.
In addition to food safety, our operational focus at each of our two concepts is closely monitored to achieve a high level of guest satisfaction via speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with our operating policies. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the restaurants and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute to our restaurant operations management team detailed reports measuring compliance with various guest service standards and objectives, including feedback obtained directly from our guests. The guest feedback is monitored by an independent agency and by us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have in-house guest service representatives that manage guest feedback and inquiries.
Trademarks 
We believe that our trademarks, service marks, trade dress, logos and other proprietary intellectual property are important to our success. We have registered the principal Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana logos and designs with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register as a service mark for our restaurant services. We also have secured or have applied for state and federal registrations for several other advertising or promotional marks, including variations of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks as well as those related to our core menu offerings. In connection with our current and potential international franchising activities, we have applied for or been granted registrations in foreign countries of the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana principal marks and several other marks. 
Other than the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana trademarks and the logo and trademark of Fiesta Restaurant Group (including Internet domain names and addresses) and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings, we have no proprietary intellectual property. 
Continued Commitment to Strong Governance
We declassified our board of directors so that beginning at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our entire board of directors stands for re-election for a one-year term. Additionally, in 2018, our board of directors adopted a mandatory maximum age of 75 for any director nominee. 
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or reimaged are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and reimaging of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing employment matters. While we pay, on average, rates that are above the federal minimum wage, and where applicable, state minimum wage, increases in those minimum wages have in the past increased wage rates at our restaurants and in the future will affect our labor costs. We are also subject to provisions of the comprehensive federal health care reform law. We anticipate that a combination of labor management, cost reduction initiatives, technology and menu price increases can materially offset the potential increased costs associated with future regulations.
Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical are subject to alcoholic beverage control regulations that require state, county or municipal licenses or permits to sell alcoholic beverages at each restaurant location that sells alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed every one to two years and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Licensing entities, authorized with law enforcement authority, may issue violations and conduct audits and investigations of the restaurant's records and procedures. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants including minimum age for consumption, certification requirements for employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. These regulations also prescribe certain required banking and accounting practices related to alcohol sales and purchasing. Our restaurants are subject to state "dram-shop" laws. Dram-shop laws provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated or minor patron. We have specific insurance that covers claims arising under dram-shop laws. However, we cannot ensure that this insurance will be adequate to cover any claims that may be instituted against us. 
Human Capital Management
As of January 3, 2021, we employed approximately 8,020 persons, of which approximately 170 were corporate and administrative personnel and approximately 7,850 were restaurant operations and other supervisory personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider that overall relations with our employees are favorable. 
Culture, Values & Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
At Fiesta, we are in the business of inclusive hospitality. We strive to create diverse, respectful spaces where innovation can thrive, where being courageous is rewarded, and where treating each other like family is a core value. 
These qualities have supported over 30 and 40 years of successful operations for our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brands, respectively. We believe that the investments we are making in our employees, our restaurants, and our communities will contribute to our continued success in the restaurant business. 
As of January 3, 2021, approximately 63% of our U.S.-based employee population identified as female and approximately 89% of our U.S based employee population is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, approximately 29% of our executive officers are female and approximately 57% are racial and ethnic minorities. Furthermore, approximately 60% of the restaurant field management of our restaurant brands identified as female and more than approximately 81% of this group is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities.
As a truly diverse organization, we foster a culture of inclusion that helps to remove some of the barriers to workplace entry and professional development that diverse groups might face. We provide opportunities for career progression through the training and development investments we make. Many of our field managers started as hourly team members and have had the opportunity to move up and become managers and supervisors at the corporate level. We believe in developing and promoting from within and in 2020 promoted over 400 employees to management or leadership roles.
We are committed to enhancing equality in ongoing career advancement for women and minorities through targeted education and development programs. Relevant initiatives include:
•Ongoing assessment and management of our talent pipeline to support the career progression of high-potential women and minorities;
•Well defined Career Path Programs for hourly employees to advance to management;
•Cultural and Compliance training for all our employees;
•Creating a Women's Forum.
Total Rewards
We believe rewarding our employees for their hard work and commitment starts with pay. We pay, on average, rates that are above the federal minimum wage. In addition to their fixed salary, restaurant and district managers are compensated with an incentive bonus, based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision. We understand the importance of offering our employees benefits for all aspects of their lives. Through our benefits program we hope to provide our employees with the stability they need to succeed not only in their careers, but in their personal lives as well. Benefits offered to all corporate employees, who work more than 24 hours per week include paid time-off programs including holiday; personal; vacation; family leave; and volunteer time and retirement savings plan with company match. Additionally, all employees are 
eligible for assistance, through our non-profit Fiesta Family Foundation, which provides assistance to our employees who have personally suffered losses or other hardships.
Training and Development
We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all our restaurant employees and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly team members. Technology enhancements, expansion of leadership development curriculum and newly designed e-learning courses complement the recent introduction of a new Learning Management System platform to focus our team members on system-wide operating procedures by position, food preparation methods and guest service standards. 
We have developed a comprehensive management training program, complemented by active coaching and dedicated field training manager supervision for all new managers. During the new manager onboarding process, we customize an intensive, self-paced ongoing development program designed to prepare each employee for the next level of management. The onboarding period also includes robust classroom training with an emphasis on skill and competency building. 
Our Response to COVID-19
The health and well-being of our employees and guests has always been and continues to be our top priority. To ensure the health and well-being of all of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also provided the following incremental COVID-19 benefits:
•Introduced paid time off for associates required to quarantine or who faced illness due to COVID-19;
•Sponsored employer paid COVID-19 testing for employees;
•Embarked on communication plan to ensure that associates are aware of our Employee Assistance Program coverage with a focus on mental health support for employees and their families;
•Increased all hourly base wages during the second quarter of 2020 when we were most impacted by the global pandemic;
•Provided a special bonus in the second quarter of 2020 for our salaried restaurant managers;
•Provided employees with additional two hours of paid time off for each COVID-19 vaccine shot (total of 4 hours);
•Initiated a program for providing employees with the necessary tools and resources to educate themselves about the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine to enable employees to make the best decision for themselves;
•Instituted protocols on wearing masks and gloves, conducting employee screenings and temperature checks, and implementing enhanced cleaning measures;
•Implemented work from home for each of our support centers; and
•Installed tempered glass shields at the counters.
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our operations, training, marketing, real estate, facilities and culinary research and development support functions from our Pollo Tropical division headquarters in Miami, Florida, and our Taco Cabana division headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. The management structure of Pollo Tropical consists of one Senior Vice President of Operations who is supported by four Regional Directors and 17 District Managers. The management structure of Taco Cabana consists of one Senior Vice President of Operations who is supported by four Regional Directors and 17 District Managers. The Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana management structure is supported by a number of divisional and corporate executives with responsibility for operations, marketing, guest engagement, product development, purchasing, human resources, training, real estate and finance. For each of our brands, a district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately eight restaurants and a regional director is responsible for an average of approximately 35 restaurants. Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants or held an equivalent position to district manager at a competing restaurant concept. District managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision. Typically, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried restaurant or general manager and one to three salaried assistant managers and one to eight hourly shift leaders.
Our executive management functions are primarily conducted from our offices in Dallas, Texas, and Miami, Florida. Our management team is led by Richard Stockinger, who serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dirk Montgomery who serves as our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Louis DiPietro who serves as our Senior Vice President, Chief Legal and People Officer and Corporate Secretary, Hope Diaz who serves as our Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Patricia Lopez Calleja who serves as our Senior Vice President and Chief Experience Officer, Eladio 
"Willie" Romeo who serves as our Senior Vice President of Restaurant Operations for Pollo Tropical, and Ulyses Camacho who serves as our Senior Vice President of Operations for Taco Cabana.

ITEM  1A. RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as other information and data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may impair our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations and results of operations.
As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, customer traffic has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted at our restaurants and has made, and could continue to make, it more difficult to staff our restaurants and, in more severe cases, cause a temporary inability to obtain supplies, increase commodity costs or cause full and partial closures of our affected restaurants, sometimes for prolonged periods of time. We temporarily shifted to a "to-go" only operating model at many of our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants in Florida and Texas, suspending sit-down dining and serving our guests through take-out, drive-thru and delivery. We also implemented closures, modified hours or reductions in on-site staff, resulting in canceled shifts for some of our employees. COVID-19 has also adversely affected our ability to implement our growth plans, including delays in construction of new restaurants. These changes and any additional changes have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. While we have begun to open selected dining rooms where we believe it is prudent to do so, there can be no assurance that conditions will permit us to open dining rooms in all of our restaurants or that we will not be required to close our restaurants again in the future if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens. 
In addition, our operations have been, and could continue to be, disrupted by employees who are unable or unwilling to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, fear of contracting COVID-19 or caring for family members due to a COVID-19 illness. Restaurant closures, menu changes or modified hours of operation due to staffing shortages could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. To protect the health and safety of our employees and guests, we provide face coverings for all restaurant employees, provided temporary wage increases during the initial onset of the pandemic, provide paid emergency leave for COVID-related concerns, paid discretionary bonuses to restaurant managers, purchased additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials, as well as tamper evident packaging seals for all digital orders and implemented improvements to our restaurants, such as tempered glass shields at the counter. These measures have increased our operating costs and adversely affected our liquidity.
We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last or if it will reoccur even after the vaccines are widely administered, when government restrictions and mandates will be imposed or lifted, or how quickly, if at all, guests will return to their pre-COVID-19 purchasing behaviors, so we cannot predict how long our results of operations and financial performance will be adversely impacted.
The market in which we compete is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low- and medium-priced fare. We also compete with delivered meal solutions, convenience stores, grocery stores and other restaurant retailers, including "ghost" or dark kitchens, where meals are prepared at separate premises rather than at a restaurant. Competition from food delivery services has also increased in recent years, particularly during COVID-19.
Pollo Tropical's competitors include national and regional chicken-based concepts as well as other types of quick-service and fast-casual restaurants. Our Taco Cabana restaurants compete with Mexican concepts, including those in the quick-service, fast-casual and casual dining segments. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing, and trends in the restaurant industry more quickly or effectively than we can. Additionally, to remain competitive, we have increasingly offered selected food items and combination meals at discounted prices. These pricing and other marketing strategies have had, and in the future may have, a negative impact on our sales and earnings. If our marketing efforts are unsuccessful, or if our restaurants are unable to compete effectively, our operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted.
Factors applicable to the quick-service and fast-casual restaurant segments may adversely affect our results of operations, which may cause a decrease in earnings and revenues.
The quick-service and fast-casual restaurant segments are highly competitive and can be materially adversely affected by many factors, including:
•changes in local, regional or national economic conditions; 
•changes in demographic trends; 
•changes in consumer tastes; 
•changes in traffic patterns; 
•increases in fuel prices and utility costs; 
•consumer concerns about health, diet and nutrition; 
•instances of food-borne or localized illnesses or other food safety issues;
•increases in the number of, and particular locations of, competing restaurants; 
•changes in discretionary consumer spending; 
•inflation; 
•availability of key commodities such as beef, chicken, eggs and produce;
•increases in the cost of key commodities, such as beef, chicken, eggs and produce as well as the cost of paper goods and packaging; 
•the availability of hourly-paid employees and experienced restaurant managers including a decrease in the labor supply due to changes in immigration policy such as barriers for entry into, working in, or remaining in the United States;
•increased labor costs, including higher wages, unemployment insurance, unionization of restaurant employees and overtime requirements;
•increases in the cost of providing healthcare and related benefits to employees, including the impact of the Affordable Care Act; 
•costs related to remaining competitive and current with regard to new technologies in our restaurants such as loyalty programs, gift cards, online ordering and credit card security; and
•regional weather conditions including hurricanes, windstorms and flooding, and other natural disasters.
Our continued growth depends on our ability to open and operate new restaurants profitably, which in turn depends on our continued access to capital, and newly developed restaurants may not perform as we expect and there can be no assurance that our growth and development plans will be achieved.
While we have decreased the number of new restaurants which we plan to open in the near term, our continued growth still depends on our ability to develop additional Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants. Development involves substantial risks, including the following:
•developed restaurants that do not achieve desired revenue or cash flow levels or other operating and performance targets once opened; 
•the inability to recruit and retain managers and other employees necessary to staff each new restaurant; 
•incurring substantial unrecoverable costs in the event a development project is abandoned prior to completion or a new restaurant is closed due to poor financial performance; 
•changes in general economic and business conditions;
•the inability to fund development; 
•increasing development costs or development costs that exceed budgeted amounts; 
•delays in completion of construction; 
•the inability to obtain all necessary zoning and construction permits; 
•the inability to identify, or the unavailability of, suitable sites on acceptable leasing or purchase terms; and
•changes in governmental rules and regulations or enforcement thereof.
Our long-term development plans will require additional management, operational and financial resources. For example, we will be required to recruit managers and other personnel for each new restaurant. We cannot ensure that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively and our failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations. 
In addition, to maintain our competitive positioning and improve our sales and overall performance, we continue to look at ways to improve our existing restaurants through remodels, upgrades and regular maintenance. If the costs associated with these activities are higher than projected, restaurants are closed for periods longer than anticipated or such remodels do not perform as forecasted, we may not realize an acceptable return on investment, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.
In addition, our ability to open new restaurants and to grow, as well as our ability to meet other anticipated capital needs, may depend on our continued access to external financing, including borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the "senior credit facility." There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital we need at acceptable terms or at all, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, our need to manage our indebtedness levels to ensure continued compliance with financial leverage ratio covenants under our new senior credit facility may reduce our ability to develop new restaurants. 
Customer preferences and traffic could be adversely impacted by health concerns about certain food products, reports of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues, any of which could result in a decrease in demand for our products.
Customer preferences and traffic could be adversely impacted by health concerns or negative publicity about the consumption of particular food products, which could cause a decline in demand for those products and adversely impact our sales.
Instances or reports, whether verified or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service and fast-casual restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages.
These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as norovirus or hepatitis A), and injuries caused by the presence of foreign material could require us to temporarily close our restaurants. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants, could subject us or our suppliers to a food recall pursuant to the United States Food and Drug Administration's recently enacted Food Safety Modernization Act.
Changes in consumer tastes may reduce the frequency of their visits to our restaurants which could negatively impact our business.
We obtain a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of foods that are characterized as tropical- and Mexican-inspired and if consumer preferences for these types of foods change, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, numerous companies in the industry have introduced products positioned to capitalize on the growing consumer preference for food products that are, or are perceived to be, promoting good health, nutritious, fresh, local, clean and all-natural, free from artificial ingredients, minimally processed, low in calories and low in fat content. Our inability to continue to respond to customer demand or changes in customer taste and preferences could require us to change our pricing, marketing, or promotional strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial results or the brand identity that we have created.
An increase in food costs could adversely affect our operating results.
Our profitability and operating margins are dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs. Changes in the cost or availability of certain food products could affect our ability to offer a broad menu and maintain competitive prices and could materially adversely affect our profitability and reputation. The type, variety, quality and cost of produce, beef, poultry, cheese and other commodities can be subject to change and to factors beyond our control, including weather, governmental regulation, availability and seasonality, each of which may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply. Although we utilize purchasing contracts to lock in the prices for a material portion of the food commodities used in our restaurants, some of the commodities used in our operations cannot be locked in for periods longer than one month. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk against market fluctuations in the price of commodities at this time. We may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs through our purchasing practices and menu price adjustments in the future, and failure to do so could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.
We could also be adversely affected by price increases specific to ingredients we have chosen due to their specific quality profile or related criteria, the markets for which are generally smaller and more concentrated than the markets for other commodity food products.
If a significant disruption in service or supply by any of our suppliers or distributors were to occur, it could create disruptions in the operations of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our restaurants depend on frequent deliveries of ingredients and other products. For both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants, we have service agreements with our primary distributors of food and paper products. Performance Food Group, Inc., is our primary distributor of food and beverage products and supplies for both our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under a distribution services agreement that expires on July 27, 2024. We also currently rely on five suppliers for chicken for our Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants under agreements that expire on December 31, 2021. There are many factors which could cause shortages or interruptions in the supply of our ingredients and products, including adverse weather, unanticipated demand, labor or distribution problems, food safety issues by our suppliers or distributors, cost, and the financial health of our suppliers. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, this could increase our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If such actions were to occur, customers could change their dining habits and affected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter.
A substantial portion of our senior management team is new, which may pose challenges, and our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
Dirk Montgomery and Hope Diaz joined us as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Marketing Officer, respectively, in September 2019, and we added a new Chief Information Officer, John Doyle in December 2019, and Louis DiPietro, our Chief Legal and People Officer, in December 2018. This followed the hiring of our current Chief Executive Officer, Richard Stockinger, in March 2017. These officers have hired, and are expected in the future to hire, a number of new direct reports, and as a result, our senior management team is relatively new and may face challenges working together as a unit, aligning on strategic priorities and objectives, or integrating their new teams with one another. Failure to meet these challenges successfully may adversely impact our operations, business results or long-term growth prospects.
If there is a lack of sufficient labor or labor costs increase, our operating results may be adversely affected.
Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, because of increased competition for employees, a decrease in the labor supply to us or our key suppliers due to changes in immigration policy including barriers to immigrants entering, working in, or remaining in the United States, higher employee-turnover rates, unionization of restaurant workers, or changes in federal, state, or local laws, including those related to prevailing wages or in other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers' compensation insurance), this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase. Potential changes in labor laws could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs.
The success of our marketing programs and the impact of those of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
If our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotions, or our advertising and other marketing programs do not result in increased net sales or if the costs of advertising, media, or marketing increase greater than expected, or are less effective than our competitors, our profitability could be materially adversely affected. 
Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.
There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and others. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.
Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance. As part of our 
marketing efforts, going forward we expect to increasingly rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests. We will also increase our investment in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to our brands. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.
Cybersecurity breaches or other privacy or data security incidents that expose confidential guest, personal employee and other material, confidential information that is stored in our systems in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions or security breaches of confidential employee information that is stored in our systems or by third parties on our behalf may adversely affect our business.
We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, gift and loyalty cards, online business, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the preparation and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. We expect to expand our utilization of technology throughout our business and the failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause reduced efficiency of our operations, and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem which could adversely affect our business. Any intentional attack or an unintentional event that results in unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal or expose confidential information or intellectual property that compromises the information of our guests or employees could result in widespread negative publicity, damage to our reputation, a loss of guests, disruption of our business and legal liabilities. As our reliance on technology has grown, the scope and severity of risks posed to our systems from cyber threats has increased. In addition, as more business activities have shifted online and more people are working remotely, including as a result of COVID-19, we have experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks. The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, malware and other events that could have a security impact; however there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective.
A significant amount of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their guests has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests' credit or debit card information. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.
From time to time we have been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. We may in the future become subject to other legal proceedings or governmental investigations for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our consumers' credit or debit card information or if consumer or employee information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately. Any such claim or proceeding, or any adverse publicity resulting from such an event, may have a material adverse effect on our business and we may incur significant remediation costs.
Such breaches also could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations which require companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data and provide a private right of action for data breaches. These laws also typically require companies that process information on customers to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and the right for consumers to request deletion of personal information. If we become subject to such laws in the markets in which we operate and we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party's information technology systems or fail to properly respond to consumer requests under such laws, we could experience reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
Compliance with current and future applicable privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. We make significant investments in technology, third-party services and internal personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. In addition, media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred.
Our digital business, which we expect to grow as a percentage of sales, is subject to risks.
In 2020, we saw an increase in the number of digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup. The growth in digital orders is, in part, attributable to more guests dining at home due to COVID-19, our expanded partnerships with multiple third-party delivery services and our investments in our overall digital strategies. Depending on which ordering platform a digital order is placed—our platform or the platform of a third-party delivery service—the delivery fee we collect from the guest may be less than the actual delivery cost, which has a negative impact on our profitability. While we have implemented a menu price increase to partially offset higher delivery costs, this higher menu prices may cause some guests to shift their purchases to other restaurants offered on the platform. As our digital business grows, we are increasingly reliant on third-party delivery companies, which maintain control over data regarding guests that use their platform and over the customer experience. If a third-party delivery company driver fails to make timely deliveries or fails to deliver the complete order, our guests may attribute the bad customer experience to our brands and could stop ordering from us. The ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties, or our mobile app or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our overall sales and reputation. The third-party delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of players competing for market share, online traffic capital, and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery companies we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted. The delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate, and fewer third-party delivery companies may give them more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts, which could negatively impact our profits from delivery orders.
Our business is regional, and we therefore face risks related to reliance on certain markets as well as risks for other unforeseen events.
As of January 3, 2021, all of our Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants were located in Florida and all of our Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants were located in Texas. Furthermore, 68% of our Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants were located in three counties in Florida which represents a significant amount of the brand's sales and Restaurant-level Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, events and conditions specific to these regions, including economic conditions, state and local government regulations, weather conditions or other conditions affecting Florida and Texas, and the tourism industry in Florida, may have a material impact on the success of our restaurants in those locations.
Adverse weather conditions have impacted, and could in the future impact, guest traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes or other natural disasters, cause temporary closures, sometimes for prolonged periods, which would negatively impact our restaurant sales. Changes in weather could result in construction delays, interruptions to the availability of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies, which could increase our costs and could adversely impact our business. Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations.
Economic downturns may adversely impact consumer spending patterns.
Our business is dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, particularly those that affect our guests that frequently patronize our restaurants. In particular, where our business is subject to factors which could reduce our guests' disposable income (such as by job losses, credit constraints and higher housing, tax, utility, gas, consumer credit or other costs) or where the perceived wealth of guests has decreased (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, lower investment values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates, social unrest, or other economic disruptions and governmental, political and budget concerns), our restaurants have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, lower sales and guest traffic as guests choose lower-cost alternatives or choose alternatives to dining out. The resulting decrease in our guest traffic or average sales per transaction has had an adverse effect in the past, and could in the future have a material adverse effect, on our business. In addition, a new presidential and legislative administration recently took office and it is unknown what impact any changes made by this administration or policies implemented will have on the economy or restaurant spending. 
Our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to a lack of market awareness of our brands.
We have encountered and may continue to encounter difficulties developing restaurants outside of our more mature core markets. For example, we closed all Pollo Tropical restaurants in Texas, Tennessee and Georgia over the last three years. We may be unable to find attractive locations or successfully market our products as we attempt to expand beyond our existing markets, as the competitive circumstances and consumer characteristics in these new areas may differ substantially from those in areas in which we currently operate. It may be more challenging for us to attract guests to our restaurants in areas where there is a limited or a lack of market awareness of the Pollo Tropical or Taco Cabana brand. Restaurants opened in new markets where we have not reached media efficiency may open at lower sales volumes than restaurants opened in more mature markets, and may have lower restaurant-level operating margins than more mature markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets that are not yet media efficient have taken and may continue to take longer to reach average restaurant sales volumes, if at all, thereby adversely affecting our operating results, including the recognition of future impairment charges. Opening new restaurants in areas in which potential guests may not be familiar with our restaurants may include costs related to the opening and marketing of those restaurants that are substantially greater than those incurred by our restaurants in other areas. Even though we may incur substantial additional costs with respect to these new restaurants, they may attract fewer guests than our more established restaurants in existing markets. We may also not open a sufficient number of restaurants in new markets to adequately leverage distribution, supervision and marketing costs. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot ensure that we will be able to operate our new restaurants successfully or profitably outside our existing markets.
Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future results of operations.
New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.
Government regulation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In connection with the operation of our business, we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations that are complex and vary from location to location, including those related to:
•franchise relationships;
•building construction and zoning requirements;
•nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements;
•management and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers; and
•environmental matters.
Our restaurants are licensed and subject to regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, including business, health, fire, sales of alcohol and safety codes. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.
In addition, new government initiatives or changes to existing laws, such as the adoption and implementation of national, state, or local government proposals relating to increases in minimum wage rates, may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations.
Our failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.
Various federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classification as exempt/non-exempt for overtime and other purposes, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, immigration status and other wage and benefit requirements. In addition, states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider and may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Some of these changes may increase our obligations for 
compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the E-Verify program, an Internet-based, free program run by the United States government to verify employment eligibility, in states in which participation is required. However, use of the E-Verify program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who were unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. 
Although we believe that compliance with these laws has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date, we may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with such laws in the future. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. For example, lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime, meal and rest breaks, employee classification, employee record-keeping and related practices with respect to our employees. We may incur legal costs to defend such lawsuits, and we could suffer losses from, these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. 
In addition, the amount that we pay our restaurant employees will likely be impacted by minimum wage laws. To the extent implemented, federal, state, and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandates or impact other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. For example, the state of Florida recently approved a minimum wage increase effective in September of 2021 which will increase the minimum wage gradually over a period of five years. As other jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices depends on the willingness of our guests to pay higher prices and recognize our perceived value relative to competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wage, benefit standards and compliance costs, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
Additionally, while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become covered by collective bargaining agreements, our labor costs could increase, and it could negatively impact our culture and reduce our flexibility to attract and retain top performing employees. Labor unions have attempted, and likely will continue to attempt, to attract media attention to their organizing efforts in our restaurants, and their organizing efforts include claims that we mistreat or undervalue our employees. Despite our efforts to provide more accurate information about our policies and practices, these messages may dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants.
If one of our employees sells alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated patron or to a minor, we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron or incur significant fines or penalties.
We serve alcoholic beverages at our restaurants and are subject to the "dram-shop" statutes of the jurisdictions in which we serve alcoholic beverages. "Dram-shop" statutes generally provide that serving alcohol to an intoxicated patron is a violation of the law. 
In most jurisdictions, if one of our employees sells alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated patron we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron. We cannot guarantee that those patrons will not be served or that we will not be subject to liability for their acts. Our liquor liability insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover any potential liability and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or we may face increased deductibles on such insurance. A significant dram-shop claim or claims could have a material adverse effect on us as a result of the costs of defending against such claims; paying deductibles and increased insurance premium amounts; implementing improved training and heightened control procedures for our employees; and paying any damages or settlements on such claims. 
Additionally, we are subject to statutes of the jurisdictions in which we serve alcoholic beverages which prohibit us from selling or serving alcohol to minor patrons. These statutes generally provide that serving or selling alcohol to minors is a violation of the law, and will result in fines and other penalties including the suspension or loss of our license to sell alcohol in the future. If we were to incur a significant number of sale to minor violations the fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on us.
The effect of changes to U.S. health care laws may increase our health care costs and negatively impact our financial results. 
Under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act, changes in the law including the employer mandate and employer penalties may increase our labor costs significantly. While changes in the law, including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain health care coverage, have not resulted in significant numbers of additional employees electing to participate in our health care plans, there can be no assurance that this will not change in the future which may increase our health care costs. It is also possible that making changes or failing to make changes in the health care plans we offer will make us less attractive to our current or potential employees. The costs and other effects of these new health care requirements on future periods cannot be determined with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may incur significant liability or reputational harm if claims are brought against us or against our franchisees.
We or our franchisees may be subject to complaints, regulatory proceedings or litigation from guests or other persons alleging food-related illness, injuries suffered on our premises or other food quality, health, or operational concerns, including environmental claims. In addition, in recent years a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break, meal break and overtime compensation issues and, in the case of certain restaurants, alleging that they have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat or high sodium foods and that their marketing practices have encouraged obesity. We may also be subject to litigation or other actions initiated by governmental authorities, our employees and our franchisees, among others, based upon these and other matters. Adverse publicity resulting from such allegations or occurrences or alleged discrimination or other operating issues stemming from one of our locations, a number of our locations or our franchisees could adversely affect our business, regardless of whether the allegations are true, or whether we are ultimately held liable. Any cases filed against us could materially adversely affect us if we lose such cases and have to pay substantial damages or if we settle such cases. In addition, any such cases may materially and adversely affect our operations by increasing our litigation costs and diverting our attention and resources to address such actions. In addition, if a claim is successful, our insurance coverage may not cover or be adequate to cover all liabilities or losses and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance, or to obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we suffer losses, liabilities or loss of income in excess of our insurance coverage or if our insurance does not cover such loss, liability or loss of income, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
Our franchisees or licensees could take actions that harm our reputation.
As of January 3, 2021, a total of 35 Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana restaurants were owned and operated by our franchisees and licensees. We do not exercise control of the day-to-day operations of our franchisees and licensees and the number of franchised or licensed restaurants may increase in the future. While we attempt to ensure that franchisee-owned and licensee-owned restaurants maintain the same high operating standards as our Company-owned restaurants, one or more of these franchisees or licensees may fail to meet these standards. Any shortcomings at our franchisee-owned and licensee-owned restaurants could be attributed to our company as a whole and could adversely affect our reputation and damage our brands. 
Federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials could expose us to liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous substances or other regulated materials, release of pollutants into the air, soil and water, and the remediation of contaminated sites. 
Failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of fines or penalties, restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts of law, as well as investigatory or remedial liabilities and claims for alleged personal injury or damages to property or natural resources. Some environmental laws impose strict, and under some circumstances joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites on current and prior owners or operators of the sites, as well as those entities that send regulated materials to the sites. We cannot ensure that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Therefore, our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Major developments on trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
The current political climate has introduced uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations impacting trade between the United States and other countries. We source several of our ingredients, paper products and other materials used within our business from suppliers outside of the United States, including Asia, Central America and Mexico. 
Significant developments in trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on items imported by us, could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial results.
We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.
The leases for our restaurant locations generally have initial terms of 10 to 20 years, and typically provide for renewal options in five-year increments as well as for rent escalations. Generally, our leases are "net" leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases.
From time to time we have, and may in the future, close or relocate a restaurant if a current location becomes less profitable as a result of adverse economic conditions or other factors. If the closures continue for a long period of time, we may not be able to recover our investment due to the high rental rates. Because substantially all of our restaurants operate in leased facilities, we may incur significant lease termination expenses when we close or relocate a restaurant and are often obligated to continue rent and other lease related payments after restaurant closure. We also may incur significant asset impairment and other charges in connection with closures and relocations. If the lease termination cost is significant, we may decide to keep underperforming restaurants open. Ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could decrease our results of operations. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Our failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand.
We own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service mark registrations, including the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana names and logos, and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu offerings. We believe that our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We, therefore, devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property either in print or on the internet, the value of our brands may be harmed which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are aware of restaurants in foreign jurisdictions using menu items, logos or branding that we believe are based on our intellectual property and our ability to prevent these restaurants from using these elements may be limited in jurisdictions in which we are not operating. This could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand into other jurisdictions in the future.
We are not aware of any assertions that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, but we cannot ensure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.
As of January 3, 2021, we had $73.3 million of outstanding indebtedness comprised of $71.5 million of term loan borrowings, net of debt issuance costs and discounts totaling $3.5 million, under our new senior credit facility and finance lease obligations of $1.9 million. 
As a result of our indebtedness, a portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, to the extent we significantly increase our borrowings and interest rates increase under our new senior credit facility, we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to both repay our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs which could adversely affect our financial condition.
Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; 
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
•require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and related interest, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; 
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
•increase our cost of borrowing; 
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and 
•limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes. 
We expect to use cash flow from operations and revolving borrowings under our new senior credit facility to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough money, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including our new senior credit facility, on or before maturity which could adversely impact our business. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness, including the agreements for our new senior credit facility, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.
Despite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur more debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.
We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future. Although our new senior credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although our new senior credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends, we are able to make such restricted payments under certain circumstances. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making restricted payments could intensify the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face. 
Our new senior credit facility restricts our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.
Our new senior credit facility restricts our ability in certain circumstances to, among other things: 
•incur additional debt; 
•pay dividends and make other distributions on, redeem or repurchase, capital stock; 
•make investments or other restricted payments; 
•enter into transactions with affiliates; 
•sell all, or substantially all, of our assets; 
•create liens on assets to secure debt; or 
•effect a consolidation or merger. 
These covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively which could adversely impact our business. In addition, our new senior credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot ensure that we will meet these tests.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and our senior credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
We do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The absence of a dividend on our common stock may increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock or make it more likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease in the event of adverse economic conditions or adverse developments affecting our company. Our new senior credit facility limits, and the debt instruments that we and our subsidiaries may enter into in the future may limit, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We cannot ensure that these analysts will publish research or reports about us or that any analysts that do so will not discontinue publishing research or reports about us in the future. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline rapidly. If analysts do not publish reports about us or if one or more analyst ceases coverage of our stock, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 
Percentage ownership of our common stock may be diluted in the future.
Percentage ownership of our common stock may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees. The Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (and any successor stock incentive plan that we may adopt) provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, and other equity-based awards to our directors, officers and other employees, advisors and consultants. In addition, in the future we may also issue common stock or other securities to raise additional capital. Any new shares issued would dilute our existing shareholders.
Proxy contests threatened or commenced against us could be disruptive and costly, and adversely affect our business, operation results and financial condition.
Stockholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals. Responding to proxy contests and related actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of our management and employees away from their regular duties and the pursuit of our business strategies, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial conditions. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of proxy contests and related actions by activist stockholders may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity. This may affect our relationship with current or potential suppliers, vendors, and other third parties, and make it more difficult to attract and retain management employees and executives which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, proxy contests and related actions by activist stockholders could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.
Delaware corporate law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions: 
•require that special meetings of our stockholders be called only by our board of directors or certain of our officers, thus prohibiting our stockholders from calling special meetings;
•deny holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, meaning that stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common stock will be able to elect all of our directors; 
•authorize the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that our board could issue to dilute the voting and economic rights of our common stock and to discourage a takeover attempt;
•provide the approval of our board of directors or a supermajority of stockholders is necessary to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws and that approval of a supermajority of stockholders is necessary to amend, alter or change certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation;
•establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
•require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing.
