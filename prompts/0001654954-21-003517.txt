ITEM 1.      
BUSINESS.

 
  Overview
  
 Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. (the "Company” or “the Company”) is a Texas corporation formed in 1984 engaged in developing biologics for the treatment of human and animal diseases. Our current focus is research aimed at the treatment of human disease indications, particularly influenza, hepatitis C, thrombocytopenia, and other indications using interferon (IFN) alpha that is administered in a proprietary low-dose non-injectable form. In addition to its core technology the Company is working to expand the Company’s current focus into a diversified healthcare business portfolio in order to generate new revenue streams.
  
 The Company presently owns eight issued patents with two patents pending. This collection consists of patents with claims that encompass method of use or treatment, and/or composition of matter and manufacturing as well as design utility and/or invention. Of the eight issued patents, four patents are related to the low-dose oral delivery of interferon, one patent is for a product promoting oral health, and three patents are associated with treatment of metabolic disorders.
  
 The Company primarily operates three business units: the Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Consumer Product Divisions. Historically, the Company has focused on R&D involving low-dose, orally administered lozenges containing the natural immune system activator interferon-alpha as a treatment for a variety of disease indications. The Company owns a proprietary library of over thirty years of scientific and clinical data on the human and animal applications of low-dose oral interferon. Through the Pharmaceutical Division, the Company seeks to out-license or leverage in other ways its core technology by forming partnerships to develop current and new discoveries and commercialize the resulting products.
  
 An integral part of the company’s operating strategy is to create multiple revenue streams through the implementation of programs (including but not limited to in-licensing) of medical and healthcare products and therapeutics. The Medical Division and Consumer Products Division facilitate the enhancement of these revenue streams. These programs will be the catalysts that allow the Company to enter markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and other Asian countries for the distribution of new medical and healthcare products.

 Over the past several years the Company has focused its research efforts towards the development of a novel pulsatile insulin pump infusion therapy in Taiwan that consists of delivering insulin intravenously in pulses, as opposed to the typical subcutaneous route of administration, in order to more closely imitate how the pancreas secretes insulin in healthy non-diabetics. The Company plans to offer an innovative and comprehensive diabetes treatment that provides solutions to all stages of diabetes from pre-diabetes through late-stage diabetes with advanced complications. The Company intends to target Taiwan first as an R&D base and demonstration platform in Greater China, and subsequently establish a licensing platform for clinics in Greater China. The Consumer Product Division is presently focused on sales of liposomal nutraceuticals and food supplements that include Vitamin C, Glutathione, CoQ10, Curcumin/Resveratrol, DHA, and a Multi-Vitamin.
  
 The Company maintains a representative branch office in Taiwan – Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. (the “Taiwan Branch”) to increase the Company's presence in Taiwan and to serve as an operational hub to access growing Asian markets.
  
 Injectable high-dose interferon is FDA-approved to treat some neoplastic, viral and autoimmune diseases.  Many patients experience moderate to severe side-effects causing them to discontinue injectable interferon therapy. Our core technology is primarily based on low-dose non-injectable interferon-alpha that is delivered into the oral cavity as a lozenge in low doses. The lozenge dissolves in the mouth where interferon binds to surface (mucosal) cells in the mouth and throat, resulting in activation of hundreds of genes in the peripheral blood that stimulate the immune system.  Human studies have shown that oral interferon is safe and effective against viral and neoplastic diseases. Oral interferon is given in concentrations 10,000 times less than that usually given by injection. The Company’s low-dose formulation results in almost no side effects, in contrast to high dose injectable interferon, which causes adverse effects in at least 50% of recipients.
  
 Governmental or FDA approval is required for low-dose oral interferon. We believe that our technology is sound and can be commercialized for various indications. Due to lack of appropriate interferon supply in the market over the past several years, we have been unsuccessful at such commercialization to date. However, as a result of Covid-19, Chinese government health authorities have recommended use of anti-AIDS drugs and interferon. The Company believes this has brought renewed attention in the importance of incorporating low-dose interferon as a treatment to help stem the pandemic. In light of these circumstances, the Company is uniquely positioned to potentially develop safe, low-dose interferon.
  
 While the pharmaceutical industry is creating and marketing new and effective anti-viral medications, there still exists opportunities to develop and commercialize low-dose interferon as a safer anti-viral treatment for influenza, hepatitis, and other conditions caused by viruses such as genital warts and canker sores. Interferon also has powerful cytotoxic effects which in combination with its immune stimulating activities could play a role in the rapidly expanding field of cancer immunotherapy. Other demonstrated effects of interferon offer opportunities to commercialize low-dose interferon for the treatment of Thrombocytopenia and chronic cough in lung diseases such as COPD and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The Company has the opportunity to capitalize on its relationship channels in the Asian markets to explore sources of raw materials, capital, production facilities, and to target a significant and growing sales market.
  
  Recent Business Expansion Opportunity
  
 On December 24, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Ainos Agreement”) with Ainos, Inc., a Cayman Islands corporation (“Purchaser”) and certain principal shareholders of the Company including (i) Stephen T. Chen, individually and as Trustee of the Stephen T. Chen and Virginia M. Chen Living Trust, dated April 12, 2018, (ii) Virginia M. Chen, individually and as Trustee of the Stephen T. Chen and Virginia M. Chen Living Trust, dated April 12, 2018, and (iii) Hung Lan Lee (collectively, “Principal Shareholders”).

 Pursuant to the Ainos Agreement, upon the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Closing”), the Company will acquire certain patent assets (the “Patent Assets”) by issuing 100,000,000 shares of common stock (the “Shares”) valued at $0.20 to Purchaser.  The Patent Assets encompass technologies relating to development and manufacturing of point-of-care testing rapid test kit products that include diagnostics for COVID-19 (SARS CoV2 Antigen Rapid Test), pneumonia, vaginal infection and helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection.  The Company anticipates that the Shares issued to the Purchaser will represent approximately 70.39% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and effect a change of control in the Company at the Closing.  The Ainos Agreement provides for certain registration rights to the Purchaser regarding the Shares. 
  
 The Closing is conditioned on the Company (1) obtaining shareholder approval for, among other things: (i) the adoption of the Ainos Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; (ii) the amendment of the Company’s charter documents to (A) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 300,000,000 shares, and (B) rename the Company to “Ainos, Inc.” or any other corporate name designated by Purchaser and (iii) the expansion of the number of directors on the Company’s Board of Directors (“Company Board”) and the election of directors as designated by the Purchaser (collectively, the “Company Actions Required for Closing”); and (2) file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)_a proxy statement or information statement, which shall include the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company’s shareholders approve the Ainos Agreement and authorize the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Company Board Recommendation”). 
  
 The Ainos Agreement contains certain customary termination rights that are (i) in favor of each of the Company and Purchaser, including by mutual agreement or for uncured breach by the other party and (ii) in favor of Purchaser, including if there is a change of the Company Board Recommendation or, if the Closing has not been consummated by the end of day on the forty-fifty day after the date of the Ainos Agreement, subject to certain limitations. The Ainos Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants obligating the Company to continue to conduct its business in the ordinary course and to cooperate in seeking regulatory approvals, as needed.
  
 Under the Ainos Agreement, the Principal Shareholders agree to be responsible jointly and severally with the Company for the Company’s indemnification obligations provided in the Ainos Agreement and to cause their controlled entities to enter into joinder agreements to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Agreement as a Principal Shareholder prior to the Closing.
  
 The foregoing description of the Ainos Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the agreement, which is included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on December 30, 2020.
  
 On December 18, 2020, the Company Board, and on January 25, 2021, the holders owning a majority of the shares of common stock of the Company as of the record date of January 22, 2021 approved the Company Actions Required for Closing. The Company filed a definitive information statement regarding the majority stockholder approval of the Company Actions Required for Closing on March 19, 2021 and completed mailing of the information statements to its shareholders on March 26, 2021. The Company expects the Closing to occur on or after April 15, 2021, subject to the terms and conditions of the Ainos Agreement.

  Cost of Compliance with Environmental Regulations
  
 The Company incurred no costs to comply with environment regulations in 2020.
  
  United States Regulation
  
 Before products with health claims can be marketed in the United States, they must receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). To receive this approval, any drug must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials that demonstrate the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory process controls, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.
  
   
5


  
 
 In general, before any ethical pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the United States, the FDA will require the following process:
  
 
● | Preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | Pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators; 
● | Submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA; and 
● | FDA approval of an NDA, or of an NDA supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility).


 
 Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials, and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. At such time as the Company undertakes to commercialize any of its products, all necessary preclinical testing, clinical trials, data review, and approval steps will be judiciously executed to insure that the product satisfies all regulatory requirements at all levels.
  
  505(b)(2)
  
 The Company has historically followed and will continue to follow the traditional approval process for New Drugs as set out in Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If an alternative path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products is scientifically and economically feasible and beneficial to the Company and the public, the Company may choose to follow this alternative path as established by section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This section of the Act permits the applicant to rely on certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product as some of the information required for approval and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The process of approval under 505(b)(2) will be followed as judiciously as 505(b)(1) or any regulation.
  
  Orphan Drug Designation
  
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The Company may choose to seek approval for a product satisfying the definition of an Orphan Drug if that product can be used to treat such an indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration or rigidity of the regulatory review and approval process. 
  
 Similarly, substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, design, testing, fabrication and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies for medical devices. The Company may seek to obtain FDA clearance for the sales, marketing, and use of its novel pulsatile insulin pump for the U.S. market after obtaining FDA approvals under one of the following regulatory approvals:
  
  Premarket Notification 510(k)
  
  Each person who intends to market in the U.S., a Class I, II, and III device intended for human use, for which a Premarket Approval application (“PMA”) is not required, must submit a 510(k) to FDA unless the device is exempt from 510(k) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and does not exceed the limitations of exemptions in .9 of the device classification regulation chapters (e.g., 21 CFR 862.9, 21 CFR 864.9).
  
   
6


  
 
 If the Company’s novel pulsatile insulin pump is determined to be similar to one already cleared for the U.S. market, the Company will seek FDA clearance under 510(k) at least 90 days before the device is marketed. A 510(k) application requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is as safe and effective as the predicate. Documented laboratory testing among other submissions will be required and if the Company’s device features significant alterations from predecessor devices the Company may be required to present results from clinical trials.
  
  Premarket Approval (PMA)
  
 Alternatively, if the Company’s device is deemed to be completely new to the U.S. market or classified as a Class III device, the Company will be required to apply for PMA approval. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FD&C Act established three regulatory classes for medical devices. The three classes are based on the degree of control necessary to assure that the various types of devices are safe and effective. The most regulated devices are in Class III. The amendments define a Class III device as one that supports or sustains human life or is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or presents a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
  
  Under Section 515 of the FD&C Act, all devices placed into Class III are subject to premarket approval requirements. Premarket approval by FDA is the required process of scientific review to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices.
  
  Foreign Regulation
  
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of products in foreign countries. Whether or not the Company obtains FDA approval for a product, the Company must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before the Company can commence clinical trials or market the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
  
 The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of investigational drugs or approval of new diseases for existing products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. It is not possible to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
  
  Research and Development
  
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred $40,389 of which $40,000 was paid in stock and $389 in cash, towards research, development and IP protection related activities associated entirely with the development of a proprietary pulsatile insulin treatment. Other than corporate administrative and professional accounting fees related to maintaining public listing requirements, a significant portion, if not all, of the Company’s Selling, General & Administrative expenses were also allocated towards the research and development of the Company’s pulsatile insulin treatment pump.
