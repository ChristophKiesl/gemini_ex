Item 1. Business
Introduction
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company formed on January 6, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in effecting our initial business combination.
We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
On June 15, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 5,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit (the “Public Units’), generating gross proceeds of $50,000,000. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and three-quarters of one warrant. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 250,000 units at $10.00 per unit (the “Private Units”), in a private placement to our sponsor, hedge funds and the representatives of underwriters and certain of their affiliates, generating gross proceeds of $2,500,000.
On June 28, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 467,000 Public Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,670,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option, we sold additional 11,675 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit to the above-mentioned purchasers in a private placement, generating gross proceeds to us of $116,750.
Upon the consummation of the IPO and the underwriters’ partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and associated private placements, $54,670,000 of cash was placed in the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of our initial business combination and (ii) our failure to consummate a business combination by September 15, 2022.
If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by September 15, 2022, or 15 months from the closing of our IPO, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the warrants will be worthless.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1.07 billion, or the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Business Strategy
Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region. We believe that there are a range of target businesses that could benefit from our industry knowledge, relationships, capital and public vehicle. We intend to execute a business combination and ultimately create returns for our shareholders through organic growth or / and follow-on acquisitions.
Competitive Strengths
Our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and their professional contacts and transaction sources will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities.

Our management team is led by Mr. Deyin (Bill) Chen. We will seek to capitalize on the significant contacts and experience of our management team, including Bill Chen, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laura Li, our Chief Financial Officer and director, and H. David Sherman, Jianzhong Lu and Yan Zhu, each a member of our board of directors. Our team consists of seasoned and experienced professionals who have experience in equity investments, finance, business operations and management, as well as deal negotiation. We believe our team has the ability to source attractive deals and find good investment opportunities from private and public sources in their networks. Bill Chen has a mixed background of engineering, finance, and operation management across industries and continents. He has established a strong network of investment institutions and business connections, which we believe can help us to identify attractive targets and negotiate a transaction that benefits our shareholders. Other members of our management also have extensive experience in sourcing and evaluating potential investment targets, and have developed a proprietary network of business leaders, investors and intermediaries that we believe can generate deal flow for us. H. David Sherman is a professor at Northeastern University specializing in financial and management accounting, with experience serving on the board and as audit committee chair for several public companies, including Dunxin Financial Holdings Ltd. (AMEX: DXF), Kingold Jewelry Inc. (NASDAQ: KGJI), and China HGS Real Estate Inc. (NASDAQ: HGSH). Professor Sherman was an Academic Fellow at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Division of Corporate Finance’s Office of Chief Accountant. Jianzhong Lu is a financial expert with over thirty years of experience on listed companies, including auditing, due diligence, internal control, risk management and budget management. He was previously an Audit Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. With their support, we intend to conduct a disciplined process of deal origination and evaluation, due diligence, and investment.
Our management team’s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.
Effecting an Acquisition Transaction
Our acquisition strategy will be to capitalize on the strengths of our management team to allow us to identify businesses that have the capacity for cash flow creation, opportunity for operational improvement, robust company fundamentals, and qualified and driven management teams. Our deal sourcing process will leverage our management team’s business knowledge, industry expertise and deep network of relationships that we expect will provide us with a pipeline of acquisition candidates. Moreover, we anticipate introductions to potential acquisition candidates through various unaffiliated sources, including venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, investment bankers, management buyout funds, and other members of the financial community, as well as attorneys and accountants. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or completing the business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment-banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Our efforts to identify a potential target business will not be limited to a specific industry or geographic region.
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination may have been materially and adversely affected or may be so affected in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extended period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.

We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon such consummation and, if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company.
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all.
Our initial shareholders and officers and directors have agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to redeem any shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or any amendment to our charter prior to the consummation of our initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination.
None of our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to any units or ordinary shares from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a general meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against a proposed business combination, or choose to convert their shares, our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates could make purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence any vote held to approve a proposed initial business combination or to increase the likelihood of satisfying any closing conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock, shares or other equity securities.
Redemption Rights
At any general meeting called to approve an initial business combination, any public shareholder (whether they are voting for or against such proposed business combination or not voting at all) will be entitled to demand that his, her or its ordinary shares be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account less amounts necessary to pay our taxes).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 20% or more of the ordinary shares sold in the IPO without our prior written consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in the IPO) for or against our initial business combination.

Whether we elect to effectuate our initial business combination via shareholder vote or tender offer, we will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option prior to the expiration of the tender offer, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the general meeting ensures that a holder’s election to redeem his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise redemption rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
Liquidation if no business combination
If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of ordinary shares and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the company, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.
In connection with our redemption of 100% of our issued and outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, each public shareholder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us and less up to $50,000 for liquidation expenses. Holders of warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such warrants, which will expire worthless.
The holders of the founder shares and private units will not participate in any redemption distribution with respect to their founder shares or private units, until all of the claims of any redeeming shareholders and creditors are fully satisfied (and then only from funds held outside the trust account).
If we are unable to conclude our initial business combination and we expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO not deposited in the trust account, without taking into account any interest earned on the trust account, we expect that the initial per-share redemption price will be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of our shareholders. In addition, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. Therefore, the actual per-share redemption price may be less than approximately $10.00.
We will pay the costs of liquidating the trust account from the up to $50,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that is available to us for liquidation expenses.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Facilities
We currently maintain our executive offices at Suite A-2F, 555 Shihui Road, Songjiang District, Shanghai, China 201100. Such space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services are provided to us free of charge by our sponsor. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
