Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “RPT,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to RPT Realty, RPT Realty, L.P., and/or their subsidiaries, as the context may require. The content of our website and the websites of third parties noted herein is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General
RPT Realty owns and operates a national portfolio of open-air shopping destinations principally located in top U.S. markets. The Company's shopping centers offer diverse, locally-curated consumer experiences that reflect the lifestyles of their surrounding communities and meet the modern expectations of the Company's retail partners. The Company is a fully integrated and self-administered REIT publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). The common shares of beneficial interest of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “common shares”), are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RPT”. As of December 31, 2020, our property portfolio consisted of 49 shopping centers (including five shopping centers owned through a joint venture) (the “aggregate portfolio”) representing 11.9 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  As of December 31, 2020, the Company's pro-rata share of the aggregate portfolio was 92.8% leased.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1002, New York, New York 10036 and its telephone number is (212) 221-1261. The Company’s website is rptrealty.com.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, RPT Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”).  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all of our properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 97.7% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP Units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.
Impact of COVID-19
The Company is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on our business, our tenants, our vendors and our partners. The following summary is intended to provide shareholders with information pertaining to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and management’s strategy and actions to respond to these impacts. Unless otherwise specified, the statistical and other information regarding the Company’s portfolio and tenants included in this subsection are based on information available to the Company and includes its consolidated properties and its pro-rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures. Due to the uncertainty and rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19 situation, the Company anticipates that any such statistics and information will potentially change significantly. As a result, the information provided may not be indicative of the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for the year-ended December 31, 2020 and future periods.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused significant market volatility and adverse impacts on the U.S. retail market, the U.S. economy, the global economy, and financial markets. In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, federal, state and local governments have issued recommendations and mandatory business closures, quarantines, restrictions on travel and “shelter-in-place” or “stay at home” orders and social distancing protocols. These measures have impacted our tenants in various ways based upon their business classifications. For example, many jurisdictions have permitted only “essential” businesses to continue to fully operate, have required all “non-essential” businesses to cease or significantly modify operations and have limited restaurants to take-out and delivery services. While the Company is actively monitoring each jurisdiction's plans, it is impossible to predict when restrictions will be partially or completely lifted or relaxed, when tenants will fully re-open or what restrictions will remain in place when re-opening occurs, how such re-opening restrictions will continue to impact, or the effect of any re-opening or relaxation of such restrictions or the adoption of a vaccine will have on, the business of our tenants and whether consumer demand and spending will return to the same levels as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted the Company's properties and tenants by these and other factors as follows:
•100% of the Company's 49 shopping centers remain open and operating as of February 10, 2021.
•94% of our total tenants were open and operating, on a pro-rata basis, as of February 10, 2021 based on Annualized Base Rent (“ABR”).
•67% of the Company’s properties by ABR had a grocery or grocer component and 87% of ABR stemmed from national or regional tenants, on a pro-rata basis, as of December 31, 2020.
•91% of fourth quarter 2020 rents have been paid, on a pro-rata basis, as of February 10, 2021.
•6% of fourth quarter 2020 rents are subject to signed or approved deferral agreements, on a pro-rata basis, as of February 10, 2021.
The Company has taken a number of proactive measures to maintain the strength of its business and manage the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s operations and liquidity, including the following:
•The health and safety of our employees and their families, our tenants and our shopping center customers is our priority. Employees were required to work from home pursuant to the Company's pre-existing work-from-home infrastructure already in-place, mitigating concerns regarding the loss of employee productivity, cybersecurity concerns, and greater difficulty in maintaining internal controls over financial reporting.
•The Company maintains continuous communication with its tenants and is providing resources and assisting tenants in identifying local, state and federal aid that may be available to support their businesses and employees during the pandemic. The Company created a dedicated COVID-19 page containing resources for tenants, including with respect 
to information on the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, including the historic Paycheck Protection Program, and Families First Coronavirus Response Act; information on the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan and debt relief programs and references to state-by-state resources to help our tenants understand specific directives that may impact their businesses. 
•During the second quarter of 2020, the Company completed a workforce reduction and instituted temporary compensation reductions for the executive officers ranging from 10% to 20% of their annual base salaries. Certain executive officers also agreed to further reductions of 10% to 20% of their annual base salaries in exchange for restricted common shares with an equal value.
•To enhance its liquidity position and maintain financial flexibility, the Company borrowed $225.0 million on its unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has repaid $125.0 million of this borrowing leaving $100.0 million outstanding. On February 12, 2021, the Company repaid the remaining $100.0 million outstanding.
•The Company has taken proactive measures to manage liquidity, by suspending the Company’s shopping center acquisition and disposition activity until further notice with no transactions made since December 31, 2019. We have suspended all new development and redevelopment project starts until further notice and currently have no committed development or redevelopment projects in progress. Further, the Company started deferring all but essential maintenance capital expenditures in early March.
•In light of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Trustees temporarily suspended the quarterly common dividend to retain cash starting with the second quarter of 2020. On February 11, 2021, the Company's Board of Trustees reinstated the first quarter 2021 common dividend at $0.075 per share payable on April 1, 2021, to the holders of record of Common Shares as of the close of business on March 19, 2021.
•We paid our first quarter dividend in the amount of $19.4 million on April 1, 2020, to shareholders of record as of March 20, 2020.
•We paid our fourth quarter preferred dividend in the amount of $1.7 million on January 4, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 18, 2020. The Company anticipates it will continue to pay its preferred stock dividend.
The Company’s predominant source of revenue is from rents and reimbursable expenses received from tenants pursuant to lease agreements. Therefore, the Company’s financial results may be adversely impacted in the event our tenants are unable to make rental payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability of tenants to pay rent is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted based upon the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude, duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also experienced a slow-down in leasing activity since March 2020 caused by uncertainty and tenant concern related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While January 2020 and February 2020 leasing activity was relatively consistent with historical levels, the volume of new leasing activity has since slowed. As a result, the full impact of COVID-19 on our business is currently unknown. Our strong balance sheet and operational flexibility allowed us to successfully manage through the initial impact of COVID-19 while protecting our cash flow and liquidity. The factors described above, as well as additional factors that the Company may not currently be aware of, could materially negatively impact the Company’s ability to collect rent and could lead to tenant bankruptcies, rejection of tenant leases in bankruptcy, difficulties in renewing or re-leasing retail space, difficulties in accessing capital, impairment of the Company’s assets and other effects that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to shareholders. See “Risk Factors” in this report.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be a dominant shopping center owner, with a focus on the following:
•Own and manage high quality open-air shopping centers predominantly concentrated in the top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (“MSA”);
•Curate our real estate to maximize its value while being aligned with the future of the shopping center industry by leveraging technology, optimizing distribution points for brick-and-mortar and e-commerce purchases, engaging in best-in-class sustainability programs and developing a personalized appeal to attract and engage the next generation of shoppers;
•Increase the value of our properties and create long-term value and growth for our shareholders;
•Cultivate value creation redevelopment and expansion pipeline; 
•Maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility; 
•Maximize revenue by leasing to a strong and diverse tenant mix at increased rent, when possible; and 
•Attract, retain and promote motivated high performing employees.
Key methods to achieve our strategy:
•Deliver above average relative shareholder return and generate outsized consistent and sustainable Same Property Net Operating Income (“Same Property NOI”) and Operating Funds from Operations (“Operating FFO”) per share growth;
•Evaluate select redevelopment projects with significant pre-leasing for which we expect to achieve attractive returns on investment; 
•Sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy and redeploy the proceeds to lease, redevelop and acquire assets in our core and target markets; 
•Achieve lower leverage while maintaining low variable interest rate risk; 
•Maintain strong tenant and retailer relationships to minimize tenant turnover to attract diverse tenancy; and
•Retain access to diverse sources of capital, maintain liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit and minimize the amount of debt maturities in a single year.
Our portfolio consists of community, lifestyle and power center properties tenanted by national and regional chain stores, market-leading supermarkets, as well as a strong lineup of smaller national, regional and local retailers that optimize the overall merchandise mix and reflect the community demographics of each center. Our centers also include entertainment components, including theaters, fitness centers and restaurants, which, in addition to supermarkets, are daily drivers of consumer traffic to our properties. National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Ross Stores and ULTA Salon. Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger, Aldi, and Sprouts. Theater, fitness and restaurant tenants include, among others, Regal Cinema, LA Fitness, Starbucks and Panera. Our shopping centers are primarily located in key growth markets in the 40 largest MSAs in the United States such as Metro Detroit, Cincinnati, Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Tampa/Lakeland, Nashville and Austin.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants' credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk.
During 2020, our properties reported the following leasing activity, which is shown at pro-rata except for number of leasing transactions and square feet:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | Prior Rent/SF (2) | Tenant Improvements/SF (3) | Leasing Commissions/SF
Renewals | 95 | | 893,139 | | $14.08 | $13.50 | $1.07 | $0.03
New Leases - Comparable | 22 | | 69,682 | | $22.58 | $18.80 | $40.83 | $9.73
New Leases - Non-Comparable (4) | 32 | | 153,506 | | $19.26 | N/A | $59.84 | $9.29
Total | 149 | | 1,116,327 | | $15.31 | N/A | $11.53 | $1.89

(1) Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term. 
(2) Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term. 
(3) Includes estimated tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs. Excludes first generation space and leases related to development and redevelopment activity. 
(4) Non-comparable lease transactions include (i) leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months and (ii) leases signed where the previous and current lease do not have a consistent lease structure.
The Company experienced a slow-down in leasing activity beginning in March 2020 caused by uncertainty and tenant concern related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While January 2020 and February 2020 leasing activity was relatively consistent with historical levels, the volume of new leasing activity with respect to newly-leased space slowed thereafter for a portion of the year ended December 31, 2020. Leasing activity since the start of the third quarter of 2020 returned to levels relatively consistent with historical results.
Investing Activities and Significant Transactions
Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments. In addition we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria. We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership. We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings and leasing newly built space.
In December 2020, we sold two land parcels for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.4 million. We had no acquisitions during 2020.
In December 2019, we acquired a 76,000 square foot Target shadow-anchored shopping center in Austin, Texas for $33.9 million. We also sold two shopping centers and one land outparcel for aggregate gross proceeds of $69.4 million in the first half of 2019.
On December 10, 2019, we contributed five properties valued at $244.0 million to a newly formed joint venture with an affiliate of GIC Private Limited (“GIC”), Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, referred to as R2G Venture LLC (“R2G”), and received $118.3 million in gross proceeds for the 48.5% stake in R2G that was acquired by GIC. Additionally, GIC committed up to $200.0 million of additional capital to R2G over a three year period to fund its 48.5% share of up to an aggregate of $412.4 million of potential acquisitions by R2G of grocery-anchored shopping centers in target markets in the U.S. RPT retained a 51.5% stake in R2G and receives property management, construction management and leasing fees from R2G. The Company is responsible for the day-to-day management of the properties as well as sourcing future acquisitions for R2G. Both GIC and RPT will have consent rights for all future acquisitions, and GIC has approval rights in connection with annual budgets and other specified major decisions. During the three year investment period for R2G, RPT has agreed to present all opportunities above a specified size threshold to acquire grocery-anchored shopping centers in attractive-high growth markets in the United States to R2G and not to acquire, invest in or source any such opportunities that have not previously been presented to R2G and declined by GIC.
Unless specified events occur, neither RPT nor GIC has the right to force a sale of R2G or its assets within the first five years following its formation. Thereafter, both RPT and GIC will have forced sale rights, subject to a right to participate in the purchase for the other member.
Refer to Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost.  In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties, maintaining a well-laddered debt maturity profile and primarily borrowing on an unsecured basis.  In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and REITs in general.  
During the fourth quarter 2020 we obtained an investment grade credit rating from a nationally recognized credit rating agency.
Debt
On November 6, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “credit agreement”), which consists of an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $350.0 million (the “revolving credit facility”) and term loan facilities of $310.0 million (the “term loan facilities” and, together with the revolving credit facility, the “unsecured revolving line of credit”). The revolving credit facility matures on November 6, 2023 and can be extended up to one year to 2024 through two six-month options, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075%. Borrowings on the revolving credit facility are priced on a leverage grid ranging from LIBOR plus 105 basis points to LIBOR plus 150 basis points. 
The term loan facilities mature in five separate tranches ranging from March 2023 to February 2027 and are priced on a leverage grid ranging from LIBOR plus 120 basis points to LIBOR plus 220 basis points. The credit agreement allows for the right to request increases in the revolving and term loan commitments or the making of additional term loans by up to an additional $340.0 million to a maximum aggregated amount not to exceed $1.0 billion. 
In March 2020, the Company borrowed $225.0 million on its revolving credit facility in order to enhance its liquidity position and maintain financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has repaid $125.0 million leaving $100.0 million outstanding. At December 31, 2020 we had $250.0 million available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants. See “Debt” section in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” below for additional discussion regarding the Company's outstanding financial covenants and related amendments thereto. On February 12, 2021, the Company repaid the remaining $100.00 million outstanding on the unsecured revolving line of credit.
On June 30, 2020, the Company entered into amendments to the note purchase agreements governing all of the Company's outstanding senior unsecured notes. The following is a summary of the material amendments:
•The occupancy tests relating to the minimum ratio of consolidated total unencumbered asset value to unsecured indebtedness were eliminated during the period from June 30, 2020 through and including September 30, 2021 (the “Specified Period”) and were otherwise reduced during the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022;
•The minimum ratio of consolidated total unencumbered asset value to unsecured indebtedness that the Operating Partnership is required to maintain was reduced during the Specified Period; and
•The Operating Partnership agreed to a minimum liquidity requirement during the Specified Period.
Equity
In February 2020, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (“Equity Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, the Company's common shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $100.0 million. Sales of the shares of common stock may be made, in the Company's discretion, from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Equity Distribution Agreement also provides that the Company may enter into forward contracts for shares of its common stock with forward sellers and forward purchasers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not issue any common shares through the arrangement. As of December 31, 2020, we have full capacity remaining under the agreement. The sale of such shares issuable pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement was registered with the SEC pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed in February 2020 and the accompanying base prospectus statement forming part of the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-232007) which was filed with the SEC in June 2019.
Sustainability
We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability, with a focus on achieving goals in each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) areas of sustainability. We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of supporting our primary goal to maximize value for our shareholders. 
See “Human Capital” section below for a discussion of our programs related to the Social area of sustainability. 
In 2020, we expanded our ESG polices to broaden our impact on sustainability initiatives. We established a long-term goal to reduce our green-house gases, supplementing our existing long-term goals of electricity consumption reduction, lowering water usage and waste diversion. In 2020, we filed RPT’s first Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, providing more transparency regarding our sustainability polices, initiatives and performance.
Human Capital
We employed 105 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees are represented by a competitive bargaining unit, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives and our corporate purpose of Turning Commercial Ground into Common Ground. RPT is committed to continually building upon a culture that promotes empowerment, transparency and excellence and we strive to make RPT an inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. To facilitate the attraction, retention and promotion of a talented and diverse workforce, we provide competitive compensation, best in class benefits and health and wellness programs, and by championing programs that build connections between our employees and the communities where they live and at the properties we own. 
Our comprehensive benefits package offers flexible and convenient health and wellness options such as health insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, parental leave and family care resources. Throughout the pandemic we have emphasized the importance of mental wellness and have offered several virtual healthcare options. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our associates by encouraging work-life balance through RPT Remote, our flexible work initiative, and sponsoring various wellness programs and corporate challenges, whereby employees are encouraged to incorporate healthy habits into their daily routines. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes requiring our employees to work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing to work on-site and those returning to the office upon reopening as permitted by applicable government mandates. Additionally, RPT supports philanthropical initiatives and partners with organizations that are committed to improving the overall quality of life in our communities. Each month, we support a local community organization through charitable giving or volunteerism. We also provide competitive compensation packages to our employees. In addition to base salaries, these packages include annual bonuses, stock awards and participation in a 401(k) Plan as well as investments in our employees through professional development programs. Finally, in 2020 RPT demonstrated its commitment to maintaining an inclusive and safe work environment through unconscious bias training of all employees and the formation of a committee to oversee the Company’s ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Competition
We compete with many other entities for the acquisition of shopping centers and land suitable for new developments, including other REITs, private institutional investors and other owner-operators of shopping centers.  In particular, larger REITs may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.  These competitors may increase the market prices we would have to pay in order to acquire properties.  If we are unable to acquire properties that meet our criteria at prices we deem reasonable, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.
Our tenants compete with alternate forms of retailing, including on-line shopping, home shopping networks and mail order catalogs.  Alternate forms of retailing may reduce the demand for space in our shopping centers. Because our ability to generate revenue may be connected to the success of our tenants, we indirectly share exposure to these same competitive factors. 
Further, our shopping centers generally compete for tenants with similar properties located in the same neighborhood, community or region.  Although we believe we own high quality centers in desirable geographic locations, competing centers may be newer, better located or have a better tenant mix.  We also believe we compete with other centers on the basis of rental rates and management and operational expertise. In addition, new centers or retail stores may be developed, increasing the supply of retail space competing with our centers or taking retail sales from our tenants.  To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly to enable us to compete effectively. 
Governmental Regulation
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property. In addition to the discussion below regarding certain environmental matters, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances disposed, stored, released, generated, manufactured or discharged from, on, at, onto, under or in such property. Environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substance.
We are not aware of any contamination which may have been caused by us or any of our tenants that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. As part of our risk management activities, we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs, the purpose of which is to expedite and facilitate satisfactory compliance with environmental laws and regulations should contaminants need to be remediated. We also have an environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs. While we believe that we do not have any material exposure to environmental remediation costs, we cannot give assurance that changes in the law or new discoveries of contamination will not result in additional liabilities to us.
Supplemental Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances.
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus supplement, dated February 28, 2020, to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-232007) filed with the SEC on June 7, 2019.
Taxation of the Company
The second sentence of the first paragraph under the heading “Income Tests” is replaced with the following: “First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in “prohibited transactions,” generally must derive from (1) investments in real property or mortgages on real property, including “rents from real property,” dividends received from other REITs, interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by both real and personal property if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all property securing the loans, and gains from the sale of real estate assets, or (2) certain kinds of temporary investment of new capital.”
The second paragraph under the heading “Income Tests” is revised to state: “Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, generally must derive from some combination of such income from investments in real property and temporary investment of new capital (that is, income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above), as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.”
Tax Aspects of Investment in the Operating Partnership
The following paragraphs are added immediately following the first paragraph under the heading “Entity Classification” and thus will become the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the discussion:
In certain situations a partnership (or eligible entity classified as a partnership) may be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes notwithstanding its partnership tax status, including if the entity is a “publicly traded partnership” that does not qualify for an exemption based on the character of its income. A partnership is a “publicly traded partnership” under Section 7704 of the Code if interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market, or interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a “secondary market” or the “substantial equivalent” of a secondary market.
The right of a holder of Operating Partnership units to redeem the units for cash (or common stock at our option) could cause Operating Partnership units to be considered readily tradable on the substantial equivalent of a secondary market. If our Operating Partnership is a publicly traded partnership, it will be taxed as a corporation unless at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year beginning with the first year it is treated as a publicly traded partnership has consisted and will consist of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 of the Code. Qualifying income generally includes real property rents and certain other types of passive income. 
We intend for our Operating Partnership to either qualify for one or more of the safe harbors under the applicable Treasury Regulations to avoid classification as a publicly traded partnership or rely on the qualifying income exception. These safe harbors include among others a safe harbor for a partnership that has no more than 100 partners, and a safe harbor for a “lack of actual trading” if there is a limited volume of certain transfers and redemptions, each of which also have certain additional requirements. While we intend for the Operate Partnership to avoid classification as a publicly traded partnership, it is possible we may not be successful in so complying.”
U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Shareholders
The first bullet point of the first paragraph under the heading “U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Taxable Domestic Shareholders” is revised to state: “An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States as defined in Section 7701(b) of the Code;”.
The following paragraph is inserted immediately following the second paragraph under the heading “Distributions” and thus will become the third paragraph of the discussion:
In general, to qualify for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, a shareholder must hold our stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before the date on which our stock becomes ex-dividend.

Even if our non-U.S. ownership remains under 50% for five years and we otherwise meet the requirements of this rule, pursuant to certain “wash sale” rules under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. shareholder may incur tax under FIRPTA to the extent such shareholder disposes of our stock within a certain period prior to a distribution attributable to USRPI gain on which the shareholder would have been subject to tax under FIRPTA as described above and directly or indirectly (including through certain affiliates) reacquires our stock within certain prescribed periods, provided that this rule will not apply to a 
disposition and reacquisition of our common stock by a non-U.S. shareholder owning, actually or constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of such distribution attributable to USRPI gain.

Fast-Pay Stock
The above summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations does not address any U.S. federal income tax considerations to holders of our then outstanding shares that could result if we issue any redeemable preferred stock at a price that exceeds its redemption price by more than a de minimis amount or that otherwise provides for dividends that are economically a return of the shareholder’s investment (rather than a return on the shareholder’s investment), which preferred stock could be considered “fast-pay stock” under Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 7701(l) of the Code and treated under such regulations as a financing instrument among the holders of the fast-pay stock and our other shareholders.
