Company Overview

GP Strategies Corporation, which is a New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listed company traded under the symbol GPX, is a global performance improvement solutions provider of training, digital learning solutions, management consulting and engineering services. References in this report to “GP Strategies,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” are to GP Strategies Corporation and its subsidiaries, collectively.

We are a global performance improvement and learning solutions provider focused on improving the effectiveness of organizations by delivering innovative and superior training, consulting and business improvement services, customized to meet the specific needs of our clients. We also provide leadership development, sales training, platform adoption, management consulting, engineering and technical services, learning outsourcing and multimedia solutions which enhance our customized learning capabilities and diversify our service offerings. We have global execution capabilities and provide services to a large customer base across a broad range of industries in over 50 countries. We serve leading companies in the automotive, financial services and insurance, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, power, chemical, electronics and technology, manufacturing, software, retail, healthcare, education and food and beverage industries, as well as government agencies. We have over five decades of experience in developing solutions to optimize workforce performance by providing services and products to our clients that assist them in successfully aligning their employees, processes and technologies.

1

We have focused on building our custom performance improvement and learning business through internal growth and the acquisition of complementary businesses. Since 2006, we have completed over 30 acquisitions to strengthen our capabilities in specific training and technical service areas, expand our global presence, and increase our customer base and market sector reach.  As a result, we’ve added product sales training and leadership training, and strengthened our digital learning and content development expertise, while also expanding further internationally. Our acquisitions have also expanded our market sector reach, added new customers and enhanced our service offerings through the addition of new complementary services. We also invested in global expansion through the establishment of over twenty new subsidiaries in select countries since 2013 to support new global outsourcing contracts. We believe our expanded infrastructure and the ability to deliver globally will allow us to better support our existing client base as well as win new business for our comprehensive service offerings. 
In 2019, we divested certain non-core assets. We sold our tuition program management business on October 1, 2019 and our alternative fuels design and engineering business on January 1, 2020.
Operating Segments

As of December 31, 2019, we operated through two reportable business segments: (i) Workforce Excellence and (ii) Business Transformation Services. We are organized into two operating segments aligned by complementary service lines and supported by a business development organization aligned by industry sector. Our two segments each consist of two global practice areas which are focused on providing similar and/or complementary products and services across our diverse customer base and within targeted markets. Within each practice are various service lines having specific areas of expertise. Marketing and communications, sales, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, information systems and other administrative services are organized at the corporate level. Business development and sales resources are aligned by industry sector to support existing customer accounts and new customer development across both segments. 
Workforce Excellence. The Workforce Excellence segment advises and partners with leading organizations in designing, implementing, operating and supporting their talent management and workforce strategies, enabling them to gain greater competitive edge in their markets. This segment consists of two practices:

• | Managed Learning Services - this practice focuses on creating value for our customers by delivering a suite of talent management and learning design, development, operational and support services that can be delivered as large scale outsourcing arrangements, managed services contracts and project-based service engagements. The Managed Learning Services offerings include strategic learning and development consulting services, digital learning content design and development solutions and a suite of managed learning operations services, including: managed facilitation and delivery, managed training administration and logistics, help desk support, event management and vendor management.


• | Engineering & Technical Services - this practice focuses on capital intensive, inherently hazardous and/or highly complex technical services in support of both U.S. government and global commercial industries. Our products and services include design, development and delivery of technical work-based learning, CapEx (plant launch) initiatives, engineering design and construction management, fabrication, and management services, operational excellence consulting, chemical demilitarization services, homeland security services, emergency management support services along with all forms of technical documentation.

We also provide thousands of technical courses in a web-based off-the-shelf delivery format through our GPiLEARN+™ portal. 


Business Transformation Services. The Business Transformation Services segment works with organizations to execute complex business strategies by linking business systems, processes and workforce performance to clear and measurable results. We have a holistic methodology to establishing direction and closing the gap between strategy and execution. Our approach equips business leaders and teams with the tools and capability to deliver high-performance results. This segment consists of two practices:

• | Sales Enablement - this practice provides custom product sales training and service technical training, primarily to automotive manufacturers, designed to better educate customer salesforces as well as service technicians with respect to new product features and designs, in effect rapidly increasing the salesforce and technician knowledge base and enabling them to address retail customer needs. Furthermore, this segment helps our clients assess their customer relationship marketing strategy and connect with their customers on a one-to-one basis, including custom print and digital publications. We have been a custom product sales and service technical training provider and leader in serving manufacturing customers in the U.S. automotive industry for over 40 years.

2


• | Organizational Development - this practice works with organizations to design and execute an integrated people performance system. This translates to helping organizations set strategy, carry that strategy through every level of the organization and ensure that their people have the right skills, knowledge, tools, processes and technology to enable transformation and achieve business results. Solutions include strategy, leadership, employee engagement and culture consulting, enterprise technology implementation and adoption solutions, and organization design and business performance consulting.

• | Digital Learning Solutions. As organizations become increasingly global and matrixed, single-source training solutions and learning interventions don't always fit every audience and business need. Learning and Development (L&D) teams must consider blended solutions that include a range of modalities and methodologies. In an increasingly digital world with evolving online learning and social platforms, bots, artificial intelligence and more, we have expertise to help organizations vet and select the right platforms to purchase, understand the best way to implement them and help teams adapt learning strategies and approaches to business problems and training requests in order to remain relevant and respond to disruption. 


• | Learning & Training Outsourcing. We offer a wide range of managed learning services, including design, delivery and global management of comprehensive learning programs for national and multinational businesses and government organizations. We can deliver our services individually or as a complete, integrated training solution. Solutions include the management of our customers’ training departments, as well as administrative processes, such as vendor management, call center/help desk administration and learning management system (LMS) administration. Our services encompass a wide spectrum of learning engagements ranging from focusing on a single aspect of a learning process to multi-year contracts where we manage the learning infrastructure of our customer.


• | Documentation Development. Training-related documentation products include custom instructor and student training manuals, job aids to support technical skills development and instructional materials suitable for web-based and blended learning solutions.

Competitive Strengths

We believe our key competitive strengths include:

Global Delivery and Single-Source Custom Training Solutions Provider. We believe we are one of the largest independent single-source custom training solutions providers with the capability of delivering globally in the markets in which we compete. We provide managed learning services solutions spanning the full life-cycle of the training process, including the management of training departments and administrative processes for our customers. We believe that the breadth of our service and product offerings, which encompass fully integrated managed learning services solutions as well as discrete services, allows us to better serve the needs of our clients by providing them with a single-source solution for custom training, consulting and technical and engineering services. We believe that the integration of our services into a single platform, together with our global presence and delivery capabilities, allows our customers to leverage an enterprise-wide solution to address their performance improvement needs in a way that streamlines their internal operations, improves the speed and efficiency at which critical know-how is disseminated on a firm-wide basis, and enables them to achieve their desired performance improvement goals.

Outstanding Reputation in the Industry. We have continued to build an outstanding reputation in the learning and training industry through the delivery of our solutions and have received numerous awards. 2019 highlights include: 
Industry Awards

• | Training Industry, Inc., The Top Training Companies™ lists are developed based on extensive, proprietary research and analysis of companies around the world. They examine the capabilities, experience, and expertise of hundreds of learning organizations. In 2019, we appeared on the Top 20 lists in the following categories: Assessment & Evaluation, Content Development, Gamification, Health & Safety Training, IT Training, Leadership Training, Sales Training, and Training Outsourcing.


• | Brandon Hall HCM Excellence recognizes the best organizations that have successfully deployed programs and strategies that have achieved measurable results. We received ten Brandon Hall Excellence in Learning Awards and one for Excellence in Learning Technology.

Customer Supplier Awards - GP Strategies has been recognized by two strategic clients with a prestigious Supplier of the Year Award, including:

• | AVANGRID - Recognized as a Supplier of the Year for Health and Safety. This award is given to suppliers that have shown commitment and have provided value to AVANGRID's strategic plan.


• | General Motors - Recognizes GM’s best suppliers that have consistently exceeded GM’s expectation, creating outstanding value, or introducing innovations to the company. This is the third consecutive year GP Strategies has been recognized.

Legacy Technical Expertise. In the 1960’s, we began providing technical services to the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine program and the nuclear electric-power generation industry, and have since maintained and expanded our reputation for providing technically complex consulting, engineering, and training services. Many of our employees have engineering degrees, technical training or years of relevant technical industry experience. Through repeat projects with industry leaders we have acquired significant industry experience in providing highly technical consulting services. We believe that our technical expertise allows us to address market opportunities for complex business challenges that require in-depth expertise and certifications typically acquired over several years of specialized training and many years of experience. We also believe that our ability to provide both training-related and business consulting services allows us to gain insight into operations of our customers, understand the challenges they face and develop optimal solutions to meet these challenges. In addition, we believe that the knowledge that we develop while working with our clients provides us with a significant competitive advantage as those clients look to expand the scope of services outsourced to third party service providers.
Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Large Product Sales Training Market. We believe that the introduction of new products with advanced features, combined with the growing amount and accessibility of information available to consumers, requires companies to maintain a highly skilled and technologically current sales force to effectively capture customer interest and confidence. In-house implementation of product sales training programs can be expensive and time-consuming as these programs typically involve significant levels of face-to-face training, in some cases across a large global sales force. In addition, product sales training tends to be a continuous process, as the pace of new products and features in many cases requires year-round updating of the sales force. We believe we have one of the industry’s leading product sales training platforms, and are well positioned to benefit from increased training outsourcing as companies look for ways to reduce costs. 
Highly Qualified and Dedicated Employees and Tenured Management Team. Our most important asset is our people, as their wide-ranging skill sets enable us to serve our diverse and expanding global client base. As a result, we are committed to the continued development of our employees. We offer our employees technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees’ commitment to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork. We also benefit from the skill and experience of our executive management team, who together have in excess of 100 years of experience in the training industry and have an average tenure with our company of over 20 years.

Contracts

We currently perform under fixed price (including fixed-fee per transaction), time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable contracts. 
The following table illustrates the percentage of our total revenue attributable to each type of contract for the year ended December 31, 2019:

Fixed fee per transaction | 54 | %
Fixed price | 20 | 
Time-and-materials, including fixed rate | 23 | 
Cost-reimbursable | 3 | 
Total revenue | 100 | %


Fixed price contracts (including fixed-fee per transaction) provide for payment to us of pre-determined amounts as compensation for the delivery of specific products or services, without regard to the actual costs incurred. We bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs required to perform the specified services may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain a loss, but we have the opportunity to derive increased profit if the costs required to perform the specified services are less than expected. Fixed price contracts generally permit the client to terminate the contract on written notice; in the event of such termination we would typically be paid a proportionate amount of the fixed price.

Time-and-materials contracts generally provide for billing of services based upon the hourly billing rates of the employees performing the services and the actual expenses incurred multiplied by a specified mark-up factor up to a certain aggregate dollar amount. Our time-and-materials contracts include certain contracts under which we have agreed to provide training, engineering and technical services at fixed hourly rates. Time-and-materials contracts generally permit the client to control the amount, type and timing of the services to be performed by us and to terminate the contract on written notice. If a contract is terminated, we are typically paid for the services we have provided through the date of termination.
6

Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for us to be reimbursed for our actual direct and indirect costs plus a fee. These contracts also are generally subject to termination at the convenience of the client. If a contract is terminated, we are typically reimbursed for our costs through the date of termination, plus the cost of an orderly termination, and paid a proportionate amount of the fee.

International

We conduct our business globally and outside the United States primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries. We may continue to create new subsidiaries as our business expands. Through these subsidiaries, we are capable of providing substantially the same services and products as are available to clients in the United States, although modified as appropriate to address the language, business practices and cultural factors unique to each client and country. In combination with our subsidiaries, we are able to coordinate the delivery to multi-national clients of services and products that achieve consistency on a global, enterprise-wide basis.  Revenue from operations outside the United States represented approximately 36% and 33% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively (see Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).
Customers

During 2019, we provided services to over 500 customers. Significant customers include multinational automotive manufacturers, such as General Motors Company, Hyundai Motor Company, Ford Motor Company and Fiat Chrysler; financial services companies such as HSBC, Bank of America, SunTrust Banks and PNC Bank; governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Skills Funding Agency in the United Kingdom; U.S. Government prime contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, Bechtel National, Inc. and General Dynamics; commercial electric power utilities, such as Eskom, Entergy and National Grid; pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co. and Pfizer; and other large multinational companies, such as Microsoft, CIGNA Corporation, Rockwell Automation, Deere & Company, and Boeing. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we provided services to 148 customers in the Fortune 500 and 124 customers in the Global Fortune 500.
We have a market concentration of revenue in both the automotive sector and the financial & insurance sector. Revenue from the automotive industry accounted for approximately 28%, 23% and 22% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single automotive customer, which accounted for approximately 13%, 14% and 13% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 accounts receivable from a single automotive customer totaled $17.2 million, or 13% of our consolidated accounts receivable balance. Revenue from the financial & insurance industry accounted for approximately 16%, 19% and 20% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single financial services customer, which accounted for approximately 10%, 13% and 14% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, billed and unbilled accounts receivable from a single financial services customer totaled $15.4 million, or 8%, of our consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2019 or consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2019.
We believe the nature of our business, which includes established relationships with our clients, provides us with a platform from which to drive revenues and gives us visibility into our future performance. We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, with over 80% of our top 25 clients having used our services for five or more years. Additionally, over 90% of our annual revenue is generated from client relationships that existed in the prior year. We also had a backlog for services under executed contracts of $349.8 million as of December 31, 2019. 
Employees

Our principal resource is our personnel. As of December 31, 2019, we had 4,856 employees. We also utilize additional adjunct instructors and consultants as needed. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to continue to attract, retain and integrate into our operations instructors, engineers, technical personnel and consultants who possess the skills and experience required to meet the needs of our clients.

We utilize a variety of methods to attract and retain personnel. We believe that the compensation and benefits offered to our employees are competitive with the compensation and benefits available from other organizations with which we compete for personnel. In addition, we encourage the professional development of our employees, both internally via GP University (our own 
7

internal training resource) and through third parties, and we also offer tuition reimbursement for job-related educational costs. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Competition

We face a highly competitive environment. The principal competitive factors are the experience and capability of service personnel, performance, quality and functionality of products, reputation and price. The training industry is large, highly fragmented and competitive, with low barriers to entry and no single competitor accounting for a significant market share. According to Training Industry, Inc., global external training expenditures totaled approximately $99.7 billion in 2019. Our competitors include several large publicly traded and privately held companies, vocational and technical training schools, degree-granting colleges and universities, continuing education programs and thousands of small privately held training providers and individuals. In addition, many of our clients maintain internal training departments, which have the resources and ability to provide the same or similar services in-house. Some of our competitors offer services and products at lower prices, and some competitors have significantly greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing and other resources. Moreover, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the training and performance improvement market due, in part, to the evolving nature of the market and the relatively low barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that we will be successful against such competition.

Engineering and consulting services such as those that we provide are performed by many of the customers themselves, large architectural and engineering firms that have expanded their range of services beyond design and construction activities, large consulting firms, information technology companies, major suppliers of equipment and individuals and independent service companies similar to us. The engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel.  Many of our competitors for our engineering and technical consulting services have greater financial resources than we do.  Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Sales & Marketing

In 2018, sales, marketing and proposal resources were centralized to better position ourselves to achieve the growth goals of the organization. We operate as an integrated, customer-centric team to ensure our go-to-customer strategy directly supports the business strategy.  We use our online digital presence, attendance at trade shows, presentations at industry and trade association conferences, press releases, industry award submissions, webinars and workshops given by our personnel to serve important marketing functions. We also carry out selective print and digital advertising and conduct targeted marketing campaigns to current and prospective clients. In addition, we use our social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SlideShare and a Company blog on our website, as a means of sharing thought leadership content, disclosing information about the Company, our services and other topics important to our clients.  By staying ahead of the market trends and engaging with clients, we are able to identify possible opportunities to expand the services we are providing them as well as extend the current services we are providing. In other cases, clients ask us to bid competitively. In both cases, we submit proposals to the client for evaluation. The period between submission of a proposal to final award can range from 30 days or less (generally for noncompetitive, short-term contracts), to a year or more (generally for large, competitive multi-year contracts).
Backlog

Our backlog for services under executed contracts and subcontracts was approximately $349.8 million and $318.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We anticipate that approximately 85 percent of our backlog as of December 31, 2019 will be recognized as revenue during 2020. However, the rate at which services are performed under certain contracts, and thus the rate at which backlog will be recognized, may be at the discretion of the client and most contracts are, as mentioned above, subject to termination by the client upon written notice.
