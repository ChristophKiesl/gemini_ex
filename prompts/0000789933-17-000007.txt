A. North American Coal
General
NACoal mines coal primarily for use in power generation and provides value-added services for natural resource companies. Coal is surface mined from NACoal's mines in North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and as of January 2017, on the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. NACoal provides value-added services such as maintaining and operating draglines for independently owned limerock quarries through its North American Mining ("NAM") division and providing ash hauling services for power plants and other facilities.
NACoal has the following operating coal mining subsidiaries: Bisti, Caddo Creek Resources Company, LLC (“Caddo Creek”), Camino Real Fuels, LLC (“Camino Real”), The Coteau Properties Company (“Coteau”), Coyote Creek Mining Company, LLC (“Coyote Creek”), Demery Resources Company, LLC (“Demery”), The Falkirk Mining Company (“Falkirk”), Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (“Liberty”), Mississippi Lignite Mining Company (“MLMC”) and The Sabine Mining Company (“Sabine”). 
Coteau, Coyote, Falkirk, Liberty, MLMC and Sabine supply lignite coal for power generation. Bisti and Camino Real supply sub-bituminous coal for power generation. Caddo Creek and Demery supply lignite coal for the production of activated carbon. Each of these mines are mine-mouth operations that deliver their coal production to adjacent or nearby power plants, synfuels plants or activated carbon processing facilities under long-term supply contracts. 
All of the operating coal mining subsidiaries other than MLMC are unconsolidated. The unconsolidated coal mining subsidiaries were formed to develop, construct and/or operate surface coal mines under long-term contracts and are capitalized primarily with debt financing provided by or supported by their respective customers, and without recourse to NACCO and NACoal. The contracts with the customers of the unconsolidated subsidiaries provide for reimbursement to the company at a price based on actual costs plus an agreed pre-tax profit per ton of coal sold or actual costs plus an agreed upon fee per btu of heating value delivered. The fees earned at each mine adjust over time in line with various indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates.  
MLMC is a consolidated entity because NACoal pays all operating costs and provides the capital for the mine. MLMC sells coal to its customer at a contractually agreed upon price which adjusts monthly, primarily based on changes in the level of established indices which reflect general U.S. inflation rates.  MLMC's customer, KMRC RH, LLC until April 30, 2016 and Choctaw Generation Limited Partnership, LLLP subsequent to April 30, 2016, accounted for approximately 69%, 57% and 39% of NACoal's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Centennial, which ceased coal production in the fourth quarter of 2015, is also a consolidated entity.
NAM provides value-added services for independently owned limerock quarries and is reimbursed by its customers based on actual costs plus a management fee. The financial results for NAM are included in the consolidated mining operations or unconsolidated mining operations based on each entity's structure. NAM's largest customer, Cemex Construction Materials of Florida, LLC ("Cemex"), accounted for approximately 16% of NACoal's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
NACoal also provides coal handling, processing and drying services for a number of customers. For example, NoDak Energy Services, LLC ("NoDak") operates and maintains a coal processing facility for a customer's power plant. North American Coal Royalty Company provides surface and mineral acquisition and lease maintenance services related to the Company's operations.
NACoal's total coal reserves approximate 1.9 billion tons (including the unconsolidated coal mining subsidiaries), with approximately 1.0 billion tons committed to customers pursuant to long-term contracts. At December 31, 2016, NACoal's operating mines consisted both of mines where the reserves were acquired (whether in fee or through leases) and developed by NACoal, as well as mines where reserves are owned or leased by the customers of the mines and developed by NACoal.

Sales, Marketing and Operations
The principal coal customers of NACoal are electric utilities, an independent power provider, producers of activated carbon and a synfuels plant. The total coal severed by mine (in millions of tons) for the three years ended December 31 and the weighted average prices per ton delivered for the three years ended December 31 are as follows:

Total tons severed | 32.3 | | | 30.5 | | | 31.6
Price per ton delivered | $ | 22.14 | | | $ | 23.63 | | $ | 23.75

The contracts under which certain of the unconsolidated subsidiaries operate provide that, under certain conditions, including default, the customer(s) involved may elect or be obligated to acquire the assets (subject to the liabilities) or the capital stock of the NACoal mining subsidiary for an amount effectively equal to book value. NACoal does not know of any conditions of default that currently exist. 
Seasonality
NACoal has experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonality; however, variations in coal demand can occur as a result of the timing of planned or unplanned outage days at NACoal's customers' facilities. Variations in coal demand can also occur as a result of changes in demand for electricity, which can fluctuate based on changes in weather patterns.

MLMC holds subleases under which it has the right to mine approximately 308 acres of coal interests. The majority of the leases held by MLMC were originally acquired during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s with terms extending 50 years, many of which can be further extended by the continuation of mining operations.
The lignite deposits of the Gulf Coast are found primarily in a narrow band of strata that outcrops/subcrops along the margin of the Mississippi Embayment. The potentially exploitable tertiary lignites in Mississippi are found in the Wilcox Group. The outcropping Wilcox is composed predominately of non-marine sediments deposited on a broad flat plain.
Centennial Natural Resources 
Centennial ceased active mining operations at the end of 2015. Centennial's mines are located about 12 miles east and southeast of the city of Jasper in Walker County, Alabama, about 20 miles southeast of the city of Jasper in Jefferson County, Alabama, and about 15 miles northwest of the City of Jasper in Winston County, Alabama. The main entrances to the Walker County, Alabama mines are accessed by means of a half-mile graveled road extending south off Sipsey Road and a half-mile graveled road extending west off Cordova Gorgas Road. The main entrance to the Jefferson County, Alabama mine is accessed by means of a three-mile paved section of Porter Road extending south off Snowville - Brent Road. The main entrance to the Winston County, Alabama mine is accessed by means of a quarter-mile gravel road extending west off County Road 21. The reserves within the Centennial mines are controlled by Centennial. 
Centennial and its affiliate, North American Coal Royalty Company, own in fee approximately 5,602 acres of coal interests and approximately 2,523 acres of surface interests in Alabama. Centennial holds leases in Alabama granting the right to mine approximately 14,932 acres of coal interests and the right to utilize approximately 18,783 acres of surface interests. The majority of the leases held by Centennial were originally acquired between 2000 and 2012 with terms that can be extended by the continuation of mining and reclamation.
Structurally, the reserves for the Centennial mines are located within the Black Warrior Coal Basin. The strata that underlies and outcrops in this region is of the Pottsville Formation of the Pennsylvanian Age. The Black Warrior Basin is the southernmost of a series of Pennsylvanian basins of the Appalachian Plateau. The Pottsville Formation in this area consists of thin to thick bedded sandstones, siltstones, shales, clays and coal seams. This sequence of clastic sediments is representative of a deltaic depositional environment. Structurally, the Black Warrior Basin is formed by a large gentle syncline that extends from north-central Mississippi in the west to north-central Alabama in the east. The syncline is tilted southwestward with a regional dip of 30 to 200 feet per mile. Toward the interior of the Black Warrior Basin, the regional southwest dip of Pottsville strata is modified by a series of three synclines and two anticlines. Of these, the major structural areas are the Warrior and Coalburg synclines, and the Sequatchie anticline. The fold axes are parallel to the Appalachian system in a northeast-southwest direction and plunge to the southwest with the regional dip.

NAM has no title, claim, lease or option to acquire any of the reserves at any of the limerock quarries where it provides mining services.
North American Coal Royalty Company
No operating mines currently exist on the undeveloped reserves in Alabama, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio and Texas. North American Coal Royalty Company receives certain royalty payments from third parties for production or advance royalty payments for oil and gas, as well as for coal reserves located in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.
General Information about the Mines
Leases. The leases held by Coteau, Coyote Creek, Falkirk and MLMC have a variety of continuation provisions, but generally permit the leases to be continued beyond their fixed terms. Centennial holds the mining rights to the reserves within its mines through fee ownership, and leases and licenses from the coal and surface owners. NACoal expects coal will be available to meet customers' future production requirements utilizing land and reserves that are currently owned or leased or accessible through ownership acquisition or new leases.
Previous Operators. There were no previous operators of the Freedom Mine, Falkirk Mine, South Hallsville No. 1 Mine, Five Forks Mine, Marshall Mine, Eagle Pass Mine, Liberty Mine, Coyote Creek Mine or Red Hills Mine. In January 2017, Bisti became the operator of NTEC's Navajo Mine, which was previously operated by a third party. 
 10

Exploration and Development. All mines are well past the exploration stage. With the exception of Centennial, which ceased production as of December 31, 2015, additional pit development is under way at each mine. Drilling programs are routinely conducted for the purpose of refining guidance related to ongoing operations. For example, at the Red Hills Mine, the lignite coal reserve has been defined by a drilling program that is designed to provide 500-foot spaced drill holes for areas anticipated to be mined within six years of the current pit. Drilling beyond the six-year horizon ranges from 1,000 to 2,000-foot centers. Drilling is conducted annually to stay current with the advance of mining operations. Geological evaluation is in process at all operating locations.
Facilities and Equipment. The facilities and equipment for each of the mines are maintained to allow for safe and efficient operation. The equipment is well maintained, in good physical condition and is either updated or replaced periodically with newer models or upgrades available to keep up with modern technology. As equipment wears out, the mines evaluate what
replacement option will be the most cost-efficient, including the evaluation of both new and used equipment, and proceed with that replacement. The majority of electrical power for the draglines, shovels, coal crushers, coal conveyors and facilities generally is provided by the power generation customer for the applicable mine. Electrical power for the Sabine facilities is provided by Upshur Rural Electric Co-op. Electrical power for the Sabine draglines is provided by the Pirkey Power Plant. The remainder of the equipment generally is powered by diesel fuel or gasoline. 
The total cost of the property, plant and equipment, net of applicable accumulated amortization, depreciation and impairment as of December 31, 2016 is set forth in the chart below:

Mine | Total Historical Cost of Mine Property, Plant and Equipment(excluding Coal Land, Real Estateand Construction in Progress), Net ofApplicable AccumulatedAmortization, Depreciation and Impairment

Predominantly all of Bisti, Caddo Creek, Camino Real, Demery and Liberty's machinery and equipment is owned by NACoal’s customers. A substantial portion of MLMC’s machinery, trucks and equipment is rented under operating leases and a dragline currently in Alabama is under a capital lease. All other draglines were purchased used and have been or are expected to be updated with much of the latest technology.

Government Regulation
NACoal’s coal mining operations and dragline mining services are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations on matters such as employee health and safety, and certain environmental laws relating to, among others, the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining operations, air pollution, water pollution, the disposal of wastes and effects on groundwater. In addition, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities that could affect demand for coal from NACoal’s coal mining operations.
Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for coal mining operations. NACoal or one of its subsidiaries holds or will hold the necessary permits at all of NACoal’s coal mining operations except Demery, Caddo Creek, Bisti and Camino Real, where NACoal’s customers hold the permits, and Centennial, where a coal reserve owner and a contract miner hold certain permits. The Company believes, based upon present information provided to it by these third-party mine permit holders, that these third parties have all permits necessary for NACoal to operate Centennial, Caddo Creek, Demery, Bisti and Camino Real; however, the Company cannot be certain that these third parties will be able to maintain all such permits in the future.
At the coal mining operations where NACoal holds the permits, NACoal is required to prepare and present to federal, state or local governmental authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment and public and employee health and safety.
The limerock quarries where NACoal provides dragline mining services are owned and operated by NACoal’s customers. 
Some laws, as discussed below, place many requirements on NACoal’s coal mining operations and the limerock quarries where NACoal provides dragline mining services. Federal and state regulations require regular monitoring of NACoal’s operations to ensure compliance.
Mine Health and Safety Laws
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 imposes safety and health standards on all coal mining operations. Regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations.
Environmental Laws
NACoal’s coal mining operations are subject to various federal environmental laws, as amended, including:

• | the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”);


• | the Clean Air Act, including amendments to that act in 1990 (“CAA”);


• | the Clean Water Act of 1972 (the “Clean Water Act”);


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and


• | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.

In addition to these federal environmental laws, various states have enacted environmental laws that provide for higher levels of environmental compliance than similar federal laws. These state environmental laws require reporting, permitting and/or approval of many aspects of coal mining operations. Both federal and state inspectors regularly visit mines to enforce compliance. NACoal has ongoing training, compliance and permitting programs to ensure compliance with such environmental laws.
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
SMCRA establishes mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of surface coal mining operations. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority. All of the states where NACoal has active coal mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization under SMCRA.
Coal mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for coal mining operations from the applicable regulatory agency. These SMCRA permit provisions include requirements for coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil removal, storage and replacement, selective handling of overburden materials, mine pit backfilling and grading, protection of the hydrologic balance, surface drainage control, mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment, and revegetation.
 12

Although NACoal’s permits have stated expiration dates, SMCRA provides for a right of successive renewal. The cost of obtaining surface mining permits can vary widely depending on the quantity and type of information that must be provided to obtain the permits; however, the cost of obtaining a permit is usually between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000, and the cost of obtaining a permit renewal is usually between $15,000 and $100,000.
The Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a fee on certain coal mining operations. The proceeds are used principally to reclaim mine lands closed prior to 1977. In addition, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund also makes transfers annually to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund (the “Fund”), which provides health care benefits to retired coal miners who are beneficiaries of the Fund. The fee is currently $0.08 per ton on lignite coal produced and $0.28 per ton on other surface-mined coal.
SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for surface coal mines. The Company accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharges, where necessary. These obligations are unfunded with the exception of the final mine closure costs for the Coyote Creek Mine, which will be funded throughout the production stage.
SMCRA stipulates compliance with many other major environmental programs, including the CAA and Clean Water Act. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regulates activities affecting navigable waters, and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulates the use of explosives for blasting. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ("OSM") are engaged in a series of rulemakings and other administrative actions under the Clean Water Act and other statutes that are directed at reducing the impact of coal mining operations on water bodies. Currently, these initiatives are primarily with respect to mining operations in the Appalachian region, especially on mountaintops. 
The Company does not believe there is any significant risk to NACoal’s ability to maintain its existing mining permits or its ability to acquire future mining permits for its mines.
Clean Air Act and Clean Power Plan ("CPP")
The process of burning coal can cause many compounds and impurities in the coal to be released into the air, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulates and other matter. The CAA and the corresponding state laws that extensively regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining operations occur through CAA permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to air contaminants, especially particulate matter. Indirect impacts on coal mining operations occur through regulation of the air emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, particulate matter and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. The EPA has promulgated or proposed regulations that impose tighter emission restrictions in a number of areas, some of which are currently subject to litigation. The general effect of tighter restrictions could be to reduce demand for coal. Any reduction in coal’s share of the capacity for power generation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
States are required to submit to the EPA revisions to their state implementation plans ("SIPs") that demonstrate the manner in which the states will attain national ambient air quality standards ("NAAQS") every time a NAAQS is issued or revised by the EPA. The EPA has adopted NAAQS for several pollutants, which continue to be reviewed periodically for revisions. When the EPA adopts new, more stringent NAAQS for a pollutant, some states have to change their existing SIPs. If a state fails to revise its SIP and obtain EPA approval, the EPA may adopt regulations to effect the revision. Coal mining operations and coal-fired power plants that emit particulate matter or other specified material are, therefore, affected by changes in the SIPs. Through this process over the last few years, the EPA has reduced the NAAQS for particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. NACoal’s coal mining operations and power generation customers may be directly affected when the revisions to the SIPs are made and incorporate new NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and particulate matter. In response to a court remand of earlier rules to control the regional dispersion of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from coal-fired power plants and their impacts of downwind NAAQS areas, in mid-2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") to address interstate transport of pollutants. This affects states in the eastern half of the U.S. and Texas. This rule imposes additional emission restrictions on coal-fired power plants to attain ozone and fine particulate NAAQS. On August 21, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down the CSAPR rule, effectively eliminating the new additional emission restrictions. The EPA subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned the lower court ruling on April 29, 2014. The EPA began implementation of the rule January 1, 2015, when Phase I emission reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide became effective. Phase II reductions became effective on January 1, 2017. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR, which included additional reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions. Some questions regarding the rule remain unresolved and additional litigation is pending.
 13

The CAA Acid Rain Control Provisions were promulgated as part of the CAA Amendments of 1990 in Title IV of the CAA (“Acid Rain Program”). The Acid Rain Program required reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Acid Rain Program is now a mature program, and the Company believes that any market impacts of the required controls have likely been factored into the coal market.
The EPA promulgated a regional haze program designed to protect and to improve visibility at and around Class I Areas, which are generally National Parks, National Wilderness Areas and International Parks. This program may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants, the operation of which may impair visibility at and around the Class I Areas. Additionally, the program requires certain existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. States were required to submit Regional Haze SIPs to the EPA by December 2007; however, many states did not meet that deadline. The EPA and the States are currently in litigation to resolve questions regarding the stringency and timing of SIPs. 
Under the CAA, new and modified sources of air pollution must meet certain new source standards (the “New Source Review Program”). In the late 1990s, the EPA filed lawsuits against owners of many coal-fired power plants in the eastern U.S. alleging that the owners performed non-routine maintenance, causing increased emissions that should have triggered the application of these new source standards. Some of these lawsuits have been settled with the owners agreeing to install additional emission control devices in their coal-fired power plants. The remaining litigation and the uncertainty around the New Source Review Program rules could adversely impact demand for coal. Regardless of the outcome of litigation on either rule, stricter controls on emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury are likely. Any such controls may have an adverse impact on the demand for coal, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
Under the CAA, the EPA also adopts national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. In December 2011, the EPA adopted a final rule called the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (“MATS”), which applies to new and existing coal-fired and oil-fired units. This rule requires mercury emission reductions in fine particulates, which are being regulated as a surrogate for certain metals. In Michigan vs. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed MATS, and that ruling was appealed. On June 29, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the rule back to the Circuit Court, directing it to address deficiencies in the EPA’s MATS cost-benefit analysis. The Circuit Court directed the EPA to re-evaluate costs and benefits associated with the rule. On April 25, 2016, the EPA published a final supplemental finding that consideration of costs does not alter the agency's original conclusion to regulate mercury and other air toxics through this rule. 
NACoal’s power generation customers must incur substantial costs to control emissions to meet all of the CAA requirements, including the requirements under MATS and the EPA's regional haze program. These costs could raise the price of coal-generated electricity, making coal-fired power less competitive with other sources of electricity, thereby reducing demand for coal. In addition, NACoal's power generation customers may choose to close coal-fired generation units or to postpone or cancel plans to add new capacity, in light of these costs and the limited time available for compliance with the requirements and the prospects of the imposition of additional future requirements on emissions from coal-fired units. If NACoal's customers cannot offset the cost to control certain regulated pollutant emissions by lowering the costs of delivery of its coal on an energy equivalent basis or if NACoal's customers elect to close coal-fired units, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention and a considerable amount of legislative and regulatory attention in the United States. The U.S. Congress has considered climate change legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, particularly from coal combustion by power plants. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding GHG emissions by the U.S. or some of its states, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, such as opposition by environmental groups to expansion or modification of coal-fired power plants, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources.
The U.S. Congress continues to consider a variety of proposals to reduce GHG emissions from the combustion of coal and other fuels. These proposals include emission taxes, emission reductions, including “cap-and-trade” programs, and mandates or incentives to generate electricity by using renewable resources, such as wind or solar power. Some states have established programs to reduce GHG emissions. Further, governmental agencies have been providing grants or other financial incentives to entities developing or selling alternative energy sources with lower levels of GHG emissions, which may lead to more competition from those entities.
The EPA has begun to establish a GHG regulation program under the CAA by issuing a finding that the emission of six GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. On June 26, 2012, 
 14

the U.S. Court of Appeals - DC Circuit upheld this finding. Based on this finding, in 2012 the EPA published a New Source Performance Standard for greenhouse gases, emitted from future new power plants. This was withdrawn and subsequently reissued in January 2014. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed new regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. On June 18, 2014, the EPA also issued a proposed carbon dioxide emission regulation for reconstructed and modified power plants, which addresses carbon dioxide emissions limits for power plants subsequent to modification. On August 3, 2015, President Obama and the EPA announced the CPP, which includes final emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units ("EGUs") as well as limits on GHG emission rates for new, modified and reconstructed EGUs. Under the CPP, nationwide carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 32% from 2005 levels by 2030 with emissions reductions scheduled to be phased in between 2022 and 2030. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the CPP pending resolution of litigation challenging the CPP. This includes a stay on EPA requirements that states submit SIPs describing plans for restricting carbon dioxide emissions in each state. Litigation is currently ongoing. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding GHG emissions by the U.S. or some of its states or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, such as opposition by environmental groups to expansion or modification of coal-fired power plants, could result in electric generators reducing generation or closing coal-fired power plants and/or switching from coal to other fuel sources and could have a materially adverse effect on NACoal’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The U.S. has not implemented the 1992 Framework Convention on Global Climate Change (“Kyoto Protocol”), which became effective for many countries on February 16, 2005. The Kyoto Protocol was intended to limit or reduce emissions of GHGs. The U.S. has not ratified the emission targets of the Kyoto Protocol or any other GHG agreement. Because the first Protocol commitment period ended in 2012, an amendment to extend the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Doha, Qatar on December 8, 2012. The U.S. is not a signatory to the amendment. Even though the U.S. has not accepted these international GHG limiting treaties or enacted domestic legislation to control GHGs, numerous lawsuits and regulatory actions have been undertaken by states and environmental groups to try to force controls on the emission of carbon dioxide; or to prevent the construction of new coal-fired power plants. On November 11, 2014, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping jointly announced each nation's intentions to limit GHG emissions. These were non-binding statements of intent. As a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, on December 12, 2015, international negotiators finalized the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“Paris Agreement”). Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement has no binding GHG reduction mandates on signatories. Participating countries only submit a description of their intended GHG reductions, and provide periodic progress updates, with no penalties for not meeting their self-imposed targets. The Paris Agreement also includes language stating that developed countries will provide financial assistance to help developing countries meet their GHG targets and adapt to climate change, but there are no mandated contributions. Because this agreement has no legally binding GHG reduction requirements, President Obama believed it did not constitute a treaty requiring Senate ratification. He signed this as a sole executive agreement on September 3, 2016. The implementation of the Paris Agreement, or other international agreements, the regulations promulgated to date by the EPA with respect to GHG emissions or the adoption of new legislation or regulations to control GHG emissions, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Significant public opposition has also been raised with respect to the proposed construction of certain new coal-fueled EGUs due to the potential for increased air emissions. Such opposition, as well as any corporate or investor policies against coal-fired EGUs, could also reduce the demand for NACoal’s coal. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled EGUs could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential impact on NACoal of future laws, regulations or other policies or circumstances will depend upon the degree to which any such laws, regulations or other policies or circumstances force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to predict reasonably the impact that any such laws, regulations or other policies may have on NACoal’s business, financial condition and results of operations. However, such impacts could have a material adverse effect on NACoal’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company believes NACoal has obtained all necessary permits under the CAA at all of its coal mining operations where it is responsible for permitting and is in compliance with such permits.
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act affects coal mining operations by establishing in-stream water quality standards and treatment standards for waste water discharge. Permits requiring regular monitoring, reporting and performance standards govern the discharge of pollutants into water.
 15

Federal and state regulations establish standards that prohibit the diminution of water quality. Waters discharged from coal mines are required to meet these standards. These federal and state requirements could require more costly water treatment and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company believes NACoal has obtained all permits required under the Clean Water Act and corresponding state laws and is in compliance with such permits. In many instances, mining operations require securing Clean Water Act authorization or a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for operations in waters of the United States. 
Bellaire Corporation, a wholly owned non-operating subsidiary of the Company (“Bellaire”), is treating mine water drainage from coal refuse piles associated with two former underground coal mines in Ohio and one former underground coal mine in Pennsylvania, and is treating mine water from a former underground coal mine in Pennsylvania. Bellaire anticipates that it will need to continue these activities indefinitely and has accrued a liability of $16.2 million as of December 31, 2016 related to these treatment operations.
In connection with Bellaire's normal permit renewal with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ("DEP"), Bellaire was notified during 2004 that in order to obtain renewal of the permit Bellaire would be required to establish a mine water treatment trust (the "Trust"). On October 1, 2010, Bellaire executed a Post-Mining Treatment Trust Consent Order and Agreement with the DEP which established the Trust to provide a financial assurance mechanism to assure the long-term treatment of post-mining discharges. Bellaire funded the Trust with $5.0 million. See Note 7 and Note 10 for further information on the Trust.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") affects coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, including hazardous wastes. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, currently are exempted from hazardous waste management. In December 2014, the EPA finalized a rule specifying management standards for coal combustion residuals or coal ash ("CCRs") as a non-hazardous waste. These standards may raise the cost for CCR disposal at coal-fired power plants, making them less competitive, and may have an adverse impact on demand for coal. 
The EPA rule exempts CCRs disposed of at mine sites and reserves any regulation thereof to the OSM. Currently, the OSM is developing rules to address the use of CCRs on coal mine sites. The outcome of these rulemakings, and any subsequent actions by EPA and OSM, could impact those NACoal operations that beneficially use CCRs. If NACoal were unable to beneficially use CCRs, its revenues for disposing of CCRs from its customers may decrease and its costs may increase due to the purchase of alternative materials for beneficial uses. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources. The Company must also comply with reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act.
From time to time, the Company has been the subject of administrative proceedings, litigation and investigations relating to environmental matters.
The extent of the liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws cannot be predicted with certainty due to many factors, including the lack of specific information available with respect to many sites, the potential for new or changed laws and regulations, the development of new remediation technologies and the uncertainty regarding the timing of work with respect to particular sites. As a result, the Company may incur material liabilities or costs related to environmental matters in the future, and such environmental liabilities or costs could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that changes in laws or regulations would not affect the manner in which NACoal is required to conduct its operations.
 16

Competition
The coal industry competes with other sources of energy, particularly oil, gas, hydro-electric power and nuclear power. In addition, it competes with subsidized green sources of energy, such as biofuels, wind and solar. Among the factors that affect competition are the price and availability of oil and natural gas, environmental and related political considerations, the time and expenditures required to develop new energy sources, the cost of transportation, the cost of compliance with governmental regulations and the impact of federal and state energy policies. The ability of NACoal to market and develop its reserves will depend upon the interaction of these factors.
Based on industry information, NACoal believes it was one of the ten largest coal producers in the U.S. in 2016 based on total coal tons produced.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, NACoal had approximately 2,000 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees at the unconsolidated mines. None of NACoal’s employees were unionized as of December 31, 2016. NACoal believes its current labor relations with employees are satisfactory.

HBB is a leading designer, marketer and distributor of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, as well as commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. HBB’s products are marketed primarily to retail merchants and wholesale distributors. 
Sales and Marketing
HBB designs, markets and distributes a wide range of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, including, but not limited to, blenders, can openers, coffeemakers, food processors, indoor electric grills, irons, mixers, slow cookers, toasters and toaster ovens. In addition, HBB designs, markets and distributes commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. HBB generally markets its “better” and “best” products under the Hamilton Beach® brand and uses the Proctor Silex® brand for the “good” and opening price point products. HBB successfully entered the "only-the-best" market with a licensing agreement to sell a line of counter top appliances and kitchen tools under the Wolf Gourmet® brand as well as the introduction of the Hamilton Beach® Professional brand. As a result of the 2014 Weston Brands acquisition, HBB now markets a range of game and garden food processing equipment including, but not limited to, meat grinders, bag sealers, dehydrators and meat slicers under the Weston® brand as well as several private label brands. HBB supplies additional private label products on a limited basis throughout North America. HBB continues to pursue other opportunities to create or add product lines and new brands that can be distributed in high-end or specialty stores and on the Internet.
HBB markets its retail products primarily in North America, but also sells products in South America, Asia and other selected markets. HBB commercial products are sold worldwide. Retail sales in North America are generated predominantly by a network of inside sales employees to mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers, distributors and other retail outlets. Wal-Mart accounted for approximately 32%, 32% and 33% of HBB’s revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Amazon accounted for approximately 10% of HBB's revenues in 2016. HBB’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 54%, 52% and 56% of HBB’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss of or significant reduction in sales to any key customer could result in significant decreases in HBB’s revenues and profitability and its ability to sustain or grow its business.
Sales promotion activities are primarily focused on cooperative advertising. In addition, HBB promotes certain of its innovative products through the use of television, internet and print advertising. HBB also licenses certain of its trademarks to various licensees primarily for use with microwaves, compact refrigerators, cookware, kitchen tools and gadgets and full-size household vacuums.
Because of the seasonal nature of the markets for small electric appliances, HBB’s management believes backlog is not a meaningful indicator of performance and is not a significant indicator of annual sales. Backlog represents customer orders, which may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment. Backlog for HBB was approximately $14.1 million and $16.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
HBB’s warranty program to the consumer consists generally of a limited warranty lasting for varying periods of up to ten years for electric appliances, with the majority of products having a warranty of one year. Under its warranty program, HBB may repair or replace, at its option, those products returned under warranty.

The market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. Revenues and operating profit for HBB are traditionally greater in the second half of the year as sales of small electric appliances to retailers and consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Because of the seasonality of purchases of its products, HBB generally uses a substantial amount of cash or short-term debt to finance inventories and accounts receivable in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
HBB holds patents and trademarks registered in the U.S. and foreign countries for various products. HBB believes its business is not dependent upon any individual patent, copyright or license, but that the Hamilton Beach®, Proctor Silex® and Weston® trademarks are material to its business.
Product Design and Development
HBB spent $9.7 million, $9.6 million and $9.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on product design and development activities.
Key Suppliers and Raw Material
HBB’s products are supplied to its specifications by third-party suppliers located primarily in China. HBB does not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operates mainly on a purchase order basis. HBB generally negotiates purchase orders with its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies could result in certain non-U.S. manufacturers increasing the U.S. dollar prices for future product purchases.
During 2016, HBB purchased 98% of its finished products from suppliers in China. HBB purchases its inventory from approximately 45 suppliers, two of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2016. HBB believes the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet HBB’s production and quality requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect HBB’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
The principal raw materials used by HBB’s third-party suppliers to manufacture its products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. HBB believes adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
Competition
The small electric household appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many small manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Based on publicly available information about the industry, HBB believes it is one of the largest full-line distributors and marketers of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances in North America based on key product categories.
Besides North America, HBB also competes to a lesser degree in Europe through its commercial product lines, and in South America and China. The competition in these geographic markets is more fragmented than in North America, and HBB is not yet a significant participant in these markets.
As brick and mortar retailers generally purchase a limited selection of small electric appliances, HBB competes with other suppliers for retail shelf space. In the e-commerce channel, HBB must compete with a broad list of competitors. HBB conducts consumer advertising for the Hamilton Beach® brand and the Weston® brand. HBB believes the principal areas of competition with respect to its products are product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, supply chain excellence, merchandising, promotion and warranty.
Government Regulation
HBB is subject to numerous federal and state health, safety and environmental regulations. HBB’s management believes the impact of expenditures to comply with such laws will not have a material adverse effect on HBB.
As a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to seek to exclude products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous from the market. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of HBB’s products, or HBB may voluntarily do so.
Throughout the world, electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards, including requirements in some jurisdictions that products be listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) or other similar recognized laboratories. HBB also uses Intertek Testing Services for certification and testing of compliance with UL standards, as well as other nation- 
 18

and industry-specific standards. HBB endeavors to have its products designed to meet the certification requirements of, and to be certified in, each of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Section 1502 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires public companies to disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as "conflict minerals," are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by those companies and if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country. The ongoing implementation of these disclosure requirements by HBB could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components used in HBB's products. In addition, the supply-chain due diligence investigation required by the conflict minerals rules requires expenditures of resources and management attention, regardless of the results of the investigation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, HBB’s work force consisted of approximately 600 employees, none of whom are represented by unions except 16 hourly employees at HBB’s Picton, Ontario distribution facility. These employees are represented by an employee association which performs a consultative role on employment matters. None of HBB’s U.S. employees are unionized. HBB believes its current labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
C. Kitchen Collection
General
KC is a national specialty retailer of kitchenware in outlet and traditional malls throughout the United States.  
Sales and Marketing
KC operated 223 retail stores as of December 31, 2016 under the Kitchen Collection® store name in outlet and traditional malls throughout the United States. The stores sell kitchenware from a number of highly recognizable name-brands, including Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex®.
Seasonality
Revenues and operating profit for KC are traditionally greater in the second half of the year as sales to consumers increase significantly with the fall holiday-selling season. Because of the seasonality of purchases of its products, KC incurs substantial short-term debt to finance inventories in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Product Design and Development
KC, a retailer, has limited expenditures for product design and development activities.
Product Sourcing and Distribution
KC purchases all inventory centrally, which allows it to take advantage of volume purchase discounts and monitor controls over inventory and product mix. KC purchases its inventory from approximately 218 suppliers, one of which represented approximately 23% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2016. No other supplier represents more than 10% of purchases. KC believes that the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet KC’s requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect KC’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
KC currently maintains its inventory for distribution to its stores at a distribution center located near its corporate headquarters in Chillicothe, Ohio. 
Competition
KC competes against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores and internet and catalog retailers. The retail environment continues to be extremely competitive. Widespread Chinese sourcing of products allows many retailers to offer value-priced kitchen products. While a number of very low-end and very high-end kitchenware retailers participate in the marketplace, KC believes there is still an opportunity for stores offering mid-priced, high-quality kitchenware.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
KC holds a trademark registered in the U.S. for the Kitchen Collection® store name and believes that the trademark is material to its business.
