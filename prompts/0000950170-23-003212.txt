 Item 1. Business
Overview
 Momentive Global Inc. (the “Company”) is a leader in agile experience management, providing Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions that help businesses collect and analyze stakeholder sentiment at scale. We believe the business insights our solutions deliver enable more than 330,000 organizations worldwide to build market leadership, delight their customers, and engage their employees. Our solutions are powered by a platform that combines audience panels, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics capabilities that help make our products easy-to-use yet powerful to deliver speed-to-insights for our customers.
 We have transformed from a provider of digital survey tools sold through the Internet to an enterprise SaaS company that leverages both product-led and sales-led go-to-market motions. In 2022, approximately 38% of our total revenue was generated from customers who purchased software through our enterprise sales force, up from 32% in 2021. To help us engage more deeply with enterprise customers, we rebranded ourselves as “Momentive” in June 2021 and changed our legal name from “SVMK Inc.” to “Momentive Global Inc.” In February 2022, we announced plans to consolidate our product portfolio under the Momentive and SurveyMonkey brands and web surfaces. The Momentive brand represents our suite of upmarket solutions sold primarily through our sales force, while the SurveyMonkey brand represents our forms and survey products sold primarily through our website.
 Our Products
 Our products address three major business use cases:
 •Building Market Leadership: Used by customers in marketing, insights, product, and investment management roles, our products help businesses spot changing marketing trends, build and price products, optimize ad creatives, and build brand value;
 •Delighting Customers: Used by professionals in customer success, customer support, marketing, and product roles, our products deliver insights that help businesses engage and retain their customers. Specifically, our products help businesses manage programs that measure and optimize their customers’: net promoter score (“NPS”); customer satisfaction (“CSAT”); customer effort scores (“CES”); and experiences with a company’s website, mobile app, and events; and
 •Engaging Employees: Used by customers in human resource and employee management roles, our products help businesses understand and engage with their employees and build a better workplace, addressing areas such as employee engagement and retention, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”), candidate experience, return to work, and performance management.
 We offer three product categories, Surveys, Customer Experience, and Insights Solutions, which are summarized below. We believe our products are differentiated in the market due to their ease of use, speed to insight, price relative to alternatives, and ability to integrate with our customers’ third-party systems of record. Today, we offer certain tiers of our Surveys and Insights Solutions product categories on a self-serve basis through our website, and we offer a suite of enterprise-grade experience management solutions from all three product categories through a direct sales force. We generate revenue from these offerings either on a subscription or transactional basis, depending on the product. We believe that these three product categories, combined with our sales-led go-to-market motion, will enable us to continue to increase our penetration of enterprise customers.
 Surveys
 Our Core Survey Platform
 Our leading survey software products, branded under SurveyMonkey, enable our customers to collect, analyze, and act on stakeholder feedback across a broad number of business use cases. We have designed products that optimize the quality of feedback and maximize response rates to help our customers improve customer experiences, develop a diverse and high-performing workforce, and grow their business. We refer to our survey platform as our “core platform” as it powers our self-serve and sales-assisted Survey and Insights Solutions offerings. Key components of our core platform include the following:


•Templates: Our library of hundreds of customizable survey templates and certified questions, designed by a team of survey scientists, facilitates an easy-to-use and methodologically-sound survey creation process. This enables customers to collect high quality, actionable feedback, regardless of their research expertise;
 •Ease of Use: Our products are flexible and easy to use, which enables individuals and organizations of all sizes to collect and analyze stakeholder feedback. Our survey platform leverages SurveyMonkey Genius, our proprietary survey creation assistant, which uses insights extracted from our diverse data set to guide and optimize survey creation;
 •Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Our platform leverages artificial intelligence and proprietary machine learning models that increase survey and response quality and deliver actionable insights faster. SurveyMonkey Genius helps customers ask the right questions the right way, guiding customers through the survey creation process, predicting response rates and time to complete a survey, and offering suggestions to improve survey quality and the respondent experience. Text analysis features such as Word Cloud visualizations and Sentiment Analysis take the time and effort out of analyzing open-ended survey responses, providing instant insights into what respondents think and feel;
 •Analysis: Our products enable the filtering and comparison of data by cohort, geography, gender, time period, collection method, and more. We help customers weave together data to form a narrative that answers the “why,” which enables them to better understand customer and employee attitudes, predict market appetite, and identify meaningful opportunities more quickly; and
 •Integrations: As discussed in more detail below, our products integrate with a customer’s existing systems of record, allowing them to act on the insights we deliver in the systems they already use to get work done. This allows our customers to improve retention and satisfaction of their customers, maximize employee engagement and retention, and tailor new products to the demands of prospective customers, among other things. SurveyMonkey products also integrate with business applications, as described below.
 The core survey platform also supports the panel capabilities discussed in the “—Insights Solutions” and “—Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations” sections below.
 Individual Plans
 We offer our “Basic” survey plan to individuals at no charge. We also offer multiple tiers of subscriptions to individual paying users through our self-serve channel, with pricing based on volume of data collected and functionality, including: advanced survey logic; branding and customization tools; analysis features; and support options.
Business Plans
 SurveyMonkey team plans: Team plans are designed for small teams and departments that need to collaborate on survey projects. In addition to the features available in paid plans for individuals, SurveyMonkey team plans provide advanced collaboration features for survey creation and analysis, centralized team administration, and a team library for survey themes, templates and brand assets. Team plans start at three users per team, billed annually on a subscription basis, and include flexible roles and pricing for survey creators and analysts. Team plans are sold through our self-serve channel.
 SurveyMonkey Enterprise: For organizations, we offer SurveyMonkey Enterprise, an AI-powered enterprise feedback management platform that extends SurveyMonkey with enterprise-grade security and an enhanced set of capabilities (including managed user accounts, customized company branding, collaboration capabilities, and deep integrations with a broad set of leading enterprise software applications) that enable users to support multiple, advanced feedback use cases across the organization. Features include:
 •Enterprise-Grade Security: We provide centralized data ownership and access management across accounts with encryption and compliance with key standards, including ISO 27001, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). We have also achieved SOC 2 Type 2 certification for our SurveyMonkey and GetFeedback platforms to meet the requirements of large, global customers across industries, including the defense, financial services and healthcare sectors;


•Integration and Compatibility: We also offer pre-built integrations and data portability with applications such as those offered by Salesforce, Marketo, Tableau, and Microsoft – allowing for greater workflow automation and operationalized feedback programs, as well as API access for developers who wish to create their own internal apps leveraging feedback data;
 •Managed Accounts and Users: Our survey platform enables organizations to centrally manage users and teams. Within an organization, all survey accounts can be consolidated under a single corporate identity to centralize billing, administration, restrictions and defaults, and access management; and
 •Collaboration: Users can create and share surveys between and within departments allowing others to review, add comments and make edits. Teams gain access to a shared library that ensures consistent organizational branding and survey methodology across all team member accounts, utilizing the images, themes, style preferences and templates for surveys and results presentations that fit an organization’s preferences, as well as a corporate question bank to ensure consistency across surveys deployed by an organization.
 SurveyMonkey Enterprise is built on top of our core survey platform and is sold through our sales-assisted channel. We negotiate deployments with organizations based on functionality, the number of users, and the volume of data collected.
 Revenue from Surveys is generated primarily on a subscription basis.
 Customer Experience
 In addition to our core survey platform, we offer a purpose-built Customer Experience solution that enables companies to leverage in-the-moment customer feedback to deliver experiences that engage and retain their customers. Our Customer Experience solution simplifies customer feedback collection and analysis through its integration with customer relationship management (“CRM”) and customer support data to help companies better understand key customer segments, and its accessibility within the systems companies already use to help them take action quickly in service of their customers. Our Customer Experience solution captures a company’s customer feedback from across key digital channels and within offline or proprietary business systems, combines this feedback with operational customer data to build a deeper understanding of their customers and their preferences, and automates feedback-based actions through integrations with that company’s existing system of record and other key business systems. We differentiate our Customer Experience solution in the market based on our software’s ease-of-implementation and use, time-to-value relative to alternative solutions, and rich integration across the Salesforce and Zendesk ecosystems.
 Our Customer Experience solution consists of products and features, such as:
 •Open text & sentiment analysis: Leverages Momentive’s artificial intelligence engine to analyze open text responses and quickly understand customer sentiment which enables companies to gain insights quickly from large amounts of unstructured text-based feedback. The feature identifies the top keywords and analyzes the sentiment of phrases within open text responses;
 •Automations layer & webhooks: Expedites the setup of custom, targeted alerts and actions that automatically push customer feedback and its associated metadata across an organization via email or through systems like Salesforce or Slack. Webhooks extends these automations across any system that can ingest them, enabling companies to push feedback across even more of its tech stack to drive action that help engage and retain customers;
 •Embedded listener: Enables companies to leverage a simple application programming interface (“API”) to collect feedback through any proprietary system (ATM, kiosk, Smart TV, etc.) while adhering to a company’s strict brand and security standards;
 •Slack integration: Streamlines feedback response and follow up within Slack to help companies reduce their customer response times. This feature enables companies to create conditions for when Slack notifications are sent based on specific customer feedback, and then push this feedback automatically across one or more Slack channels;
 •Enhanced Salesforce integration: Companies can now integrate customer experience data from their websites and mobile apps into Salesforce so they can act on feedback across their entire customer lifecycle;


•Zendesk integration: Customers who use Zendesk can improve survey response rates, uncover actionable trends, quickly notify the right person or teams for specific follow up, and aggregate all customer feedback in one place to identify trends by channel;
 •Salesforce Managed App: Automatically push the results of surveys right into Salesforce through a Customer Experience app to help drive awareness and accountability for customer experience programs; and
 •Program Accelerator: Enables companies to launch recurring customer experience programs, easily and at scale, through turnkey templates. Companies can select customer contacts and pre-built survey and email templates based on customer experience best practices to quickly execute customer experience programs and help drive better customer experiences.
 We offer the following Customer Experience plans, which can be purchased as a platform, or as individual solutions:
 •GetFeedback Essentials: Gives companies the tools to launch customer experience programs quickly by gathering feedback via email and across their websites, analyzing it in one place, and integrating with their Salesforce CRM platform;
 •GetFeedback Pro: Includes the Essentials plan’s features and adds more feedback collection channels (SMS and chat), advanced analytics, automation and additional pre-built integrations to better assist teams that are scaling their CX programs;
 •GetFeedback Ultimate: Includes the Pro plan features and adds mobile apps as a feedback collection channel and enables single sign-on (“SSO”), which is leveraged by enterprise customers looking to collect feedback across multiple channels;
 •GetFeedback Direct: Can be purchased as a stand-alone solution for customers who are focused on improving in areas like NPS and CSAT. Its deep integration with Salesforce is particularly helpful for customer support and service teams when targeting the right audiences to send surveys at the right time; and
 •GetFeedback Digital: Can be purchased as a stand-alone solution for customers who are focused on leveraging feedback to improve their websites and mobile apps. Customers deploy web and app surveys quickly, and without engineering help, to improve user experiences and friction points in these digital channels. 
 Our Customer Experience offering is sold through our sales-assisted channel.
 Revenue from Customer Experience is generated primarily on a subscription basis.
 Insights Solutions
 Formerly known as Market Research, our Insights Solutions products enable customers to quickly collect and analyze actionable insights from a targeted audience on a number of market research needs, including analyzing market opportunities, measuring brand and campaign effectiveness, and gaining insights on existing and future product lines.
 •Audience panel: Powered by our own proprietary sources as well as integrations with vetted partners, our market research panel solution enables organizations to conduct market research projects from stakeholders with whom they do not have a direct relationship from a representative sample of consumers to a niche group of business-to-business (“B2B”) decision makers. Our Audience panel enables organizations to collect and analyze real‐time actionable data from high-quality targeted panelists. Our panel is directly integrated into our survey platform as well as our market research solutions to allow self-service access to these respondents.
 •Purpose-built solutions: For common, repeatable market research use cases, we have a suite of solutions that streamline the study creation, data collection, and analysis experience into a guided flow. Industry-proven methodologies are built directly into our solutions to ensure the most relevant, accurate data possible. Customers can get started quickly with our easy-to-follow frameworks, or customize their study to meet any requirement. Packaged analysis modules include scorecards with statistical testing, key drivers analysis, configurable dashboards, longitudinal data visualizations, and more. With these artificial 


intelligence-powered solutions, customers can get actionable insights in hours, compared to the weeks or months it would take a traditional agency. Our purpose-built insights solutions include:

 Insights Solutions is built on top of our core survey platform and is sold through our sales-assisted channel. Revenue from Insights Solutions is generated primarily on a transactional basis, with our customers having the option to preload credits that can be used to pay for projects, solutions, and services throughout a 12-month term. In the third quarter of 2022, we launched a program to price certain Insights Solutions on a subscription basis for new customers. We expect to expand this initiative throughout 2023.

agencies, manufacturing, energy, education, professional services and non-profit organizations. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 330,000 organizational domain customers, which are customers who register with us using an email account with an organizational domain name such as @momentive.ai or @surveymonkey.com, but excludes customers with email addresses hosted on widely used domains such as @gmail, @outlook or @yahoo. As of December 31, 2022, over 90% of our trailing 12-month bookings were from organizational domain-based customers. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 14,500 customers who purchased our software through our sales-assisted channel. No customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We are executing on a two-part growth strategy. First, we are delivering new features and product tiers that capitalize on the virality of our core platform and the scale of business to drive overall platform usage and increase the conversion of free users to paid subscribers in our self-serve channel. Second, we are investing further in product innovation and go-to-market initiatives to expand the percentage of our revenue generated through our sales-assisted channel. Specifically, our sales-assisted go-to-market motion focuses on: converting existing self-serve subscribers to sales-assisted customers, selling directly to new customers, and expanding our relationships with existing customers.
 Our core survey platform is inherently viral, as existing users send surveys and share survey results that introduce potential new users and customers to our products. This virality, combined with the ease-of-use and price-disruptive nature of our products and the strength of our brands, has enabled us to build an efficient, online self-serve channel for selling versions of our survey products, which we are enhancing with our sales-assisted go-to-market motion. Additionally, our user base includes individuals and teams within organizations who are using our software to collect feedback for business use cases related to their employees, current customers, and potential new customers and markets. Thus, our self-serve channel also serves as a renewable source of prospective customers for our sales team to introduce SurveyMonkey Enterprise and our Customer Experience and Insights Solutions enterprise product categories. We believe this installed base of organization-based customers represents a significant opportunity to drive new business and expand existing relationships with enterprises, which we believe can increase our revenue growth and customer retention rates over time. We believe our existing user base represents a significant opportunity to expand our business and increase our revenue.
 Self-Serve Initiatives
 Our initiatives to drive continued product-led growth through our self-serve channel include:
 •Optimization of traffic to our website through search engine optimization, search engine marketing and other paid digital marketing programs, and marketing on the end page of surveys deployed;
 •Continued account verification to reduce unauthorized account sharing;
 •Further changes in self-serve product tiers, pricing, and packaging to convert more users of our free “Basic” survey plan into paid subscription plans, and to drive upgrades to higher paid subscriptions for our existing paid customers;
 •Deeper and additional product integrations with popular third-party business applications like Microsoft Teams and Zoom Video Communications to drive increased usage of our survey platform, which helps drive more self-serve product usage and subscriptions and identifies potential customers and SurveyMonkey Enterprise prospects; and
 •Continued scaling of our multi-user SurveyMonkey teams products that enables small groups to collaborate on survey creation and analysis and provides an upsell opportunity for SurveyMonkey Enterprise.
 Enterprise Growth Initiatives
 Our enterprise, or sales-assisted, growth strategy starts with our brand recognition, our existing user base within organizations, and use of our technology to identify opportunities to convert active users to paying users, upsell organizations to SurveyMonkey Enterprise and cross-sell our Customer Experience and Insights Solutions products. Our goal is to increase our total number of enterprise customers and expand our business with existing enterprise customers over time. As we execute on this strategy, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth rate and increase both monetization and retention within organizations over time.


•Our enterprise growth strategy includes:
 oExpanding Relationships with Existing Self-Serve Customers: Analyzing our self-serve customer base to identify and market to prospective purchasers of SurveyMonkey Enterprise and our Customer Experience and Insights Solutions enterprise product categories;
 oExpanding Relationships with Existing Sales-Assisted Customers: Once we win business in one functional area of an organization (e.g. human resources), we seek to expand our relationship with other parts of the customer’s organization through up-selling more of the enterprise product category already purchased by the customer and/or cross-selling our other enterprise product categories, depending on the needs of the customer;
 oGo-to-Market: Driving continued increased productivity of our sales team through continued investments in enablement, training, cross-selling, and newer pricing models, such as consumption-based with SurveyMonkey Enterprise and a subscription-based model for Insights Solutions;
 oProduct Innovation: We continue to add new features to SurveyMonkey Enterprise, Customer Experience and Insights Solutions products; and
 oPartnerships/Integrations: We plan to increasingly leverage our 100+ existing integrations with platforms offered by Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, HubSpot, Zendesk, and others to power insights within an enterprise customer’s existing systems of record and drive greater adoption of our enterprise product categories.
 Other Growth Initiatives
 Expanding our business in key international markets: For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we generated 35%, 36% and 35% of our revenue from customers outside of the United States, respectively, and we see significant opportunity for growth internationally. We are investing in marketing our self-serve products and increasing awareness of our brand, developing a more localized product experience and expanding our international data center presence to improve user experience and website speed, and to provide locally hosted data.
Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations
 Our products are centered on innovation in the following areas:
 •Scalable Data Collection: Data can be collected via iOS and Android mobile apps, web browsers, personalized emails and social media or collaboration platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Slack. In addition, data collection can be programmatically embedded and customized to sit within a customer’s website or mobile app and pop-up invitations. Additionally, we offer access via SurveyMonkey Anywhere, our offline data collection mode and via QR codes.
 •Data Storage and Analysis: Our architecture allows us to collect data in multiple geographic locales. Our systems are hosted in U.S. and European regions within Amazon Web Services. In addition, we enable certain accounts to store their SurveyMonkey data in other geographic regions hosted by Amazon Web Services.
 •Reliability: We have designed our products to be highly available under peak global load conditions. To enable redundancy and backup, we replicate customer data across multiple data centers in multiple availability zones in each of the U.S. and European regions within Amazon Web Services.
 •Security: Our core survey platform can be connected to enterprise identity management systems such as Microsoft Active Directory and OKTA and can be configured to enable administrators to automate the management of licenses and system access. 
 •Integration into Customer Systems and Processes: Companies can integrate SurveyMonkey into their systems and processes by using our pre-built connectors, using one of many third-party applications built on our survey platform, or via a custom integration using our open APIs. 
 We are focused on research and development to enhance our survey platform, develop new products and features, and improve our infrastructure.


Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success
 We believe our SurveyMonkey brand is globally synonymous with collecting feedback. We benefit from the virality of our core platform, where survey creators increase our exposure organically among the respondents to their surveys, and every person who takes a survey is a potential future customer. In addition, our marketing function supports our sales effort targeted at organizations currently using our survey platform as well as prospective new customers seeking enterprise-grade solutions across our three major product categories.
 In our self-serve channel, we conduct direct response marketing and engage and reactivate users through communication channels such as in-product notifications, demand generation campaigns, mobile notifications and lifecycle email marketing. We also create brand awareness through search engine optimization, content marketing, social media marketing, public relations and earned media with partners.
 In our sales-assisted channel, we have built direct, inside sales teams focused on new sales and cross-sales of our SaaS offerings into small, midsize, and large enterprises. To help us engage more deeply with enterprise sales customers, we rebranded ourselves as “Momentive” in June 2021 and changed our legal name from “SVMK Inc.” to “Momentive Global Inc.”
 Our customer success initiatives include an online knowledge base and help center, localized in 16 languages, as well as phone-based, email-based, and dedicated customer support that correspond to the product tier customers have purchased across our major product categories.
Competition
 Competitors in the various product categories we offer include Qualtrics, Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo), Typeform, Google, and Microsoft in Surveys; Medallia, InMoment, Qualtrics, and Salesforce surveys in Customer Experience; and Nielsen, Kantar, Qualtrics, and YouGov in Insights Solutions. We also compete with offline methods of feedback collection, such as pen-and-paper surveys and telephone surveys. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
 •ease of use and deployment of applications;
 •quality and timeliness of data and insight generation;
 •product features, quality and functionality;
 •volume of data for benchmarking, data science models and artificial intelligence and machine learning applications;
 •pricing, total cost of ownership and visibility into cost over time;
 •brand awareness and reputation;
 •breadth of customer base and level of user adoption;
 •ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
 •security, reliability and scalability across organizations;
 •flexibility to cover a wide breadth of use cases globally;
 •ability to enable collaboration within teams and across different business lines;
 •effectiveness of sales and marketing;
 •customer experience; and
 •vision for the market and product innovation.
 Some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, broader distribution or established relationships, or lower labor and research and development costs than we have. Our competitors may devote greater resources and time on developing and testing products and solutions, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products and solutions than we do.
 Regulatory Matters
 We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages (and related traffic data where applicable), human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety,

intellectual property and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax regulations, which are continuously evolving and developing. We also have privacy-related terms and guidelines for third-party developers to create applications that connect to our products.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had seven issued patents and three pending patent applications in the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business.
 Employee and Human Capital Resources
 At Momentive, we are on a mission to Power the Curious. Our employee value proposition is to be: A Place Where the Curious Come to Grow and our values guide us every day. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone—no matter their background—can succeed, feel a sense of belonging, and learn from one another. We believe our team around the world delivers value to our customers and drives our business outcomes, and as such, we make significant investments to attract, retain, grow and develop our employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had about 1,400 employees worldwide, of whom about 560 were based outside of the United States; 24% of our employees have been with us for less than one year, and 26% have been with us for more than one year but less than two years.
 Momentive’s workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, compensation, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity.
 Culture and Values
 Our team is collaborative, inclusive, and driven to make a positive impact that extends far beyond our office doors. Our core values are Stay Curious, Innovate for Customers, Make it Happen, Trust the Team and Stand for Equality. Our core values help shape our business decisions, define our culture, and inspire our growth. Through our choices, words, and actions, we strive to live our values each and every day. Our value of Stay Curious means curiosity is our superpower, and we embrace a growth mindset; we take risks and we learn from outcomes. Our value of Innovate for Customers means we grow alongside our customers, and to deliver value to them, we understand, we act – and we keep at it. Our value of Make it Happen means our customers, colleagues, and community inspires us to compete, win and give back, and we focus, we act with integrity and we own the results. Our value of Trust the Team means we succeed as one global team, we are accountable to one another, value opinions and communicate with clarity and kindness, and we prioritize health and support one another. Our value of Stand for Equality means we champion diversity and welcome individuality, and together, we create an equitable workplace where each person can truly belong and do their best work.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) improve employee experience, help us understand and serve our customers better, and make us a stronger business. With the strong support of our CEO and leadership, and true passion from our employees, we strive to be an industry leader, create an inspiring culture and have a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Our Chief Diversity & Social Impact Officer (“CDSIO”) leads a dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. We report our DEI initiatives quarterly to our board of directors and relevant committees of our board of directors.
We track our DEI goals rigorously, and our strategy is operationalized through the following elements:
 •Goals and transparency: We take a data-driven approach to DEI, because you can’t change what you don’t measure. We have set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation of women and 


racially and ethnically diverse employees (which we define as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, Indigenous, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races) in our workforce. We began sharing our diversity goals externally in 2019;
 •Center of Excellence: We have a cross-functional team led by the CDSIO with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace;
 •Employee Resource Groups: Eight employee resource groups bring together team members from all backgrounds and experience and aid in building community across the globe; they empower caregivers, the LGBTQ+ community, the neurodivergent, women, nonbinary and women engineers, and our Black, Latinx and Asian and Pacific Islander employees; together, they drive awareness, create career development opportunities and serve as a vital resource for our business;
 •Diversity, Inclusion, and Impact groups: We have dedicated diversity, inclusion, and impact groups (“DIIGs”) in various offices that drive locally relevant events, programming, and training to foster an inclusive work environment in their office and the local community;
 •Engagement: We survey our team biannually to understand their sense of belonging and what changes are needed; 
 •Talent acquisition: We have a diversity sourcing team to help build a pipeline of diverse candidates and invest in programs to support our diversity strategy and initiatives;
 •Accountability: Our board of directors and executives review our progress towards our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least quarterly.
 As of December 31, 2022:
 •Women constituted 50% of our board of directors, 43% of our total employees, 47% of our leadership roles (director and above roles), and 26% of our technology roles (engineering, product, design, research and analytics, and IT roles); and
 •Our racially and ethnically diverse employees (employees who have self-identified as Black, Latinx/Hispanic, Indigenous, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races) represent 19% of our U.S. and Canada employees, 9% of our U.S. and Canada leadership (director and above roles), and 15% of our U.S. and Canada technology roles (engineering, product, design, research and analytics, and IT roles).
Total Rewards
 Our compensation programs are designed to reward and recognize the contributions of employees in support of our mission and strategic goals. We strive to offer competitive total rewards which include: salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, benefits, and perks to our team around the globe. Benefits and perks include high-quality medical, dental and vision plans, commuter benefits, financial coaching, legal counsel, retirement plans with company matching, paid time-off, paid parental leave and family support, and global mental health resources.
Learning and Development
 We foster a culture where our employees can learn and grow—from our Goldie Speaker Series with leaders and thinkers from around the world, to online learning opportunities, mentoring programs, manager trainings and career conversations with leaders at the company. We have a culture of continuous feedback, and in lieu of the traditional year end performance reviews, our employees have quarterly GIG (growth, impact and goals) conversations with their managers, which are employee-led meetings held at the start of each quarter to reflect on the growth and impact made in the last quarter and to set goals for the upcoming quarter.
Support for Employees in a Hybrid Work Environment
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a hybrid work environment, where most of our employees have the flexibility to determine the amount of time they work from home and in our offices. All employee onboarding and training processes have also been transitioned to remote or online programs. We have made investments to support remote working collaboration to ensure our employees are as productive at home as they would be in our offices worldwide and to promote employee well-being while working in a hybrid work environment, such as

additional mental health and wellness benefits and special reimbursements designed to support our employees and their families.
The health, well-being and safety of our employees is a top priority. We will continue to monitor COVID-related developments, including local restrictions across the world, the administration of vaccines and the number of new cases.
Employee Engagement
 We hold monthly Town Hall meetings to provide our employees updates and insights on the state of our business, to provide a forum for employees to ask questions and engage with executive leadership at the company, and to recognize colleagues and celebrate wins across the company. We also conduct biannual engagement surveys which allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on our culture, employee happiness, company strategy and trust in executive management as well as their direct leaders. We use these survey results to drive our engagement initiatives.
Labor Relations
 Our employees in the Netherlands are represented by a works council and none of our other employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as indicated by the results of our internal survey on employee engagement.
Corporate Social Impact
 Through our corporate social impact program, Momentive Together, we act on our convictions to spark meaningful change. Momentive Together is how we put our values into action through philanthropic and community minded commitments such as our annual Week of Service, employee donation matching, and SurveyMonkey Contribute, our nonprofit donation program integrated into the Audience product. At its heart is our belief that together we can drive real progress for equity, sustainability and social justice – to help improve the world we currently live in and shape a better future for everyone.
Our efforts are centered around three pillars that we believe are imperative for a better world:
 •Educational Equity: Tech companies like ours need to invest in future leaders. All students deserve access to educational programs and resources that will empower them to learn and grow. We pledge to expand opportunities for low-income and underserved early education and secondary students by supporting programs that provide high-value, equitable education.
 •Reshaping the Workforce: Marginalized communities need meaningful access to employment pipelines, mentorship, and career development opportunities. We want to help dismantle and reimagine inequitable systems, while ensuring that everyone has what they need to succeed.
 •Environmental Responsibility: We believe it’s up to us to minimize our organizational and individual impact on the environment. From our real estate and supply chain to our travel decisions, we’re committed to monitoring our greenhouse gas emissions and reducing our carbon footprint.
 Corporate Information
 Momentive Global Inc. was incorporated in October 2011 as SVMK Inc., a Delaware corporation, and is the successor to operations originally begun in 1999. In June 2021, SVMK Inc. was rebranded as “Momentive” and its legal name was changed to Momentive Global Inc. As a result, its common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “MNTV” instead of “SVMK” on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. In February 2022, we announced plans to consolidate our product portfolio under two brands and web surfaces—Momentive and SurveyMonkey. The Momentive brand represents our suite of upmarket solutions, while the SurveyMonkey brand supports our complementary products for value-oriented customers who prioritize speed and ease of use. Our principal executive offices are located at One Curiosity Way, San Mateo, California 94403, and our telephone number is (650) 543-8400. Our website address is www.momentive.ai.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and any worsening of the economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not currently aware of.
Summary Risk Factors
 The following summarizes the most material risks that make an investment in our securities risky or speculative. If any of the following risks occur or persist, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock could significantly decline:
Business and Operations
 •our financial results depend on our ability to attract and retain customers, convert unpaid users to customers, and develop and expand relationships with organizational customers;
 •our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may slow in the future;
 •our business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our customer and user base, our market share and our ability to attract and retain employees;
 •as a substantial portion of our revenue-generating efforts are increasingly targeted at winning sales-assisted customers, we may not succeed in building an efficient and effective salesforce or managing our sales channels effectively, our sales cycle has and may become lengthier and more expensive, we may encounter greater pricing pressure and our customers may be displeased with our support and services;


•our inability to successfully retain our existing senior management and other key personnel or to attract and retain new qualified personnel could materially and adversely impact our ability to operate, develop or manage our business;
 •general global economic conditions (including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and the impact of climate change) and our inability to compete successfully in our markets may materially and adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions;
 Information Technology and Cybersecurity
 •we have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the performance of our network infrastructure, websites, other systems and those of third-party service providers, including server failures that temporarily impair or disable the performance of our websites due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints and denial of service or fraud or security attacks;
 •we are vulnerable to software bugs, computer viruses, break-ins, ransomware or phishing attacks, employee errors or malfeasance, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or confidential information;
 •if we experienced a widespread security breach or other incident that impacted a significant number of our customers to whom we owe indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage; 
 •the introduction of new products and solutions by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our survey platform and other solutions obsolete or adversely affect our business;
 •a disruption in the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems and digital monitoring technologies may materially and adversely affect our operations and result in loss of revenue, data breaches, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity costs or non-compliance with certain laws and regulations, which may result in litigation or reputational damage;
 Financial or Operating Results
•we have substantial indebtedness and lease obligations, which reduce our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions;
 •we may have difficulty operating or integrating any acquired businesses, assets or product lines profitably due to our failure to manage the growth effectively, the interruption of, or delays in, the operation of our existing business or other factors within or beyond our control;
 •our international sales and operations may present additional risks, including, but not limited to, changes to trade protection measures, taxation policies or other laws and regulations, currency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on currency repatriation, labor disturbances and political instability;
 •we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value and repurchases could increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves;
Regulatory and Tax Compliance
 •there has been increased uncertainty around the legality of various mechanisms for personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States and other countries outside the European Union and if the mechanisms on which we rely for the transfer of data are found to be invalid or are modified or replaced, our business could be substantially and materially impacted;
 •any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy or data protection policies or legal obligations to customers, respondents, users or other third parties, or any compromise of security that 


results in the unauthorized disclosure, transfer or use of personal or other information, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements critical of us by consumer advocacy groups, competitors, the media or others and could cause our users to lose trust in our offerings; and
 •our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property from third‑party infringement, or claims that we are infringing on a third party’s intellectual property rights, may result in competitive harm, the expenditure of significant time and resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims, or restrictions on our sale of products or services.
 
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
 Our business depends on our ability to retain, upsell and cross-sell customers, and any decline in renewals, upsells or cross-sells could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Our business depends upon our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with our users. Customers can choose between monthly or annual subscriptions, and customers are not obligated to and may not renew their paid subscriptions after their existing plans expire. As a result, we cannot assure that customers will renew their paid plans utilizing the same tier of our products and solutions or upgrade to our premium products or solutions. Renewals of paid plans may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products, solutions or support, a user no longer having a need for our products or reducing IT spending, such as in response to current or future economic and global market uncertainties or downturns, or the perception that competitive products are better or less expensive options. As our customer base continues to grow, even if our customer retention rates remain the same on a percentage basis, the absolute number of customers we lose each month will increase. We must continually add new customers to replace customers whose accounts are closed and to grow our business beyond our current user base, which may involve significantly higher marketing expenses than we currently anticipate.
We invest in new features and improvements to our product functionality as well as targeted marketing campaigns to drive conversion of unpaid users to paying users. Individual users often bring us into their organization for business purposes, and from there we seek to establish an organizational relationship through the deployment of our enterprise solutions. As we scale within organizations, we seek to further grow the business relationship by cross-selling purpose-built solutions. If our customers do not renew or cancel their subscriptions, or if we fail to upsell our customers to higher tier individual subscriptions or to enterprise solutions, or if we fail to cross-sell additional products and services to our customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.
 Additionally, many of our users initially register to use our free basic survey product. We strive to demonstrate the value of our products to our registered users, thereby encouraging them to convert to paying users through end-of-survey marketing. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 14 million active users, of which approximately 887,400 were paying users. The actual number of unique users may be lower than we report as one person could count as multiple, active users or paying users. For example, if an individual paying user also had a designated seat in a SurveyMonkey Enterprise deployment, we would count that person as two paying users. As a result, we may have fewer unique users that we may be able to convert, upsell or cross-sell. Our inability to determine the number of our unique users is a limitation in the data that we measure and may adversely affect our understanding of certain aspects of our business and make it more challenging to manage our business. Most of our active users never convert to a paying user, and if we are unable to convert free users to paying users, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
Our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may slow in the future.
We have a history of delivering revenue growth and positive cash flow from operations. However, our rates of revenue growth have fluctuated, and may slow in the future. Many factors may contribute to declines in our growth rates, including higher market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our survey platform, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, the maturation of our business, and impacts resulting from general macroeconomic conditions or the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. It can be difficult to predict customer demand, especially as their priorities, resources and economic outlook change, along with other shifting market conditions. These shifts have occurred and may in the future occur more quickly than we anticipate. If we are unable to respond quickly to rapidly changing market conditions and shifts in customer behavior, our business and results of operation could be harmed, and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. You should

not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. If our growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
Our business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our customer and user base, our market share and our ability to attract and retain employees.
 We have developed a strong and trusted brand of “SurveyMonkey” that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. In June 2021, we rebranded and changed our name from SVMK Inc. to Momentive Global Inc. We may not be able to maintain or benefit from name recognition or status under the “Momentive” brand as we did using the “SurveyMonkey” brand, as investors may not understand or appreciate our rebranding efforts. We believe that enhancing and maintaining awareness of all of our brands, including “Momentive” and “SurveyMonkey”, in a cost-effective manner is critical to our goal of achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products, attracting new customers and attracting and retaining top talent. Furthermore, we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world, and we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our industry increases. Successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing and media partnership efforts and the effectiveness and affordability of our products for our target customer demographic. Such brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and, even if they do, any revenue increases may not offset the expenses we incur to promote our brand. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy or data protection practices, terms of service, service quality, the launch of “Momentive” as our parent brand, litigation, regulatory activity or the perception of inaccurate poll data from properly or improperly drafted surveys by third parties using our survey platform, the actions of our partners and customers or the actions of other companies that provide similar products and solutions to ours, could adversely affect our reputation, brand, the size and engagement of our user base and our ability to attract and retain users. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands successfully, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may lose our existing customers to our competitors or be unable to attract new customers or employees, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
As a substantial portion of our revenue-generating efforts are increasingly targeted at winning sales-assisted customers, our sales cycle has and may become lengthier and more expensive, we may encounter greater pricing pressure and our customers may be displeased with our customer support, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.
 As a substantial portion of our revenue-generating efforts are increasingly targeted at prospective sales-assisted customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in the completion of some of our sales. In this market, the customer’s decision to use our products may be an enterprise-wide decision, in which case these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of customer education to familiarize these customers with the uses, features and benefits of our products and purpose-built solutions, as well as education regarding our security and governance practices and compliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations, especially for those customers in more heavily-regulated industries. In addition, larger enterprises may demand more support services and features, which puts additional pressure on our support and success organizations to satisfy the increased support required for our customers. Further, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide efficient customer support that meets our customers’ needs globally at scale. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional survey platform resources to paying users in order to familiarize these new customers with our value proposition, or require us to hire additional support personnel, which could increase our costs, further lengthen our sales cycle and divert our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger customers, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions. These significant expenditures in time and money may not result in a sale. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality or interoperability of our products and solutions with their own IT environment, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, which could adversely affect our margins. Moreover, any customer dissatisfaction with our products and solutions, or a failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could damage our ability to encourage broader adoption of our products by that customer and generate positive recommendations to other potential users. In addition, any negative publicity resulting from such situations, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.

We may not succeed in building an efficient and effective salesforce, and we may fail to manage our sales channels effectively.
 While a growing portion of our revenue in recent periods has been derived from our sales efforts, we are investing in strategically developing an efficient, effective and robust salesforce, particularly internationally where our brand is less well known, but we may not be as successful as we anticipate. Our limited experience selling directly to small, medium and large organizations through our salesforce may impede our future growth. Further, our ability to manage a larger direct salesforce is uncertain and we have faced challenges, including reducing the size and adjusting the composition of our sales team in 2022. Identifying and recruiting additional qualified sales personnel and training them requires significant time, expense and attention. In addition, many organizations undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process, which can lengthen our sales cycle, and some organizations demand more specialized features on our survey platform. We may spend substantial time, effort and money on sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. As a result, our sales efforts may lead to greater unpredictability in our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Additionally, we have global partners who broaden the scope of our market research solutions by providing access to additional panelists around the world. Our partners are generally in nonexclusive agreements with us, are not subject to minimum obligations, and may be terminated at any time without cause. If we fail to manage our sales efforts successfully or they otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, it could reduce our sales and increase our expenses, as well as weaken our competitive position.
Our industry is intensely competitive, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.
 Our products face intense competition from many different companies, including but not limited to:
•Qualtrics, Alchemer (formerly SurveyGizmo), Typeform, Google and Microsoft in Surveys; 
 •Medallia, InMoment, Qualtrics and Salesforce Surveys in Customer Experience; and 
 •Nielsen, Kantar, Qualtrics and YouGov in Insights Solutions. 
 These competitors vary in size, and many have significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have, larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, broader distribution or established relationships or lower labor and research and development costs. We also compete with offline methods of information collection, such as pen-and-paper surveys, telephone surveys, forms and applications and less-automated methods such as email. Our competitors may devote greater resources and time on developing and testing products and solutions, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns and partnerships, adopt more aggressive pricing policies or otherwise develop more commercially successful products and solutions than we do. Our competitors may have preexisting relationships which required significant upfront investment by the customer, and these customers may prefer to continue existing and established relationships rather than adopt our survey platform. We cannot assure that we will be able to increase or maintain the large user base that we currently enjoy.
There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. As a result, we are likely to face additional and intense competition from new entrants into the market in the future. There can be no assurance that existing or future competitors will not develop or offer products that provide significant performance, price, speed, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, and this could have an adverse effect on our business. We also operate in a highly fragmented market, and consolidation of our competitors or customers may also adversely affect our business. In addition, historically, our business has enjoyed relatively high margins and growth, which may attract new competition into our markets, including competition from companies employing alternate business models. Loss of existing or future market share to current or new competitors and increased price competition could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture and our business may be harmed.
 We have worked to develop a strong culture around our team, which is built on four key pillars of celebrating curiosity, maintaining a diverse, collaborative and inclusive work environment, seeking to positively influence our industry and community, and delivering value to our customers. We believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a critical contributor to our success. We expect to continue to hire strategically as needed in alignment with our business strategy, and we believe our corporate culture has been crucial in our success and our ability to attract highly skilled personnel. If we do not continue to develop our corporate culture or maintain and preserve our core values as we grow and evolve both in the United States and internationally, we may be unable to foster the

innovation, curiosity, creativity, focus on execution, teamwork and the facilitation of critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing we believe we need to support our growth. Preservation of our corporate culture is also made more difficult due to restructuring initiatives we have executed that have resulted in changes throughout our business, including the implementation of the workforce reduction from restructuring plans, and due to our shift to a hybrid work model, where most of our employees have the flexibility to determine the amount of time they work from home or in our offices, each of which may present operational challenges and risks, including negative employee morale and productivity, failure to attract and retain qualified employees, and increased compliance and tax obligations in a number of jurisdictions. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth or restructuring initiatives in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, our employee retention may suffer, which could harm our business.
 We depend on our talent to develop, manage and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, integrate, develop, motivate and retain our personnel, we may not be able to manage our business effectively.
 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify, hire, integrate, develop, motivate and retain top talent, including senior management, engineers, designers, product managers, sales representatives and customer support representatives. Our ability to execute efficiently is dependent upon contributions from all of our employees, in particular our senior management team. As our business continues to develop and evolve, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract new employees or retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position, and this risk may be exacerbated by factors related to restructuring initiatives, the volatility of our stock price and increased recruiting efforts by other companies. Competition for these resources, particularly for engineers, is intense. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity for new and existing employees and have invested heavily in our facilities to accommodate our employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. In addition, our restructuring initiatives, including the implementation of the workforce reduction from restructuring plans, and any future restructuring initiatives could have an adverse effect on our business, including negative employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed. Employees may be more likely to resign if the shares they own or the shares underlying their equity incentive awards have significantly appreciated or significantly reduced in value, or the trading price of our common stock continues to be volatile, including the recent volatility in our trading price.
In addition, our future also depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, or to find a suitable replacement for key executives on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all, could seriously harm our business. Although we have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with our key employees, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team, including through restructuring initiatives, that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.



Risks Related to Information Technology and Cybersecurity
 Any significant disruption in service or security on our websites or in our systems could result in a loss of users, damage to our reputation and harm to our business.
 Our brand, reputation and ability to attract and retain users and customers depend in part upon the reliable performance of our network infrastructure, websites, other systems and those of third-party service providers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in these systems, including server failures that temporarily impair or disable the performance of our websites due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to rectify or even identify the cause or causes of these site performance problems within an acceptable period of time. As our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases, we expect that it will become increasingly challenging to maintain and improve the performance of our products and solutions, especially during peak usage times. If our products are unavailable to users or fail to function as quickly as users expect, it could result in reduced customer satisfaction and reduced attractiveness of our products to customers. This in turn could lead to decreased sales to new customers, harm our ability to retain existing customers and the issuance of service credits or refunds, any of which could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We expect to continue to make significant investments to build new products and enhance the features and functionality of our existing products and solutions. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed. Further, even if we are able to upgrade our systems, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention. Additionally, problems with the reliability or security of our systems, including unauthorized access to, or improper use of, the information of our users, could result in the loss of intellectual property, the introduction of malicious code to our applications, or harm to our reputation and negatively affect our business. Affected users could also initiate legal or regulatory action against us in connection with such incidents, which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices.
We may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to rapid technological changes, enhance our existing products and solutions or develop new products.
 The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introductions of new products and solutions, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from existing customers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our products and solutions, introduce new products and solutions, anticipate and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems and third-party applications. The success of our products depends on our continued investment in our research and development organization to increase the accessibility, ease-of-use and interoperability of our existing solutions and the development of features and functionality that users may require.
The introduction of new products and solutions by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our survey platform and other solutions obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or implementation of our product experiences, features or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities, and we cannot assure you that new product experiences, features or capabilities will be released according to schedule. If users do not widely adopt our survey platform or purchase our products and services, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we do not accurately anticipate user demand or we are unable to develop, license or acquire new features and capabilities on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, it could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance or claims by users brought against us, each of which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
If our security measures are compromised, or if our websites are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users and respondents to access our products, or if our customer or respondent data are compromised, users may curtail or stop use of our survey platform.


Our products collect, process, store, share, disclose and use customers’ and respondents’ information and communications, some of which may be private. We also work with third-party vendors to process credit card payments by our customers and are thus subject to payment card association operating rules, and rely on the availability and certain security measures of our third-party payment processors. We also process and retain sensitive information and other data relating to our business, such as employees’ personal information and our confidential information. We anticipate continuing to expend significant amounts in an effort to reduce the risk of security breaches and other security incidents. We are vulnerable to software bugs, computer viruses, break-ins, ransomware or phishing attacks, employee errors or malfeasance, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or confidential information. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate the risk of breaches of our survey platform or other security incidents affecting our products, internal systems, networks or data. In addition, the functionality of our products may be disrupted by third parties, including disgruntled employees, former employees or contractors. The security measures we use internally, and have integrated into our products, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to protect against certain attacks. Additionally, we may face delays in identifying or responding to security breaches or other security incidents. With the increase in personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, we and our service providers are at increased risk for security breaches. We are taking steps to monitor and enhance the security of our platform, systems, IT infrastructure, networks, and data; however, the unprecedented scale of remote work may require additional personnel and resources, which nevertheless cannot be guaranteed to fully safeguard our platform or any systems, IT infrastructure, networks, or data upon which we rely. If we or any of our vendors experience or are believed to have experienced any compromises to security that result in site performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites or the actual or perceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, such as credit card information, personal health information, trade secrets or other proprietary information, our users may be harmed or lose trust and confidence in us and choose to decrease the use of our products, which would cause us to suffer reputational and financial harm.
An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents can originate on our vendors’ websites, which can then be leveraged to access our website, further preventing our ability to successfully identify and mitigate the attack. For example, in December 2021, the Apache Software Foundation publicly disclosed a remote code execution vulnerability in its Log4j2 product, an open-source component widely used in Java-based software applications to log and track error messages, that resulted in potential opportunities for unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or confidential information, installation of malware, or unauthorized control of the target's system. To date, we have not detected any successful exploit attempts on our systems, and this incident has not resulted in a material loss of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We are actively monitoring the situation and have established an inventory of all applications and systems running Log4j, and patched, upgraded, or configured them to prevent and detect any malicious activity related to the vulnerability. We are also working closely with third parties and vendors to ensure that they are addressing this vulnerability. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and remediated and we expect the risk of additional vulnerabilities and potential attacks to continue given the complexity and widespread nature of the incident. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover costs and liabilities related to this incident.
 In addition, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation in connection with a security breach or related issues, and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches. Such litigation, regulatory investigations and our technical activities intended to prevent future security breaches are likely to require additional management resources and expenditures. If our security measures fail to protect this information adequately or we fail to comply with other rules and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (“CCPA”), the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Principles or applicable credit card association operating rules, we could be liable to both our users for their losses, as well as the vendors under our agreements with them, we could be subject to fines and

higher transaction fees, we could face regulatory action, and our users and vendors could end their relationships with us, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our internal systems are exposed to the same cybersecurity risks and consequences of a breach as our customers and other enterprises. However, since our business is focused on providing reliably secure products to our customers, we believe that an actual or perceived breach of, or security incident affecting, our internal networks, systems or data could be especially detrimental to our reputation, customer confidence in our products and solutions and our business.
 While our insurance policies include liability coverage for certain of these matters, if we experienced a widespread security breach or other incident that impacted a significant number of our customers to whom we owe indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims or other damages that exceed our insurance coverage. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.
 Our products and solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.
 Our products and solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of our software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within our software may result in a negative experience for our users, delay product introductions or enhancements or result in measurement or other errors. We also rely on third-party software that may contain errors or bugs. Any actual or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, bugs or defects discovered in our software or third-party software we use could result in damage to our reputation, cause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our products, require us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages, cause us to lose existing users or make it more difficult to attract new users, divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our survey platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The costs incurred in correcting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the harm to our reputation and legal liability related to such errors or defects may be substantial and could harm our business.
 We depend on third-party data centers and any disruption in the operation of these facilities or failure to renew the services could impair the delivery of our products and solutions and adversely affect our business.
 We currently deploy our products and solutions and serve all of our users using third-party data center services such as Amazon Web Services. We have no physical access or control over the services provided by Amazon Web Services. Consequently, we may be subject to misconduct or unauthorized data access by such third-party service providers or service disruptions, including those that are directly or indirectly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as failures to provide adequate services for reasons that are outside our direct control.
Data center leases and agreements with the providers of data center services expire at various times. The owners of these data centers and providers of these data center services may have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Problems faced by data centers, with our third-party data center service providers, with the telecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their users, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our users. Our third-party data center operators could decide to close their facilities or cease providing services without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by our third-party data centers operators or any of the service providers with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. In addition, these facilities may be located in areas prone to natural disasters, the effects of climate change and pandemics, and may experience events such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar

misconduct. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally, or those of the third-party providers, could result in interruptions in use of our products that may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their services with us and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers.
If the data centers and service providers that we use are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, or if we are unable to renew our agreements with data centers and service providers on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer servers or content to new data centers or engage new service providers, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, if we do not accurately plan for our data center capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, we may experience delays and additional expenses in arranging new data centers, and our users could experience service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. Any changes in third-party service levels at data centers or any real or perceived errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our products and solutions could harm our reputation and may result in damage to, or loss or compromise of, our users’ content. Interruptions in our products and solutions might, among other things, reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to users, subject us to potential liability, harm our reputation or our ability to retain customers.
 
Risks Related to Financial or Operating Results
 Our business, results of operations and financial condition may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in a decline in our stock price if such fluctuations result in a failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.
 Our operating results have in the past and could in the future vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Any of these events could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include:
•our ability to attract new users to our survey platform; 
 •our ability to convert users of our free basic survey product to paying users; 
 •our ability to retain paying users;
 •our ability to prevent account sharing and software piracy;
 •our ability to maintain and improve our products; 
 •shifts in the way customers, respondents and users access our websites and products from personal computers to mobile devices;
 •the effectiveness of our rebranding, which launched in June 2021; 
 •the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, including old strategies that may cease to be effective and the failure of new efforts; 
 •disruptions or outages in the availability of our websites or products, actual or perceived breaches of privacy and compromises of our customer or respondent data; 
 •changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; 
 •our ability to increase sales of our products and solutions to new customers and expand sales of additional products and solutions to our existing customers; 
 •the size and seasonal variability of our customers’ research and marketing and budgets; 
 •the extent to which existing customers renew their agreements with us and the timing and terms of those renewals; 
 •our ability to successfully implement any restructuring of our operations;
 •general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, an economic downturn or recession, and war; 
 •the timing and cost of investing in our technology infrastructure, product initiatives, facilities and international expansion may be greater than we anticipate;


•our needs related to facilities and data centers may change over time and vary from our original forecasts, and the value of the property that we lease or own may fluctuate; 
 •expenses related to hiring, incentivizing and retaining employees; 
 •the timing and costs associated with investing in our sales organization and delays or inability in achieving expected productivity; 
 •the timing of certain expenditures, including capital expenditures; 
 •the entrance of new competitors in our market whether by established companies or the entrance of new companies; 
 •currency exchange rate fluctuations; 
 •our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the expected benefit of such acquisitions in a timely manner or at all; 
 •changes in the price of our subscription plans; and 
 •changing tax laws and regulations. 
 Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future operating results. In addition, global economic concerns, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, general economic uncertainty and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability and add risk to our future outlook. An economic downturn in any particular region in which we do business or globally could result in reductions in sales of our products, decreased renewals of existing arrangements and other adverse effects that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Relevant regulators ceased the calculation and publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021, and all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease after June 30, 2023. Although our existing credit facilities provide for application of successor rates based on prevailing market conditions, the transition from LIBOR to any alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), could be complex and as a result, our future interest obligations may increase and adversely impact our results of operations.
 We have substantial indebtedness and lease obligations, which reduce our capability to withstand adverse developments or business conditions.
 We have incurred substantial indebtedness, and as of December 31, 2022, our total aggregate indebtedness was approximately $185.7 million of principal outstanding. We also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of December 31, 2022, our total aggregate obligations under our long-term leases was $58.7 million. Our payments on our outstanding indebtedness and lease obligations are significant in relation to our revenue and cash flow, which exposes us to significant risk in the event of downturns in our businesses (whether through competitive pressures or otherwise), our industry or the economy generally, including the global economic uncertainties and downturns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, since our cash flows would decrease but our required payments under our indebtedness and lease obligations would not. Economic downturns may impact our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our credit facilities and agreements governing our other indebtedness and lease obligations and may impact our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness or lease obligations as they come due, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could also:
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations under our outstanding indebtedness; 
 •limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions; 
 •limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; 
 •limit our ability to adapt to changing market conditions;
 •limit our ability to execute our share repurchase program;
 •restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures; 
 •require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to paying the principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other corporate purposes; 


•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry generally; and 
 •place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have a less significant debt burden. 
 We may be required to delay recognition of some of our revenue, which may harm our financial results in any given period.
 We may be required to delay recognition of revenue for a significant period of time after entering into an agreement due to a variety of factors, including, among other things, whether:
•the transaction involves both current products and products that are under development; 
 •the customer requires significant modifications, configurations or complex interfaces that could delay delivery or acceptance of our products; 
 •the transaction involves acceptance criteria or other terms that may delay revenue recognition; or 
 •the transaction involves performance milestones or payment terms that depend upon contingencies. 
 Because of these factors and other specific revenue recognition requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we must have very precise terms in our contracts to recognize revenue when we initially provide access to our survey platform or other products. Although we strive to enter into agreements that meet the criteria under GAAP for current revenue recognition on delivered performance obligations, our agreements are often subject to negotiation and revision based on the demands of our customers. The final terms of our agreements sometimes result in delayed revenue recognition, which may adversely affect our financial results in any given period. In addition, more customers may require extended payment terms, shorter term contracts or alternative licensing arrangements that could reduce the amount of revenue we recognize upon delivery of our other products and could adversely affect our short-term financial results.
Furthermore, the presentation of our financial results requires us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect revenue recognition. In some instances, we could reasonably use different estimates and assumptions, and changes in estimates are likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
Our results of operations may not immediately reflect downturns or upturns in sales because we recognize revenue from our users over the term of their paid subscriptions with us.
 We recognize revenue from paid subscriptions to our products and solutions over the terms of the subscription period. Paying users can choose between monthly or annual subscriptions, and customers of SurveyMonkey Enterprise make a minimum one-year subscription commitment and are increasingly purchasing multi-year subscriptions. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. As a result, a large portion of our revenue for each quarter reflects deferred revenue from paid subscriptions entered into during previous quarters, and downturns or upturns in subscription sales, or renewals and potential changes in our pricing policies may not be reflected in our results of operations until later periods. Our paid subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as paid subscription revenue from new users is recognized over the applicable subscription term.


If we fail to effectively manage our growth and evolution, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
 The scope and complexity of our business have also increased significantly. The evolution of our business creates significant challenges for our management, operational and financial resources. In the event of continued expansion of our operations or in the number of our third-party relationships, our information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. To effectively manage our development and evolution, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management processes and systems and to train and manage our employee base, and expand as needed, and do so in a hybrid work environment where some of our employees are working in the office and others are working remotely. This hybrid work model may present operational challenges and risks, including negative employee morale and productivity, low employee retention, and increased compliance and tax obligations in a number of jurisdictions. As our organization continues to evolve and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products and solutions. This could negatively affect our business performance.
Changes in growth in our headcount and operations will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As of December 31, 2022, 24% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and 26% for more than one year but less than two years. As we continue to grow and evolve, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate our current employees and new employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. We face significant competition for talent from other internet, software and high-growth companies, which include both publicly traded and privately-held companies. The risks of over-compensating employees and the challenges of integrating a growing employee base into our corporate culture are exacerbated by our international expansion. Additionally, during periods of growth, we expanded our operating and financing lease obligations and purchase commitments, which have increased our expenses. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs, successfully integrate our new hires and retain current employees in a hybrid work environment, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the development and evolution of our business and operations, including the implementation of restructuring initiatives, the quality of our products and solutions could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand, results of operations and overall business. Actions we have taken (including the implementation of restructuring plans) or that we may decide to take in the future in our attempt to achieve profitability, may not be successful in yielding our intended results and may not appropriately address either or both of the short-term and long-term strategy of our business. Implementation of a go-forward plan and any other cost-saving initiatives, including possible future restructuring efforts, may be costly and disruptive to our business, have adverse impacts on employee morale and retention, result in expected costs and charges that are greater than forecasted, and result in estimated cost savings that are lower than forecasted. Further, we have made changes in the past, and will likely make changes in the future, to our products that our customers may not like, find useful or agree with. We may also decide to discontinue certain features, products or solutions or charge for certain features, products or solutions that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features, products or solutions. If users are unhappy with these changes, they may decrease their usage of our products or stop using them generally, and in the past we have experienced a decrease in our number of paying users as a result of pricing changes. In addition, they may choose to take other types of action against us, such as organizing petitions or boycotts focused on our company, our website or our products and services, filing claims with the government or other regulatory bodies or filing lawsuits against us. Any of these actions could negatively impact our growth and brand, which would harm our business.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our operating results or financial position.
 We conduct our business around the world and a significant portion of our transactions outside of the United States are denominated in foreign currencies. As we continue to invest in our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation

and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and accept payment from customers in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we have faced, and may face in the future, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and remeasurement exposure, and any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies could cause our revenue to decline relative to our costs, which could lead to a decrease in our operating margins. Exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability and hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings. For example, because we recognize revenue over time, exchange rate fluctuations at one point in time may have a negative impact in future quarters. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our exposure to currency exchange rate risks, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any material amount of derivative financial instruments.
Strategic investments in international markets is important for our growth, and as we continue to invest internationally, we will face additional business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks, any of which could increase our costs and hinder such growth.
 Continuing to invest in our business to attract users in countries other than the United States is a critical element of our business strategy. An important part of targeting international markets is increasing our brand awareness and developing offerings that are localized and customized for the users in those markets. We have a limited operating history as a company outside of the United States. We expect to continue to strategically invest resources to our international expansion efforts through acquisitions and partnerships, the establishment of additional offices and increasing our foreign language offerings. Our ability to grow our business and to attract talented employees and users in an increasing number of international markets will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. Expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including but not limited to risks associated with recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries; challenges caused by distance, time zone, language and cultural differences; developing and customizing products and solutions that appeal to the tastes and preferences of users in international markets; competition from local survey providers with significant market share in those markets and with a better understanding of user preferences; reliance on third parties and partnerships to provide product support and services that we do not resource directly outside of the United States, such as panelists for our SurveyMonkey Audience solution; protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights; the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content or technology into new jurisdictions; compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including privacy and data protection laws and laws relating to content; credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud; currency exchange rate fluctuations; protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in some countries; foreign tax consequences; foreign exchange controls or U.S. tax restrictions that might restrict or prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside of the United States; political, economic and social instability (including Russia's invasion of Ukraine); higher costs associated with doing business internationally; export or import regulations; and trade and tariff restrictions.
Entering new international markets will be expensive, our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular market is uncertain and the distraction of our senior management team could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of software products.
 We derive, and expect to continue to derive, a substantial majority of our revenue from our paid individual and enterprise subscription offerings to our survey platform. As such, the market acceptance of our survey platform is critical to our success. Demand for subscription access to our survey platform and for our other products and solutions is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued market acceptance of our survey platform by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products, solutions, features and functionality that are lower cost alternatives introduced by us or our competitors, technological changes and developments within the markets we serve, growth or contraction in our addressable markets, and general macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of a general slowdown in the

global economy and inflationary pressures. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our survey platform, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
 
Risks Related to Regulatory and Tax Compliance
 We collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
 We collect, process, store, share, disclose and use information from and about our customers, respondents, users, sales leads and prospects, including personal information and other data. There are numerous laws around the world regarding privacy, data protection and security, including laws regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal information and other data from and about our customers, respondents, users, sales leads and prospects. The scope of these laws is changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.
We strive to comply with applicable laws, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and security and are subject to the terms of our privacy notices and privacy-related obligations to third parties. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways and/or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Data privacy, data protection and security are active areas, and new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy or data protection policies, our privacy- or data protection-related obligations to customers, respondents, users or other third parties, our data disclosure and consent obligations or our privacy-, data protection- or security-related legal and regulatory obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized disclosure, transfer or use of personal or other information, which may include personally identifiable information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements critical of us by consumer advocacy groups, competitors, the media or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as customers, partners, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws, our policies or other privacy-, data protection- or security-related obligations, such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Governmental agencies may also request or take user or customer data for national security or informational purposes, and can also make data requests in connection with criminal or civil investigations or other matters, which could harm our reputation and our business or be in contravention of our contractual obligations. Additionally, our compliance with the laws of one jurisdiction may be in contravention to laws or regulations that we are subject to in other jurisdictions.
In addition, there has been increased uncertainty around the legality of various mechanisms for personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries outside the European Union, which may have a significant impact on the transfer of data from the European Union to companies in the United States or other jurisdictions, including us. For example, we may have to require some of our vendors who process personal data to take on additional privacy, data protection and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. We may also have to substantially reorganize our infrastructure to meet local requirements regarding data storage, access and transfer which also has the potential to adversely impact our business and cause significant additional expense. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our users and customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States, we could be subject to orders to suspend our services, enforcement actions or investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, Attorney General of California or other states, individual EU Data Protection Authorities or lawsuits by private parties, use of our products could decline and our business could be negatively impacted. There is also uncertainty as to whether certain legal mechanisms for the lawful transfer of data from the European Union to the United States or other jurisdictions will withstand legal challenges, and such legal mechanisms may be modified or replaced. If the mechanisms on which we rely for the transfer of data are found to be invalid or are modified or replaced, our business would be substantially impacted, as key agreements may need to be renegotiated, customers may lose confidence in our ability to transfer data legally from the European Union to the United States or other jurisdictions and we may be subject to orders to suspend our services, enforcement actions or investigations by the Federal Trade

Commission, Attorney General of California or other states, or EU Data Protection Authorities or other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.
Public scrutiny of internet privacy and security issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could deter or prevent us from providing our products to our customers, thereby harming our business.
 The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is evolving and is likely to remain in flux for the foreseeable future. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. Practices regarding the registration, collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal and other information by companies offering an online service like our survey platform and other solutions have recently come under increased public scrutiny.
For example, the European Union has enacted the GDPR, which became effective in May 2018 and the State of California has enacted the CCPA which became effective on January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act 2020 (“CPRA”) was also passed in November 2020 and became effective on January 1, 2023. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Additionally, the current data protection legislation in the United Kingdom substantially mirrors the GDPR, but there is uncertainty with regard to how the United Kingdom data protection regime will evolve now that it has left the European Union. These laws require greater compliance efforts for companies with users or operations in the European Union, United Kingdom and/or California and provides for fines of: in the case of the GDPR, up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of global annual revenue for noncompliance; or in the case of the CCPA, up to $2,500 per violation or $7,500 for each intentional violation, as well as a private right of action for certain failures to implement and maintain reasonable security measures.
In the United States, the federal government and many state governments have reviewed and are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data from mobile devices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or guidelines. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to disclosure of companies’ practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from internet browsers, the ability to delete information of minors and new data breach notification requirements. California has also adopted privacy guidelines with respect to mobile applications and in 2018 enacted the CCPA. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and affords such consumers rights to access and delete personal information and new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, among other things. The CCPA became enforceable on July 1, 2020. Laws similar to the CCPA have also been proposed in other states, and some states, including Nevada, Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have implemented laws imposing obligations similar to the CCPA. Additionally, the CPRA, as currently drafted, would significantly modify the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses. We cannot yet predict the full impact of the CCPA, CPRA, or other similar laws or regulations on our business or operations, but they may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020 with a transition period through December 31, 2021. Certain risks continue to exist depending on the outcomes of any re-negotiation of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. A Data Protection Act has been enacted that substantially implements GDPR, which became law in May 2018. It remains unclear, however, how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations and enforcement strategies will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Union and the United Kingdom have reached agreement on transfers of personal data between the regions which provides that the United Kingdom has adequate measures in place to protect data subjects, however, future changes to UK privacy laws could place this adequacy in jeopardy and there is some uncertainty about the sustainability of that agreement. The United Kingdom has also introduced its own contractual data transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data to other regions outside the United Kingdom (the “IDTA”). The effectiveness of this new contractual data transfer mechanism has not been legally tested as yet and accordingly, there is still uncertainty about the legality of personal data transfers to some jurisdictions utilizing the new IDTA and in general, UK customers continue to favor data storage in the United Kingdom or European Union.


Additionally, we historically have participated in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and a related program, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, and made use of certain model clauses approved by the European Commission (the “SCCs”), with regard to certain transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the United States. Both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and SCCs have been subject to legal challenge, however, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on the SCCs. On September 8, 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner also issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. These decisions are resulting in European data protection regulators applying differing standards for, and requiring ad hoc verification of, transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. This results in those transfers being deemed unlawful. We may be required to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers impacted by these developments and be subject to increasing costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. We have analyzed the impact of the decisions, applicable guidance, recommendations, updated SCCs and new IDTA and have implemented a program for compliance. Because the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, along with industry standards, are uncertain, it is possible that relevant laws, regulations, or standards may be interpreted and applied in manners that are, or are alleged to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products. We may find it necessary or appropriate to take different or additional steps with respect to transfers of personal data, which may result in significant increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective customers in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the “impacted jurisdictions”) to use our survey platform or other solutions, and we and our customers may face a risk of orders to suspend our services or enforcement actions by data protection authorities in these impacted jurisdictions or other countries relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from these locations. Any such actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
 Outside the European Union and the United States, a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations, including laws and regulations requiring local storage and processing of data, that may result in greater compliance efforts. In addition, government agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to review the personal data practices of certain online companies. If we are unable to comply with any such reviews or decrees that result in recommendations or binding changes, or if the recommended changes result in degradation of our products, our business could be harmed.
Our business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our websites, mobile applications, survey platform, solutions, features or our privacy policies. In particular, the success of our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by our ability to responsibly gather and use data from data subjects and help our customers collect and analyze data from survey respondents. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the storage, use or disclosure of data our customers or respondents share with us, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such collection, analysis and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our survey platform, features and other products, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, solutions and features that make use of the data that we collect.
Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
 We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages (and related traffic data where applicable), human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, intellectual property and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws and tax regulations, which are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations that are or may be applicable to us, our vendors or partners or certain groups of

our users are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws and other obligations outside of the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the advertisements posted or the content provided by users.
 In addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, spam, data storage, data protection, local storage or processing of data, content regulation, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, intellectual property infringement, consumer rights, government access to personal information and other matters that may be applicable to our business. For example, the European Union has recently been developing new requirements related to the use of data, artificial intelligence, and consumer protection, including the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the Data Governance Act, the Data Act, the Artificial Intelligence Act, and the Omnibus Directive. These new regulations will add additional rules and restrictions on the use of data in our products and services and may reduce demand for and sales of our offerings, which would adversely impact our financial results. In addition, compliance with these laws may require substantial investment, provide technical challenges for our business, or divert engineering resources from other projects. More countries are enacting and enforcing laws related to the appropriateness of content and enforcing those and other laws by blocking access to services that are found to be out of compliance. It is also likely that as our business grows, evolves and an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile and our solutions are used in a greater number of countries and additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. Users of our site and our solutions could also abuse or misuse our survey platform and other products in ways that violate laws or cause damage to our business. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and whether we will become subject to new laws or legal obligations that will impact our business.
If we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations, or if we or our vendors or users become liable under these laws or legal obligations, or if our products or services are suspended or blocked, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions, which would negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could also be subject to investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions, mandatory changes to our products and solutions, disgorgement of profits, fines and damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, claims for damages, termination of contracts and loss of intellectual property rights. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate such laws and regulations.
 We are subject to U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we take precautions to prevent our products and services from being exported or used in violation of these laws, including implementing IP address blocking, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions regulations. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us.
 For example, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States and other countries imposed economic sanctions and severe export control restrictions against Russia and Belarus and could impose wider sanctions and export restrictions and take other actions should the conflict continue to escalate. While we currently do not have any significant exposure, any exports or sales of our software or services into Russia and Belarus may be impacted by these restrictions. Monitoring and ensuring compliance with these complex U.S. export control laws is particularly challenging because our offerings are widely distributed throughout the world. Even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our partners comply with all relevant export control laws and regulations, any failure by us or our partners to comply with such laws and regulations could have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.
 In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our users’ ability to access our survey platform in those countries. Changes in

our products, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our users with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our products to, existing or potential users with international operations. Any decreased use of our survey platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
 We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or gain any advantage. The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and similar applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also prohibit our third-party business partners, representatives and agents from engaging in corruption and bribery. We may be held liable for the acts of recently acquired companies, our third-party business partners, representatives and agents. To that end, in addition to our own salesforce, we leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party business partners, representatives and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, drop in stock price or overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of our management.
 We derive a portion of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States and we have significant operations outside of the United States, including engineering, sales and customer support. We plan to strategically invest in our international operations, but such investment is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities.
Our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those our domestic operations face, including:
•potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or that may not be adequately enforced; 
 •requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including laws related to privacy, data protection and transfer, trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations; 
 •local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations; 
 •restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the United States; 


•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and inflationary pressures could reduce our customers’ ability to obtain financing for software products and solutions or that could make our survey platform and solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries; 
 •limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenue from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations, or execute properly on such investments;
 •difficulties in staffing, managing and operating our international operations, including difficulties related to administering our equity incentive plan in some foreign countries; 
 •difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations; 
 •seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in Europe and in other periods in other countries; 
 •costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages; and 
 •political unrest, war (including Russia's invasion of Ukraine) or terrorism, or regional natural disasters, effects of climate change or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), particularly in areas in which we have facilities. 
 The level of corporate tax from sales to our non-U.S. customers is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the U.S and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.
The intended tax efficiency of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depends on the interpretation and application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business; changes to our effective tax rate could adversely impact our results.
 Our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are intended to optimize business efficiency as well as reduce our worldwide effective tax rate. The tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, are subject to change, and their application to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing on intercompany arrangements, or they may make a determination that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences. This could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several other factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as: increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, the tax effects of restructuring charges or purchase accounting for acquisitions, increases in withholding taxes, changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax assets, including those related to other-than-temporary impairment, and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Further, we periodically undergo review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and expect such actions to continue in the future. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies in jurisdictions outside of the United States could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 Changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate. For example, in August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which imposes a 15% minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. This act, as well as any other changes to tax laws that are enacted, could adversely affect our tax liability. The same is true for changes to tax laws in the other countries in which we operate. Due to the expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or international taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our operating results may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes on subscriptions to our products in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.
 We collect sales, use, value-added and other transaction taxes as part of our subscription agreements in a number of jurisdictions. One or more states or countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, value added or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us or our resellers and other partners. A successful assertion by a state, country or other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes on our products could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities, discourage users from utilizing our products or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.
We have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our reincorporation. We incurred net losses of approximately $89.9 million, $123.2 million and $91.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $707.4 million as of December 31, 2022. These losses reflect, among other things, significant investments we made to grow our business, particularly to scale our business. We expect to continue to make future investments and expenditures related to the growth of our business, including strategic investments in our sales and marketing activities, hiring employees necessary to meet our needs, investments in technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy the needs of our user base, and continued investments in research and development to support these efforts. In addition, we will continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support both our growth as well as our operations as a publicly traded company. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. We may encounter unforeseen or unpredictable factors, including unforeseen operating expenses, complications or delays, which may result in increased costs. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, user demand for our survey platform, the entry of competitive survey platforms or other products or the success of existing competitive products and solutions. As a result, we may not achieve or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had $353.1 million of federal and $215.7 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will expire during 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had federal research and development credits of $27.5 million which will begin to expire in 2034; state research and development credits of $23.6 million which will carryforward indefinitely; and foreign research and development credits of $2.1 million which will begin to expire in 2039. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Based on analysis performed, we have concluded that approximately $45.1 million of net operating loss carryforwards from companies we have previously acquired are subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code. At this time, for our non-acquired net operating losses, we have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our formation. We may have experienced various ownership changes, as defined by the Code, as a result of past financing transactions (or other activities), and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. Accordingly, our ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited.
 
General Risks
If internet search engines’ methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, use and engagement by users could decline.
 We depend in part on various internet search engines to direct a significant portion of our traffic to our websites. Similarly, we depend on providers of mobile application “store fronts” to allow users to locate and download our mobile applications that enable our product. Our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our websites

and users of our survey platform is not entirely within our control. Our competitors’ search engine optimization (“SEO”) efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search engine results page ranking than ours, or internet search engines could revise their methodologies in an attempt to improve their search results, which could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our new user growth or in ways that make it harder for our users to use our website, if we fail to successfully manage changes in SEO and social media traffic or if our competitors’ SEO efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow, user engagement could decrease and we could lose existing users. These modifications may be prompted by search engine companies entering the online survey market or aligning with competitors. Additionally, our competitors may adopt search engine marketing tactics such as bidding on our terms in order to drive up our costs. This could make it more expensive to acquire new customers using our current marketing methods. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search engine results page rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet and mobile networks by us and our users on personal computers and mobile devices.
 Our survey platform and solutions depend on the ability of our customers, respondents and users to access our products through their personal computers and mobile devices. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers, any of whom could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to our products, which would, in turn, negatively impact our business. In addition, internet or network access could be disrupted by other third parties. Further, the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet and mobile networks, including laws limiting internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our paid subscription offerings or the usage of our survey platform and increase our cost of doing business.
If we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.
 Our customers and respondents are increasingly accessing our products on mobile devices. We are devoting valuable resources to solutions related to monetization of mobile usage, and cannot assure you that these solutions will be successful. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet the needs of current prospective customers or respondents, or if our solutions are difficult to access, they may reduce their usage of our products or cease using our products altogether and our business could suffer. Additionally, we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control, such as Android and iOS operating systems, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions’ functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect traffic and monetization on mobile devices. We may not be successful in maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products may not work or be easily accessible or viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices, or we may have difficulty preparing or loading our applications in app stores. As new devices and products are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices. If we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our solutions on mobile devices, or if these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected.
If we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our solutions on mobile devices, or these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected.
 Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and results of operations.
 We regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, databases, domain names and patents as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights and other rights provided under foreign laws. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the existing laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the

laws of the United States. We also have a practice of entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and often enter into confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. In addition, from time to time we make our technology available to others under license agreements, including open source license agreements. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information, infringement of our intellectual property rights or deter independent development of similar or competing technologies by others and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such misappropriation or infringement.
We believe it is important to maintain, protect and enhance our brands. Obtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property rights is expensive, including the costs of defending our rights. We are seeking to protect certain of our intellectual property rights through filing applications for copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents and domain names in the United States and many locations outside of the United States, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in all jurisdictions. Even where we have such rights, they may later be found to be unenforceable or have a limited scope of enforceability. In addition, we may not seek to pursue such protection in every location. We have already and may, over time, increase our investment in protecting innovations through investments in patents and similar rights, and this process is expensive and time-consuming.
Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our proprietary rights or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may also incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our “Momentive” and “SurveyMonkey” brands and other valuable trademarks and service marks.
In addition, we have chosen to make certain of our technology available under open source licenses that allow others to use the technology without payment to us. While we hope to benefit from these activities by having access to others’ useful technology under open source licenses, there is no assurance that we will receive the business benefits we expect.
If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.
We have relationships with third parties to provide, develop and create applications that integrate with our products, and our business could be harmed if we are not able to continue these relationships.
 We use software and services licensed and procured from third parties to develop and offer our survey platform and other products. We may need to obtain future licenses and services from third parties to use intellectual property and technology associated with the development of our products, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software or services required for the development and maintenance of our products could result in delays in the provision of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from others, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party software or services could result in errors or a failure of our products, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We also depend on our ecosystem of developers to create applications that will integrate with our survey platform. We offer prebuilt integrations, data portability and single sign-on identity with applications, such as those offered by Salesforce, Marketo, Tableau, Microsoft, and Oracle, as well as open APIs and configurable integrations. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their survey platform, or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our survey platform. Our reliance on this ecosystem of developers creates certain business risks relating to the quality of the applications built using our application programming interface, including product interruptions of our survey platform from these applications, lack of product support for these applications, our reputation being harmed if the applications do not function as intended and possession of intellectual property rights associated with these applications. We may not have the ability to control or prevent these risks. As a result, issues relating to these applications could adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our products or increased revenue.
Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to our products and subject us to possible litigation.
 A portion of the technologies we use incorporates open source software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. These licenses may require us to offer our products that incorporate such open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of open source software or patents related to that software, rights to our intellectual property or breach of open source license terms, including a demand for release of material portions of our source code or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation, which could be costly to defend, require us to purchase a costly license, require us to establish additional specific open source compliance procedures, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to remove open source elements from or otherwise change our solutions, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, if we were to combine our own software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of some software that would be valuable to keep as a trade secret and/or not make available for use by others. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property and privacy disputes, which are costly to defend and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
 We may be party to lawsuits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. These matters are often expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. We may face allegations, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, audits and investigations regarding data privacy, security, labor and employment, consumer protection and intellectual property infringement, including claims related to privacy, patents, publicity, trademarks, copyrights and other rights. We may also face allegations, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, audits and investigations related to our acquisitions, securities issuances or our business practices, including public disclosures about our business. Litigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the patent infringement and class action matters we could face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages and include claims for injunctive relief. Additionally, our litigation costs could be significant. Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products or require us to stop offering certain features, all of which could negatively impact our user and revenue growth. We may also become subject to periodic audits, which would likely increase our regulatory compliance costs and may require us to change our business practices, which could negatively impact our revenue growth. Managing legal proceedings, litigation and audits, even if we achieve favorable outcomes, is time-consuming and diverts management’s attention from our business.
The results of regulatory proceedings, litigation, claims and audits cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal, regulatory and audit matters requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and the market price of our common stock.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic instability and global uncertainty, and the extent to which it will impact our business and results of operations is uncertain and difficult to predict.
 The severity and spread of new or existing variants of the COVID-19 virus and changes in infection rates may impact the health and productivity of our workforce and may disrupt the operations of our customers, partners and other

third-party providers for an indefinite period of time. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a hybrid work environment where most of our employees have the flexibility to determine the amount of time they work from home and in our offices. We will continue to evaluate and refine our hybrid workforce and real estate needs. It is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
 Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events and man-made problems, such as power disruptions, data security breaches, war and terrorism.
Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from the occurrence of any catastrophic event, which could be exacerbated by climate change, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunction, cyberattack, war, terrorist attack, incident of mass violence or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), which could result in lengthy interruptions in the use of our products. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and certain of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and that has experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing rate, including drought and water scarcity, warmer temperatures, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shut-offs associated with wildfire prevention, and our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake, wildfire or other significant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism, including malicious internet-based activity, could cause disruptions to the Internet or the economy as a whole. Our disaster recovery plan may not be sufficient to address all aspects or any unanticipated consequence or incident, and use of our products could be interrupted. If our systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster, climate change, pandemic, or other event, our ability to deliver products and solutions to our users would be impaired or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster, and successfully execute on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation would be harmed.
We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition that may result from interruptions in our product use as a result of system failures.
Our operations are subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation.
 The United States has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States was approximately 6.5% for 2022. If the inflation rate continues to increase, such as increases in the costs of labor, it will likely affect all of our expenses, especially employee compensation expenses. Additionally, the United States is experiencing an acute workforce shortage, which in turn, has created a hyper-competitive wage environment that may increase our operating costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market, it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
 We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
 We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features, products and solutions, or enhance our existing survey platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we have engaged and may continue to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.

Acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We have acquired a number of companies in the past and may make additional acquisitions in the future to add employees, complementary companies, products, solutions, technologies or revenue. Future acquisitions could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates and negotiations of these transactions can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:
•loss of key employees of the acquired company and other challenges associated with integrating new employees into our culture, as well as reputational harm if integration is not successful; 
 •diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges; 
 •implementation or remediation of controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; 
 •integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing function; 
 •assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability; 
 •failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology or realize our intended business strategy; 
 •failure to find commercial success with the products or services of the acquired company; 
 •difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing survey platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other products and solutions; 
 •failure to successfully onboard customers or maintain brand quality of acquired companies; 
 •liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; 
 •failure to generate the expected financial results related to an acquisition on a timely manner or at all; and 
 •failure to accurately forecast the impact of an acquisition transaction. 
 These risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and adversely affect our business generally.
Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers, partners or investors.
If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements include those related to deferred commissions, stock-based compensation, business combination valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets, and incremental borrowing rate for leases. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.


The tracking of certain of our user metrics is done with internal tools and is not independently verified. Certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
 We track certain user metrics with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third party. Our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our user metrics, including the metrics we report. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. For example, we track the number of individual users and organizational domains but cannot determine the number of unique users or unique organizations in which we have paying customers with certainty, and our inability to determine the number of our unique users and unique organizations in which we have paying customers may adversely affect our understanding of certain aspects of our business and make it more challenging to manage our business. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer-term strategies. Additionally, regulatory changes could affect requirements related to data we track related to our metrics, and those changes could impact how we continue to measure and compare data over time. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, causing our stock price to decline.
Certain of our growth expectations and key business metrics included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could prove to be inaccurate, and any real or perceived inaccuracies may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.
 Growth expectations are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. We also rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key business metrics, such as paying users. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our key business metrics to improve their accuracy. Our key business metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. If investors or analysts do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our controls.
Our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or fail to meet the demands that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. If any material weaknesses exist or are discovered and we are unable to

remediate any such material weakness, our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.
 Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
 Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies any of which could negatively affect our results of operations.
Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to liability for intellectual property infringement, data protection and other losses.
 Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, privacy, data protection or information security issues, damages caused by us to property or persons or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products or other contractual obligations. Some of these indemnity agreements provide for uncapped liability for which we would be responsible, and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them and we may be required to cease use of certain functions of our products as a result of any such claims. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Debt
 The trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially depending on a number of factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause continuing fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:
•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; 
 •announcements of new products, solutions or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors; 
 •changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our products and future offerings; 
 •departures of key personnel; 


•reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, as well as reaction to third-party reports regarding our business, markets and the industry in which we operate; 
 •fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float; 
 •trading activity under our share repurchase program;
 •sales of large blocks of our common stock; 
 •actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; 
 •whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors; 
 •changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts; 
 •actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our products or website; 
 •litigation involving us, our industry or both; 
 •governmental or regulatory actions or audits; 
 •regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both; 
 •general economic conditions and trends, including the effects of a general slowdown in the global economy, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, trade conflicts or the imposition of tariffs; 
 •major catastrophic events (including Russia's invasion of Ukraine) or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) in our domestic and foreign markets; and 
 •“flash crashes,” “freeze flashes” or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed. 
 In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Shares of our common stock are subordinate in right of payment to our debts and other liabilities, resulting in a greater risk of loss for stockholders.
Shares of our common stock are subordinate in right of payment to all of our current and future debt. We cannot assure that there would be any remaining funds after the payment of all of our debts for any distribution to holders of the common stock.
 Our debt service requirements and restrictive covenants limit our ability to borrow more money, to make distributions to our stockholders and to engage in other activities.
Our existing credit agreement, as amended, contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, transfer or dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions, incur additional indebtedness, repurchase shares of common stock, create liens, make investments, loans and acquisitions, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets. Our credit agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower subsidiary, us and the guarantor subsidiaries. The terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies, including our share repurchase program. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. Additionally, our obligations to repay principal and interest on our indebtedness make us vulnerable to economic or market downturns.
If we are unable to comply with our payment requirements, our lenders may accelerate our obligations under our credit agreement and foreclose upon the collateral, or we may be forced to sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital, which would dilute our stockholders’ interests. If we fail to comply with any covenant or if we are subject to a change in control, it could result in an event of default under the agreement and the lenders (or any subsequent lender) could make the entire debt immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we

might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. These events could cause us to cease operations.
Our failure to comply with our credit agreement and other indebtedness could require us to abandon our business.
Our indebtedness increases the risk that we will not be able to operate profitably because we will need to make principal and interest payments on our debt. Debt financing also exposes our stockholders to the risk that their holdings could be lost in the event of a default on the indebtedness and a foreclosure and sale of our assets for an amount that is less than the outstanding debt. Our ability to obtain additional debt financing, if required, will be subject to approval of our lenders, which may not be granted, or the interest rates and the credit environment as well as general economic factors and other factors over which we have no control may not be favorable. This may hinder our ability to service our existing debt or obtain additional debt financing.
We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.
Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program will reduce the market liquidity for our stock and could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility. Any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible strategic opportunities and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances.
 If securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community or publish negative research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts publish research reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone regarding our business, financial or operating performance, industry or end-markets, our share price could decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. Shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares held by our insiders and subject to periodic “blackout” periods, or held by our “affiliates” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and any unvested restricted stock awards.
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.
While we recently amended our charter documents to phase-out the classified structure of our board and to remove the provision providing that directors may only be removed for cause, other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
•authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock; 
 •require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent; 


•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chair of our board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer; 
 •establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; 
 •prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; 
 •provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and 
 •require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Provisions in our credit facilities also deter or prevent a business combination. In addition, institutional shareholder representative groups, shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices, including anti-takeover provisions, such as those listed above. We generally will consider recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups, but we will make decisions based on what our board and management believe to be in the best long-term interests of our company and stockholders; however, these groups could make recommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our positions. Finally, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.
Our amended and restated bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:
•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 
 •any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 
 •any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and 
 •any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine. 
 If a court were to find the Delaware exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.
 Our amended and restated bylaws further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions do not apply to any cause of action arising under the Exchange Act.
Both of these exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.
We do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, service our debt, and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, stockholders must rely

on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment, if any. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to restrictions in our credit facilities as well as the restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us.
