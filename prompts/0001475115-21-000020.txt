Item 1. Business
Overview
Eventbrite is a global self-service ticketing and experience technology platform that serves event creators and empowers their success. Our mission is to bring the world together through live experiences, and since inception, we have been at the center of the experience economy, helping to transform the way people organize and attend events.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has tested our mission, our company and event creators in unprecedented ways. Yet, even as people around the world follow guidance to shelter in place and practice social distancing, we believe the human need to connect and feel part of a community, to share ideas, entertain and learn remains as strong as ever. For more than a decade, Eventbrite has been there, meeting this core need and sparking human connection in nearly 180 countries.
The Eventbrite platform was built as a self-service platform to make it possible for anyone to create and sell tickets to live experiences. Creators—the people who bring others together to share their passions, artistry and causes through live experiences—are our North Star, and we have built, and continue to build, our platform to provide them with an intuitive, secure and reliable way to plan and execute their live and online events and scale their operations. We have a creator-aligned business model: we succeed when our creators succeed. We allow hosts of free events to use our platform for free and we charge creators of paid events on a per-ticket basis when an attendee purchases a paid ticket for an event. Our platform integrates seamlessly with internally-developed and third-party features designed to help our creators sell more tickets and scale their businesses. 
The global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our company and the events industry as a whole as disease and government and third-party preventative and protective measures have limited the ability to gather in-person. We acted swiftly to implement cost savings, access capital to strengthen our financial position and shift our strategy to focus on our self-service creator experience and support for virtual events. Although our 2020 paid ticket volumes remained well below normal levels due to restrictions on in-person gatherings, we continued to see meaningful creator engagement throughout 2020 as creators pivoted to hosting virtual events and live events returned in select markets. We expect the recovery of live events will be neither quick nor linear, but we believe that by leaning into our core strengths—entrepreneurial creators, smaller events and self-service—we will help our creators successfully navigate the recovery and believe we have positioned Eventbrite for success over the long term.
In 2020, we helped more than 650,000 creators issue over 230 million free and paid tickets to approximately 4.6 million events in nearly 180 countries.
Our Opportunity
As of 2018, the global “experience economy” represented an estimated market opportunity of 16 billion paid tickets. We have positioned ourselves as a leader specializing in mid-market experiences—the millions of events globally that fall between stadium-scale events and small personal gatherings. Prior to coming to Eventbrite, many event creators used ad hoc solutions, including spreadsheets and pen and paper, to bring their events to life. We believe we uniquely solve their specific needs and enable them to bring their passions to their audiences. 
Our Growth Strategy
2020 gave us the opportunity to revisit core, long-term choices about who we serve and how we differentiate ourselves from our competitors. 
While Eventbrite has and will continue to open its arms to event creators who can successfully self-serve and host events on our platform, frequent creators are at the center of our strategy. Frequent creators typically host live (virtual and/or in-person) events monthly, with fewer than 50 attendees per event. They quickly build their audience, constantly evolve to keep growing and aim to make a career out of their events-based offering. In 2020, over two-thirds of all ticket fees were generated by frequent creators, who hosted five times more paid events than the average paid-event creator. Frequent creators feel confident when they are able to bring people together and run a successful event that helps them build their audience. For them, success is defined in simple terms: a well-attended event with happy attendees who plan to come back. Eventbrite is their tool for both expressing their skills and building their community.
Many frequent creators operate by cobbling together a handful of disparate services and vendors to sustain their events based business. Our strategy is to solve their specific needs through a holistic self-service solution that builds their confidence, enables them to reach new audiences and grow their business.

The key elements of our growth strategy are:
Build Creator Confidence. We strive to build a product experience and brand that will delight our frequent creators and help give them the confidence to hold more events and achieve their business goals, thereby driving our own success and revenue. We plan to build tools that will enable creators to expand their reach and engagement, as we refine our platform to make it even more intuitive and easy-to-use, particularly for creating and managing multiple events. Our industry insights and reinforcement of creators’ success are designed to give creators confidence to hold another event.
Leverage our Scale. The market for event management solutions remains highly fragmented, and we intend to use our scale to provide a differentiated experience for our creators and consumers. We plan to continue to invest in search engine optimization and authoritative content to reinforce the prominence of our destination and the visibility of our event listings—both of which are key competitive advantages. We also plan to provide creators with actionable insights from creator and consumer data, and engage our millions of consumers through an impactful, memorable product experience.
Win Consumer Trust. We believe that by earning consumer trust we will be able to provide our event creators with a larger, more engaged audience, thereby driving our own success and revenue. We plan to enhance our search and discovery capabilities to enable consumers to more easily find events that are high quality and relevant to them. Further, we intend to use our data capabilities to provide reliable and relevant recommendations to consumers to drive reach and engagement. We also plan to build buyer confidence by increasing confidence in the event creators they are buying from.
We believe that these three elements will help set us apart from our competitors. As we better attract and retain frequent creators, they will create more events on the Eventbrite platform. More events will lead to more consumers on the Eventbrite platform. Greater scale allows us to provide smarter insights and tools for creators and consumers alike. And by providing more and more value to both creators and consumers, we believe we can become the most trusted-and most used-platform for events.
COVID-19 Impact on our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic and the self-imposed social distancing and government mandates to restrict gatherings of people have had a significant negative impact on our results of operations for 2020. Although we have seen our revenue partially recover since its low point in March 2020, particularly as we saw live events return in some countries outside the United States where COVID-related mandates eased or ended, our net revenue and paid ticket volume remained well below historic averages in the fourth quarter of 2020. Throughout the year, we experienced a significant decrease in our net revenues as a result of decreased paid ticket volume, increased refunds of our fees and increased estimated future refunds of our fees. We also recorded a significant increase in our reserves for estimated chargebacks and refunds related to advance payouts and higher impairment charges for creator signing fees and creator advances.
In the first half of 2020, we acted quickly to adjust to a world gripped by the global pandemic. In April 2020, we decided to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who are able to use our platform with limited training, support or professional services. Many of these services were costly for us to deliver and afforded limited scope for sustainable differentiation or strong profitability. As a result of ceasing these offering, however, we may no longer be the best ticketing option for some creators and, consequently, have renegotiated or terminated some of our pre-existing customer contracts. At this time, we are not able to estimate with confidence the number of creators or the amount of revenue that may leave or has left our platform as a result of our strategy refocus as opposed to the impact of events simply not being held due to COVID-19.
In addition to our strategy refocus, we strengthened our Company by reducing ongoing costs by at least $100 million annually and raising capital we believe will help us to successfully execute our long-term strategy. For our creators, we provided guidance and functionality to enable them to carefully resume in-person events in compliance with social-distancing mandates. We also introduced new features such as creator Credits to compensate attendees for cancelled events instead of cash, and integrations with partners like Zoom to ease the transition to digital events. Internally, in addition to continuing to invest in our platform, we have worked to hone our customer acquisition strategy. We believe that the steps we have taken since March 2020—focusing on the most attractive customer segments and investing in our self-service business model—will help position Eventbrite as a strong player in our market.
Our Platform
We leverage technology to connect event creators and attendees through live experiences. Our platform consists of the Eventbrite Platform, our event creators and our technology.

The Eventbrite Platform
Eventbrite was founded with a creator-first ethos and our deep connection to creator communities around the world has helped us to anticipate their needs across the lifecycle of their events. From marketing and ticketing to event analytics, we built our self-service solution by listening to our creators. In November 2020, we acquired ToneDen, a social marketing platform to help enhance our customer engagement capabilities by offering our creators various marketing tools. 
 We designed our platform to produce consistent and reliable performance and to handle surges in traffic and transaction volume associated with high-demand on-sales and support millions of events each year. This approach gives creators a platform that can scale to their needs, offering everything from basic registration and ticketing to a fully-featured event management platform.
We offer alternative pricing packages in order to be able to meet the varying needs of creators who come to our platform. We offer three different pricing packages with corresponding levels of features to provide flexibility for each creator: Essentials, Professional and Premium. To help drive the growth of our business, we have periodically adjusted the pricing and components of our packages.
Our Event Creators
Event creators are the heart and soul of Eventbrite, and we build our platform with them in mind. Eventbrite creators are predominantly small teams, composed of 10 or fewer people. Most find their way to Eventbrite by keyword search, on the recommendation of other creators, or through their own Eventbrite experiences as attendees. Prior to coming to Eventbrite, many of our creators used ad hoc solutions, including generic email and spreadsheet programs, to track attendees and ticket sales.
While any event creator can host self-service events on our platform, our frequent creators are the key target for our business. These creative entrepreneurs tend to have a passion or a skill that they express through events, events tend to be the center of their business and they excel at community-building, especially online.
Our engineering team has built a sophisticated platform to meet the complex needs of millions of event creators across borders, languages and devices. We are continuing to strengthen our platform infrastructure as we shift from a monolithic architecture to one based on microservices. We believe the microservices infrastructure we are building will improve our platform's overall velocity, scalability and availability and ultimately benefit our event creators.
In the second half of 2020, we decided to leverage more of Amazon Web Service's technology, including Kinesis, DynamoDB and Step Functions, which we believe will result in increased engineering efficiency and enable our engineering team to dedicate more resources toward delivering customer value.
Built for Self-Service
Our self-service approach has allowed us to pioneer a powerful business model that drives our go-to-market strategy and allows us to efficiently serve a large number and variety of creators. It also enabled us to reposition our strategy during COVID-19 to continue building the best product for our creators while effectively managing our operational expenses. Historically, we derived approximately half our revenue from creators who signed themselves up to use our platform and approximately half our revenue from creators acquired through our sales channels, many of whom expected significant customer support. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who use our platform with minimal training, support or professional services, rather than creators who require significant event success and customer support. 
Third-Party Developers 
Table of Contents

Our technology infrastructure facilitates product development and allows third-party developers to integrate features and functionality from Eventbrite into their environment. Our platform also allows developers to seamlessly integrate services from third-party partners. The Eventbrite App Store makes it easy for creators to find and install these solutions to help them market their events, engage with their audience, increase their productivity and track analytics.
Human Capital
Eventbrite is committed to bringing the world together through live experiences, and we like to think about working at Eventbrite as the ultimate live experience. In order to continue building on our innovative self-service ticketing and experience technology platform, it is important that we attract and retain strong employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program tailored to our employees needs across our global locations. We also provide meaningful perks and work to foster a diverse and inclusive culture and connect our employees with opportunities to make an impact in their communities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 611 employees, 352 were in the United States and 259 were in our international locations. In April 2020, we announced a global workforce reduction impacting approximately 45% of our employees as part of an expense reduction plan related to the impact of COVID-19. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to drive our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, cash bonuses for certain employees, and long-term incentives in the form of stock. We believe that a competitive compensation program with both short-term and long-term award opportunities tied to the achievement of meaningful performance metrics, allows us to align employees with stockholders interests. In addition to our compensation programs, we also offer benefits tailored to our local employees globally such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, unlimited paid time off, paid parental leave, retirement plans and a wide variety of perks and stipends. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
We believe that progress as a society and as a company comes from proactively fostering diversity, equity and inclusion with tangible, evidence-based practices that we believe are key to attracting and retaining top talent. We are committed to hiring and retaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive team through initiatives that will ensure we are considering a diverse slate of candidates for all mid-level and higher positions and conducting audits to ensure pay equity. To foster an increased sense of inclusion at Eventbrite, we are committed to hosting ongoing workshops, conversations, exercises and training to explore how we can create change in our roles to foster more diversity, equity, and inclusion. Further we support social justice by using our platform and marketing channels to amplify creators and attendees that represent diverse genders, sexuality, race and ethnic groups and to promote racial and social justice, equality, equity and civic action, and prioritizing diversity in our vendors. Our employee “BriteBelonging'' groups also help to build an inclusive culture through company events and education, participation in our recruitment efforts, and input into our hiring strategies.
Social Impact 
Our social impact mission is to amplify the power of live connections and lift up one another, our communities, and the planet. We believe our commitment to these live connections enhances our efforts to attract and retain high performing employees. Through our BriteImpact program, our employees are offered paid volunteer time to engage with their communities and further advance causes they believe in. We have lobbied and advocated on behalf of the event community impacted by COVID-19 and empowered event creators to prioritize safety when hosting in person events with our COVID-19 Safety Playbook for Events. Further, to enhance voter turnout in the United States, we partnered with Headcount, to assist event creators in providing their attendees with a path to voter registration when buying tickets to their events.
Competition
The market for event management solutions is highly fragmented and is impacted by shifting creator and attendee needs and changing technology and consumer trends. We also compete with internally-developed systems. This competitive landscape provides creators and attendees with many channels to promote or engage with live experiences.
We believe that our competitors fall into four broad groups: internally-developed ad hoc systems that creators cobble together on their own; event management software vendors, who are typically dedicated to a particular category of events in a limited number of countries; smaller niche or regional providers, who are typically smaller in scale and have limited technology 
Table of Contents

and feature functionality; and more recently, large technology companies who have added products in the online events space and whose user-bases have substantial event-related activity, such as Facebook, Alphabet and Zoom. 
With respect to each of these competitor types, we seek to differentiate ourselves by being an event technology platform first and foremost, continuing to build a self-service product that will delight event creators, leveraging our scale and helping to build larger, more engaged audiences for our event creators.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technology, is an important factor in the success of our business. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents laws, in the U.S. and abroad. We also use contractual provisions and restrictions governing access to our proprietary technology, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and companies with which we conduct business. As of December 31, 2020, we had 13 issued patents, which expire between 2031 and 2032, and one patent application pending in the United States. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology.
Government Regulations
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, ticketing, payments, export taxation or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
