The CD&R Offer stated that any transaction would be subject to (i) approval by a special committee (“Special Committee”) of our independent directors; and (ii) a vote in favor of the transaction by a majority of the voting power represented by the shares of our common stock owned by stockholders not affiliated with CD&R.
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) previously formed a Special Committee to evaluate and consider any potential or actual proposal from CD&R and any other alternative proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company.
The CD&R Offer provides that CD&R reserves the right to withdraw or modify the CD&R Offer at any time and no legally binding obligation with respect to any transaction will exist unless and until mutually acceptable definitive documentation is executed and delivered by us and CD&R. There can be no assurance that the transaction proposed by CD&R or any related transaction will be completed or as to the terms of any such potential transaction, including with respect to pricing or timing.
Overview
Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise, the “Company,” “Cornerstone,” “we,” “us” or “our”) became a newly formed company on November 16, 2018 as the result of a merger (the “Merger”) between NCI Building Systems, Inc. (“NCI”) and Ply Gem Parent, LLC (“Ply Gem”) wherein Ply Gem was merged into NCI, incorporated in the State of Delaware, and 58,709,067 shares of NCI common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, were issued to the holders of all the equity interests in Ply Gem. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Merger with Ply Gem.”
We are the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America. The Company serves residential and commercial customers across the new construction and repair & remodel markets. We believe our business model emphasizes a commitment to our customers and operational excellence, supported by strong sourcing, vertical integration and engineering & design capabilities across an extensive national manufacturing footprint, and leveraging robust distribution channel access. Substantially all of the Company’s operations and customers are in North America.
We believe we have one of the broadest product offerings with the most well-regarded brand portfolio and value-added services in our industry. We have established a leading market position in the majority of our product categories within the North American exterior building products market, including vinyl windows, vinyl siding, stone veneer installation, metal accessories, metal roofing/wall systems, and a top-three position in engineered metal building systems. Our expansive product offering and brand portfolio enable us to better serve our customers across the multiple end markets in which we operate, and we have worked to position ourselves as a one-stop-shop solution for exterior building products.
We have an extensive coast-to-coast network of manufacturing, distribution, and branch office facilities throughout North America. We operate 107 manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Canada, supported by a network of 52 distribution and branch office facilities. Our manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, which we believe provides cost and competitive advantages. We continually invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to drive efficiencies, enhance safety and improve our cost structure, including the introduction of various automation technologies.
We are mindful of the harmful effects of global climate change and the contributions to climate change from manufacturing operations and the end-use of building construction products. We have made and continue to make progress on our work related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. 
We believe our vertically integrated, cost-advantaged manufacturing platform, along with our national scale, expansive product offerings, leading brands, multi-channel distribution network servicing long-tenured customers and dedicated employees, create significant competitive advantages relative to other exterior building products manufacturers.
Our principal offices are located at 5020 Weston Parkway, Suite 400, Cary, North Carolina 27513, and our telephone number is (866) 419-0042.

Operating Segments
We design, engineer, manufacture, install residential products and market external building products through three operating segments: Windows, Siding, and Commercial. Our segments are exposed to the construction industry, whose net sales have historically fluctuated based on seasonality, with increases in the second and third fiscal quarters when construction activity is the most robust, which generally results in higher sales and profits in these periods. Working capital requirements have historically been greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of inventory to support the heavier construction season. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 had different working capital requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants (collectively, the “COVID-19 pandemic”). 
Windows Segment
In our Windows segment, we offer a broad line of windows and doors at multiple price tiers for residential new construction and residential repair and remodel end markets primarily in the United States and Canada. Our principal products include vinyl, aluminum, wood and aluminum clad-wood windows and patio doors, as well as steel, wood, and fiberglass entry doors. We frequently introduce new products to our product portfolio, enabling further penetration of new distribution channels and customers. We intend to complement this organic growth with continued strategic acquisitions in this segment, and we intend to drive margin improvement through focused price discipline and improved product mix, as well as continuous improvement and increased automation in our manufacturing operations.
The breadth of our product offering and our multiple price-point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing), end user markets (residential new construction and residential repair and remodel) and customer types (entry level, move-up and high-end). Our collection of leading brands in this segment includes: Ply Gem, Simonton, Atrium, American Craftsman, Silver Line, Cascade Windows, Prime Windows, Great Lakes Window, and North Star.
We sell our windows and doors through multiple distribution channels. Our residential new construction product lines are sold across a diversified customer base, which includes independent building products dealers, regional/national lumberyards and homebuilders. Our residential repair and remodel window products are primarily sold through independent home improvement dealers, one-step distributors and retail home centers. Dealers typically market directly to homeowners or contractors in connection with remodeling requirements, while distributors focus primarily on selling to local independent retailers. We have long-tenured customer relationships across the channels we serve in this segment, and we have been a key supplier to a majority of the nation’s largest homebuilders for over 10 years. 
In Canada, sales for residential new construction are predominantly made on a direct basis to homebuilders and contractors, while residential repair and remodel construction products are primarily sold not only through high-end independent dealers and regional lumberyards, but also directly to contractors and consumers through our supply-and-install services. We distribute Ply Gem Canada products through our distribution centers across Western Canada. In Ontario, we manufacture and distribute North Star branded windows primarily for the premium-priced tier of the residential repair and remodel market.
Siding Segment
In our Siding segment, we offer a broad suite of exterior cladding, fencing and stone products, other accessories products at multiple price tiers for the residential new construction and residential repair and remodel end markets, and stone installation that is sold directly to builders and general contractors. Our principal products include vinyl siding and skirting, composite siding, steel siding, vinyl and aluminum soffit, aluminum trim coil, aluminum gutter coil, fabricated aluminum gutter protection, PVC trim and moldings, window and door trim, injection molded designer accents such as shakes, shingles, shutters and vents, vinyl fencing and railing, and stone veneer.
We intend to drive organic growth in this segment through focused product innovation in siding and new product development in attractive adjacent product lines. We have successfully expanded our siding product offering to include innovative alternatives to our existing portfolio, including a luxury vinyl siding alternative and stone veneer. In stone veneer, 
we have increased market share through our differentiated business model and national footprint with a strong network of architects, general contractors and builders.
We believe we are currently the largest manufacturer of vinyl siding in North America. We believe we are the second largest provider of stone veneer in North America, and the only turnkey installation provider of stone solutions on a national basis. Our collection of leading brands in this segment includes the following:

Siding & Accessories | Cellular PVC Trim | Vinyl Fencing and Railing | Stone Veneer | Gutter Protection
Ply Gem | Ply Gem | Ply Gem | Ply Gem | Leaf Relief 
Mastic | | | Environmental Stoneworks | Snap Tight 
Georgia-Pacific (licensed) | | | ClipStone | Leaf Smart 
Mitten | | | Canyon Stone | Leaf Logic 
Variform | | | | 

We sell our siding, fencing and stone products through multiple distribution channels, including wholesale and specialty distributors, retail home centers, manufactured housing producers, homebuilders and contractors. In the specialty channel, we have an extensive network of independent dealers and distributors serving contractors and homebuilders nationwide. We believe we are well-positioned in this channel with over 11,000 distribution locations and partnerships with many of the largest and most successful distributors in the industry. In Canada, our complete offering of vinyl siding, accessories, trim, and moldings and attached stone veneers, along with in-house manufactured and third-party sourced complementary products, are distributed nationwide, primarily through our distribution centers and to retail home centers, lumberyards and contractors.
Commercial Segment
In our Commercial segment, we design, engineer, manufacture and distribute extensive lines of metal products for the low-rise non-residential construction market under multiple brand names and through a nationwide network of manufacturing plants and distribution centers. Low-rise non-residential, which we generally define as building applications of up to five stories, typically lags housing cycles by 18 to 24 months.
Our principal products in this segment include:
Metal Building Systems – Metal building systems consist of engineered structural members and panels that are fabricated and roll-formed in a factory. These systems are custom designed and engineered to meet project requirements and then shipped to a construction site complete and ready for assembly with no additional field welding required. Engineered building systems manufacturers design an integrated system that meets applicable building code and designated end use requirements. These systems consist of primary structural framing, secondary structural members (purlins and girts) and metal roof and wall systems or conventional wall materials manufactured by others, such as masonry and concrete tilt-up panels.
Metal Roofing and Wall Systems – These products are used in new construction and in repair and retrofit applications for industrial, commercial, institutional, agricultural, rural, and residential uses. Metal components are used in a wide variety of construction applications, including purlins and girts, roofing, standing seam roofing, walls, doors, trim and other parts of traditional buildings, as well as in architectural applications and engineered building systems.
Coil Coatings – As one of the largest coil coaters in the country, Metal Coaters specializes in the toll processing of customer-owned light gauge metal to deliver coil coating solutions throughout the United States. Metal Prep is one of the largest providers of pre-painted hot rolled steel in the United States and provides heavy gauge coil coating solutions to the construction industry.
We believe we offer a number of advantages over traditional construction alternatives, including shorter construction time, more efficient use of materials, lower construction costs, greater ease of expansion and lower maintenance costs. Our Commercial segment also provides metal coil coating services for low-rise non-residential construction applications, servicing both internal and external customers. We sell our products for both new construction and repair and remodel applications across a broad range of markets and customer solutions, including distribution & warehouse facilities, manufacturing & industrial facilities, as well as automotive, aviation, agricultural, healthcare, educational and retail facilities, among others.
We believe there is a meaningful opportunity to drive growth in this segment through select strategic acquisitions. We intend to drive margin improvement through focused price discipline and improved product mix, as well as continuous improvement initiatives and increased automation in our manufacturing operations.
We believe we maintain leading positions across all of our key product categories in this segment and we believe that our brands, many of which have been in use for several decades, are well-recognized by our customers and industry associations. Our collection of leading brands in this segment includes the following:

Metal Building Systems | Components | Metal Roofing | Coil Coatings
Metallic Building Systems | MBCI | Union Corrugating Company | Metal Coaters
Ceco Building Systems | American Building Components | Reed’s Metals | Metal Prep 
Star Building Systems | Metal Depots | | 
Heritage Building Systems | | | 
Robertson Building Systems | | | 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities. Specifically, we use PVC resin, glass and aluminum in our residential products and steel in our non-residential products. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time and are primarily sourced in North America. Generally, we have been able to pass price increases onto our customers. The results of operations can be impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material cost increase and our price capture.
Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources, and the number of suppliers is adequate to support production. The Company is not dependent on any single source of supply except for aluminum, which is sourced from a single supplier. 
Competition
We are the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America and have established a leading market position for many of our core product categories including: vinyl windows; vinyl siding; metal accessories; metal roofing and wall systems; stone veneer, as the only turnkey installation provider of stone solutions on a national basis; and a leading position in engineered metal building systems. 
We compete with a number of other domestic manufacturers. Our vinyl siding competitors include CertainTeed, Alside, Westlake Royal Building Products and smaller regional competitors. Our aluminum accessories competitors include Rollex, Euramax, Gentek and other smaller regional competitors. Our vinyl fencing and railing competitors including U.S. Fence, Homeland, Westech, Bufftech, and Azek. Our cellular PVC trim and moulding competitors include Azek, Inteplast, Kommerling (KOMA), Wolfpac (Versatex), Tapco (Kleer), CertainTeed and Westlake Royal Building Products. Our stone veneer competitors include Boral (Cultured Stone and Eldorado Stone), Coronado Stone and smaller regional competitors.
The window and patio door sector remains fragmented, comprised primarily of local and regional manufacturers with limited product offerings. The sector’s competitors in the United States include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Pella, MI Home Products and Andersen, and other regional brands, including Weathershield and others. Competitors in Canada include Jeld-Wen, All Weather, Durabuilt, Vinylbilt and numerous regional brands. We generally compete on service, product performance, product offering, sales and support. We believe all of our products are competitively priced and that we are one of the few manufacturers to serve all end markets and price points on a national basis. 
We compete with a number of other manufacturers of metal components, metal coil coaters, and engineered building systems for the building industry, including Nucor, Bluescope, Mueller, Kingspan, and Central States. Many of these competitors operate on a regional basis. We have two primary nationwide competitors in the engineered building systems market and three primary nationwide competitors in the metal components market. However, the metal components market is more fragmented than the engineered building systems market.
We believe the diversity of our revenue base across geographies, end markets, channels, customers, products, and raw materials provides us with significant benefits. We operate a broad manufacturing and distribution platform of 159 facilities across North America, enabling us to serve customers across all 50 U.S. states and all 10 Canadian provinces, thereby limiting our dependence on any one specific geographic region. This integrated North American footprint also enables deeper relationships with large homebuilders and retail customers due to our ability to serve them on a nationwide basis. We are also diversified across residential new construction, residential repair and remodel and low-rise non-residential construction end markets. We employ a multichannel distribution strategy with a broad product portfolio serving thousands of customers 
across North America, including over 5,000 distribution partners, which serves to insulate our business model from any negative trends in any one particular channel, customer or product. The breadth of diversification across our business, from what we sell, to where we sell and to whom we sell, enables significant resiliency in our business model by insulating us from any negative trends or fluctuations in any single market segment, distribution channel, customer segment or product category.
Intellectual Property
We possess a wide array of intellectual property rights across our segments, including patents, pending patent applications, trademarks, tradenames, licenses, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights. In connection with the marketing of our products, we generally obtain trademark protection for our brand names. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. While we do not believe our segments are dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products.
We license the Georgia-Pacific trademark for our Georgia-Pacific private label vinyl siding products sold through BlueLinx. We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Backlog
Our Windows and Siding segments had a backlog of approximately $539.4 million and $172.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. We expect to fill 100% of this backlog during 2022. Within our Commercial segment, the total backlog of orders for our products, primarily engineered building systems, was $666.9 million at December 31, 2021. We anticipate that approximately 24% of the backlog within the Commercial segment will extend beyond one year. Job orders included in backlog are generally cancelable by customers at any time for any reason; however, cancellation charges may be assessed. Occasionally, orders in the backlog are not completed and shipped for reasons that include changes in customer requirements and the inability of customers to obtain necessary financing or zoning variances.
Business Strategy
We are relentlessly committed to our customers and to creating great and sustainable building solutions that enable communities to grow and thrive. By focusing on operational excellence every day, we create a platform for future growth and invest in market-leading residential and commercial building brands. We play an essential role in our communities where people live, work and play to enable those communities to grow and thrive. 
We have developed and continue to implement a well-defined business strategy focused on several primary elements:
Profitable Growth. The Company intends to expand into new and existing markets by leveraging its customer relationships and full portfolio of leading products. We believe that our customers look to the Company for quality products, dependable service and the national footprint required for large homebuilders and retail customers. We participate in the large exterior building products market and have established leading market positions in many of our core product categories. Given our broad market participation, our growth strategy is differentiated by being focused and targeted on market segments exhibiting favorable characteristics, industry positioning and growth outlook. 
We believe we have a meaningful opportunity for organic growth through product line extension and new product development with innovation being a key pillar of our organic growth strategy. We also believe we have an opportunity to drive cross-selling of our products to deepen penetration, drive growth and maximize profitability across customer channels.
Using a highly collaborative selling approach, the Company intends to grow in attractive market sectors, emphasizing those spaces that are highly fragmented, demand high service and value the reliability and efficiency offered by the Company’s products. 
In addition to driving organic growth, we believe that we have a meaningful opportunity to grow through acquisitions, in a manner that is both prudent and profitable. 
Operational Excellence. Cornerstone Building Brands operates with a relentless drive for exceptional results and a passion for superior execution. The Cornerstone Production System (CPS) drives how we improve execution effectiveness and efficiency to deliver margin expansion across our business. Additionally, the Company embraces a continuous improvement culture that is charged with increasing efficiency, optimizing costs, eliminating waste, encouraging organizational agility and building greater brand equity to fuel growth and establish Cornerstone Building Brands as a “supplier of choice” for our customers. This requires the Company’s ongoing commitment to attract, retain and develop the best talent, a paramount focus on the safety of our employees, and a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This is particularly evident during periods of high risk, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where we continue to drive our culture of safety and employee care through rapid and effective implementation of safety guidelines throughout our business. This also includes making investments in automation while maximizing quality within our manufacturing facilities, transforming the 
way work gets done, and deploying capital in ways we believe will drive the greatest returns for our stockholders over the long-term.
The relentless focus on superior execution and our culture of continuous improvement create and protect our position as a cost-advantaged manufacturer with a highly variable and flexible cost structure and continue to favorably impact our financial results. 
Disciplined Capital Allocation. The Company is intently focused on providing the highest returns for stockholders through its capital allocation framework, which includes: (1) investing in the Company’s core business through capital expenditures and other organic growth initiatives; (2) pursuing strategic acquisitions to broaden its portfolio and capabilities across the residential and commercial markets, with a focus on adjacent exterior building products and related services; and (3) targeting long-term net debt leverage of 2.0x to 2.5x. As part of this framework, the Company may also restructure, reposition or divest non-core product lines or assets.
We balance the investment in our core business by focusing on high-return initiatives supporting leading positions in large markets where we can build scale and drive efficiency as well as investments in growing markets that leverage operational and distribution channel capabilities. Our acquisition criteria are focused on opportunities that are highly strategic, synergistic and accretive, and we focus on well positioned businesses with strong financial returns. Overall, our capital allocation framework is balanced between a focus on debt repayment and opportunistic investment in high return initiatives.
Restructuring
We continue to execute on our plans to improve cost efficiency through the optimization of our combined manufacturing plant footprint and the elimination of certain fixed and indirect selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) costs. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of $26.2 million. See Note 6 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Acquisitions & Divestitures
We have a history of making strategic acquisitions within our industry, and we regularly evaluate growth opportunities both through acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that there are opportunities for growth through acquisitions in the Windows, Siding and Commercial segments, and our goal is to supplement organic growth with opportunistic strategic acquisitions that meet our strict criteria.
Consistent with our growth strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase of businesses, assets, and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. Such acquisition efforts may involve participation by us in processes that have been made public, involve a number of potential buyers and are commonly referred to as “auction” processes, as well as situations in which we believe we are the only party or one of the very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. These acquisition efforts often involve assets that, if acquired, would have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We also evaluate from time to time possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such assets or businesses are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy.
Sustainability
Cornerstone Building Brands is uniquely positioned to make positive impacts on the communities we serve as we continue our journey to become North America’s premier manufacturer of exterior building solutions. To do so, we consider how we can increase manufacturing efficiencies, reduce environmental impacts, take care of our people, and uphold professional integrity and ethics in everything we do.
We recognize our responsibility as a provider of building solutions to communities across North America to incorporate sustainability into our products and business operations. Our business was formed by brands that have been making sustainability-focused decisions for several years, and now we are building on that foundation to challenge ourselves to do more. In 2021, we honored this commitment by establishing Board of Director oversight for ESG initiatives, hiring dedicated ESG leaders, creating an ESG Council, and completing an ESG materiality assessment. As we continue to develop an integrated strategy of financial growth and corporate responsibility for the future, we acknowledge that there is still much work to do as we take the next steps on our sustainability journey. 
We believe that we can use our footprint for good and act as stewards of the environment. By addressing energy usage and operational environmental impacts, we seek to have a positive impact for both our stakeholders and the planet. We are committed to the well-being of our employees and the communities and customers we serve. We believe that our sustainable business practices provide positive social benefits to our people. Our highest priority is always the safety of our employees. We feel a responsibility not only to uphold product integrity and safety, but also to leverage innovation and stewardship to 
make products that meet the needs of our customers and promote sustainability. We are committed to conducting business at the highest levels of ethics every day.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment; govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; protect the health and safety of our employees and the end-users of our products; regulate the materials used in our products; and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits could result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, consent orders, requirements to install pollution controls or other abatement equipment, or civil sanctions.
We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate, or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.
Changes in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other environmental liabilities or obligations with respect to our products or business activities, or the imposition of new regulatory requirements for our facilities may lead to additional costs that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We do not believe that compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, including existing requirements to investigate and remediate contamination, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or manufacturing processes.
The following are representative environmental, health and safety requirements relating to our operations:
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and foreign laws. These laws govern emissions of air pollutants from industrial stationary sources, such as our manufacturing facilities, and impose various permitting, air pollution control, emissions monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Such laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for constructing or modifying our facilities in ways that have the potential to produce new or increased air emissions; obtain and comply with operating permits that limit air emissions or certain operating parameters, or employ best available control technologies to reduce or minimize emissions from our facilities. We may be required to purchase air pollution control equipment to comply with air emissions laws.
Greenhouse Gases. Efforts to mitigate the effects of global climate change has led to federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. While GHG regulations do not currently affect our facilities as they are insignificant sources, more stringent federal, regional, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to global climate change and GHG emissions may be adopted. These laws and regulations could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and our customers’ businesses, which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to incur additional capital, operating or other costs. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation or regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our business. In addition, global climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, extreme temperatures and other events that could affect our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and demand for our products.
 Hazardous and Solid Industrial Waste. Our operations generate industrial solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state and foreign laws. RCRA imposes requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste. Industrial wastes we generate in our manufacturing processes, such as used chemicals, may be regulated as hazardous waste, although RCRA has provisions to exempt some of our wastes from classification as hazardous waste. However, our non-hazardous or exempted industrial wastes are still regulated under state law or the less stringent industrial solid waste requirements of RCRA. 
RCRA Corrective Action Program. Certain facilities may be subject to the Corrective Action Program under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by RCRA, and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (“Corrective Action Program”). The Corrective Action Program is designed to ensure that certain facilities subject to RCRA have investigated and remediated releases of hazardous substances at their property.
MW Manufacturers Inc. (“MW”), a subsidiary of Ply Gem Industries, Inc., entered into a September 2011 Administrative Order on Consent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under the Corrective Action Program to address known releases of hazardous substances at MW’s Rocky Mount, Virginia property. A Phase I RCRA 
Facility Investigation (“RFI”) was submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (“VDEQ”) in December 2015, and a Phase II RFI and the Human Health Risk Assessment and Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment were submitted in October 2018. A Limited Corrective Measures Study based on the investigations was submitted to the VDEQ for review and approval in September 2019. Upon completion of a 30-day public comment period, the VDEQ issued its Final Decision and Response to Comments approving a final remedy in May 2021. The final remedy consists of continuing groundwater monitoring until the VDEQ’s corrective actions have been met; and implementing and complying with land use restrictions and institutional controls imposed by an environmental covenant. We have recorded a liability of $4.5 million for this MW site, of which $1.0 million is in other current liabilities and $3.5 million is in other long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”, commonly known as Superfund), and comparable state and foreign laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These include the current and past owners or operators of sites where hazardous substances were released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in certain cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health and welfare or the environment and to seek to recover remediation costs from the responsible parties. 
We currently own or lease, and historically owned or leased, numerous properties that have extensive histories of industrial operations. Hazardous substances may have been released on, under or from these properties, or on, under or from other locations where hazardous wastes have been disposed. Some of these properties have been owned or operated by third parties who may have released hazardous substances for which we could have liability. We could be required to investigate or remediate contaminated property, perform remedial closure activities, or assess and remediate volatile chemical vapors migrating from soil or groundwater into overlying buildings. Our liability for investigating and remediating contamination could be joint and several and could include damages for impacts to natural resources.
The EPA is investigating groundwater contamination at a Superfund site in York, Nebraska, referred to as the PCE/TCE Northeast Contamination Site (“PCE/TCE Site”). Kroy Building Products, Inc. (“KBP”), a subsidiary of Ply Gem Industries, Inc., has been identified as a potentially responsible party at the site and has liability for investigation and remediation costs associated with the contamination. In May 2019, KBP and an unrelated respondent entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (“RI/FS”) of the PCE/TCE Site. A final RI/FS Work Plan was approved by EPA in December 2019. Two phases of RI field sampling have been completed through May 2021 and a Monitoring Well Plan was approved by EPA in November 2021. We have recorded a liability of $4.4 million within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. If necessary, we will adjust our remediation liability if the RI/FS scope materially changes or the EPA imposes additional investigative requirements. We may be able to recover a portion of costs incurred in connection with the PCE/TCE Site from other potentially responsible parties, though there is no assurance we would receive any funds.
Wastewater Discharges. Our operations are subject to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and comparable state and foreign laws. These laws impose requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants from industrial activity into waters of the United States. Such laws may require that we comply with stormwater runoff and wastewater discharge standards or obtain permits limiting our discharges of pollutants. Failure to comply with CWA requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, restrictions on operations, and administrative or civil enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for wastewater discharge or stormwater runoff treatment technology to comply with wastewater permits and water quality standards. 
Employee Health and Safety. We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers. Among other things, we are required to maintain and make available to our employees, state and local government authorities, and others information about hazardous materials used or produced by our operations.
Zoning and Building Code Requirements
The engineered building systems and components we manufacture must meet zoning, building code and uplift requirements adopted by local governmental agencies. We believe that our products are in substantial compliance with applicable zoning, code and uplift requirements. Compliance does not have a material adverse effect on our business.

At Cornerstone Building Brands, corporate stewardship is a responsibility that is deeply embedded in our long brand history. We believe our employees drive our business and our ability to effectively serve our customers and sustain our competitive position. 
Leadership, Talent Acquisition and Talent Management
Our talent strategy is rooted in our Success Model, which is built upon our core values of safety, integrity, innovation and teamwork. 
Our talent philosophy dictates the way we manage our talent processes to ensure transparent, fair, inclusive, and differentiated treatment for all employees and candidates. We measure performance based upon both results achieved and the way in which results are achieved. Our Success Model reinforces the culture that we want to have at Cornerstone Building Brands. It highlights four key leadership elements and associated behaviors our employees must demonstrate to help us effectively lead at every level. The four elements are: Lead Inclusively, Drive Change, Win as One, and Make an Impact. Success Model behaviors, along with goal achievement, comprise a performance rating that is used in our pay for performance and talent review processes. 
We measure performance based upon the results achieved and the way results are achieved. The Success Model is the reference point reinforcing the culture that we want to have at Cornerstone Building Brands. This performance rating is used in our pay for performance and talent review process. Our talent philosophy dictates the way we manage our talent processes to ensure transparent, fair, inclusive, and differentiated treatment for all employees and candidates. 
Our leaders receive training on our three pillars of performance management, succession and talent planning, and learning and talent development. This creates the foundation for our leaders to support their teams to connect their work to our purpose, mission, values, and strategies of the Company, motivating and giving them a higher sense of purpose.
Our talent strategy is focused on having the right people in the right places and a consistent and compelling employee experience. This ensures that we are able to exceed our customers’ expectations and allow our people to develop and increase their career opportunities. Our talent management process:
•Clearly defines roles and goals;
•Establishes clear-cut performance and behavior expectations;
•Focuses work in alignment with business strategy and company goals; and
•Creates consistent, structured processes to enable development and career growth — including extensive curriculum and training programs.
The connection with our Success Model creates an environment that makes us a talent magnet. Core to our talent management strategy is embracing all candidates, no matter their background, race, age or sexual orientation and identity, and delivering a transparent, fair and engaging experience across the organization. We recruit, hire and train candidates using a process that is free from biases for or against any individual or group of candidates. Using technology and grass roots recruiting, we specifically target sources where candidates congregate, and we go to market with an employer brand that highlights the value we place on people and opinions from all walks of life.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
To attract and retain the best employees, we focus on providing competitive pay and benefits. Our programs target the market for competitiveness. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving physical, mental and financial wellness of our employees throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, paid time off, and retirement savings plans.
When designing our base pay compensation ranges, we perform market analyses to ensure ranges are current and our employees are advancing their earning potential. We also perform frequent compensation studies to assess market movement and competitive changes in local marketplaces. We continually review wages in all countries we operate to ensure we are fair, equitable, competitive and can attract and retain the best talent.
We also provide diverse benefit programs that are aligned with our values and focused on supporting employees and their families based on their unique needs. For example, our Employee Assistance Foundation assists employees in need of emergency financial support and is offered to all employees. We also offer a broad range of benefits to support our 
employees wanting to expand their families through adoption benefits, infertility treatment benefits, and paid time off to bond with their new families.
Employee Safety and Wellness
Cornerstone Building Brands is committed to safety as our highest priority. Safety is one of the Company’s core values and nothing is more important to us than providing a safe work environment. We publicly disclose operational health and safety statistics on our rate of recordable injuries and our rate of lost workdays due to injury involving full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees, and contractors. 
Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated our commitment to safety. To support our employees, customers and communities, we took extraordinary measures and invested in practices to protect employees and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Our actions included additional cleaning of our facilities, staggering crews, incorporating visual cues to reinforce social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves, as well as implementing daily health validation at our manufacturing and office facilities. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our Company’s Purpose is to positively contribute to the communities where we live, work, and play. It begins with our employees, a team comprised of many backgrounds, each adding a unique and valued contribution to the success of our organization. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”) promise supports our purpose, mission and core values to have a work environment that is inclusive and equitable for all employees. This creates an environment of mutual respect where our diversity reflects the communities we serve.
Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (the “Council”) began with 12 key leaders who were selected based on capability, sphere of influence, interests and their passion for creating an inclusive culture. In 2021, we added the chairs of each Employee Resource Group to the Council, bringing our total Council to 20 members. The Council has a charter and an ongoing prioritized action plan to accelerate the adoption of DE&I in our processes to positively impact our culture. The Council’s responsibilities include defining metrics, setting targets, benchmarking, providing education and training, seeking employee feedback, and building engagement as well as evaluating the Company’s current initiatives with a DE&I context.
The Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) have expanded the network of advocates including members and allies of Women!, Unity, Pride, and Patriots. Each group has a core active group who meet monthly and the ERGs meet together once per quarter. 
Our success depends on valuing all individuals and leveraging our diverse talent. For more information on the topics above and our management of our human capital resources, please visit our website at https://investors.cornerstonebuildingbrands.com.
