Overview
We are a leader in Analytic Process Automation, or APA. The Alteryx APA software platform unifies analytics, data science and business process automation in one self-service platform to accelerate digital transformation, deliver high-impact business outcomes, accelerate the democratization of data and rapidly upskill modern workforces. Data workers, regardless of technical acumen, are empowered to be curious and solve problems. With the Alteryx APA software platform, users can automate the full range of analytics, data science and processes, embed intelligent decision-making and actions, and empower their organization to enable top and bottom line impact, efficiency gains, and rapid upskilling.
Leveraging data for actionable insights is critical to modern business success, but has become increasingly challenging as the volume, velocity, and variety of data continues to expand. Traditional data analysis tools and processes are slow, complex, difficult to use, and resource-intensive, often requiring multiple steps by data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, information technology, or IT, employees, and other data workers to complete even the most basic analysis. As a result, these point tools and processes are unable to keep pace with the sophistication and speed of analytics demanded by organizations today.
Our platform democratizes access to data-driven insights by expanding the capabilities and analytical sophistication available to all analytic producers, ranging from business analysts to expert programmers and trained data scientists. We unify the analytics and analytic process into one simple self-service experience by combining tasks that were previously distributed among multiple tools and parties. Our platform allows a single user or group of users to easily and quickly discover, access, and prepare data from a multitude of sources, perform a variety of analyses, and deliver analytical output to drive data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes. This is done through a no-code, low-code approach and visual workflows and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can reduce tedious, time-consuming manual tasks to a few mouse-clicks while eliminating the need to write complex software code. The resulting opportunity is significant, as our platform can enable and upskill millions of underserved data workers to do their jobs more effectively.
Our platform has been adopted by organizations across a wide variety of industries and sizes. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 7,100 customers in more than 90 countries, including over 760 of the Global 2000 companies. Our customers include Anheuser Busch, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Chevron Corporation, Daimler AG, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, General Mills, Inc., L'Oreal USA, Inc., Netflix, Inc., Pfizer Inc., salesforce.com, inc., Société Générale S.A., Unilever PLC and Visa Inc.
We employ a “land and expand” business model. Our go-to-market approach often begins with a free trial of Alteryx Designer and is followed by an initial purchase of our platform offerings. As organizations quickly realize the benefits derived from our platform, use frequently spreads across departments, divisions, and geographies through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization and automation of business processes. Both for an initial purchase and as part of expanding a current customer’s use of our products, we have also begun, where appropriate, to target and involve members of the customer’s senior management team to accelerate adoption within their organization. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical, and business processes.
Customers license our platform under a subscription-based model, and we have seen rapid expansion as adoption spreads across an enterprise through an increase in the number of users, additional use cases, and additional products. For each of the last twelve quarters, including the quarter ended December 31, 2020, our dollar-based net expansion rate has exceeded 120%. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics” for additional information regarding our dollar-based net expansion rate and customers. Over the past several years, we have made significant investments to grow our business, including in sales and marketing, infrastructure, operations, and headcount. 
Growth Strategy
Our focus on empowering business analysts and the organizations they serve to quickly and easily access data-driven insights presents a significant opportunity. Key elements of our strategy for growth include:

•Increase our overall customer base. We are accelerating the secular shift towards self-service analytics. As a result, we have the opportunity to increase our current customer base of approximately 7,100 customers through an active “land and expand” strategy. We plan to expand our online and offline marketing efforts to increase demand for our platform and awareness of our brand. We also plan to continue to invest in growing both our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels. In 2021, our direct sales teams have been aligned to certain market and customer opportunities, with an increased focus on Global 2000 companies, in order to reduce the complexity of the organization, redeploy our resources to higher-productivity activities, and maximize our sales opportunities with those companies.
•Expand within our current customer base. We plan on expanding existing customers’ use of our platform by identifying additional use cases, departments, and divisions for our platform and increasing the number of users within our existing customers’ organizations. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is more strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical, and business processes. We also plan to add specialized support through our strategic alliance partners globally to augment our current customer experience and training initiatives.
•Continue to penetrate international markets. We have continued to increase our focus on international markets. We believe that the global opportunity for self-service data analytics solutions is significant and should continue to expand as organizations outside the United States seek to adopt self-service platforms as we have experienced with our existing customers.
•Extend our value proposition. We intend to continue to rapidly improve the capabilities of our platform and invest in innovation and our category leadership. For example, in June 2020, we introduced Alteryx Analytics Hub, our next-generation automation and collaboration product, and Alteryx Intelligence Suite, our augmented machine learning, auto-modeling, and text mining product. We plan to continue to invest in research and development, including hiring top technical talent and maintaining an agile organization that focuses on core technology innovation. In particular, we intend to focus on further developing our cloud capabilities, modernizing the Alteryx Designer experience, and developing a robust extensibility framework for our customers and partners.
•Grow our distribution channels and channel partner ecosystem. We plan to continue investing in distribution channels and our relationships with technology alliances, solution providers, strategic global system integrators, solution partners, and value-added-resellers, or VARs, to help us enter and grow in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. For example, in February 2020, we entered into a strategic relationship with PwC U.S., which included the designation of PwC as a "Global Elite Partner." In February 2021, we also entered into a strategic relationship with HCL America Solutions Inc., which included the designation of HCL as an "Elite Partner." We also plan to continue to collaborate with management consulting firms to drive additional business activity. In addition, we plan to increase our engagement overall with our channel partners worldwide, with these partners having more responsibility for sales to smaller customers in the United States.
•Deepen our user community. We benefit from a vibrant and engaged user community and continue to promote initiatives intended to further expand and energize our community. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted our ability to hold in-person user conferences, which had grown to three annual events worldwide and over 6,400 attendees in 2019, we have utilized and may continue to utilize various forms of digital and virtual events to continue to create market awareness. Additionally, university courses and analytic clubs help evangelize the benefits of our platform and introduce its capabilities to business analysts just starting their careers. We intend to continue expanding our community development efforts and seek to continue enriching the lives of business analysts everywhere. For example, in 2020, we launched Advancing Data and Analytics Potential Together, or ADAPT. ADAPT offers free data training to thousands of workers globally who have found themselves unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Every graduate is certified in the fundamentals of data analytics through Alteryx Core Certification and is given the opportunity to advance to the Udacity Nanodegree program in predictive analytics.

Our Technology
Underpinning our platform is a set of technological innovations that make robust data analytics easy through an in-memory engine, sophisticated analytic models, and an open and modular core:
In-Memory Engine
Our in-memory engine is optimized to process data within RAM and can utilize disk, when necessary, as temporary virtual memory. This facilitates significantly faster and more secure processing of data than traditional disk-based mechanisms while ensuring that the source data remains unaltered and is not duplicated. In addition to our high speed in-memory processing capabilities, our platform enables in-database processing to take advantage of computing resources where the data resides for certain use cases involving large datasets. Key features of our engine include:

•Connected. Business analysts can rapidly connect to data in existing formats and locations, reducing the need for time-consuming data transformation processes that typically require IT personnel.
•Non-persisted. Our engine leverages non-persisted data pipelines to enable users to process large amounts of data securely while applying complex logic every time they run an analytic workflow.
•Scaled-out. While most workflows can be run on any single desktop or laptop, when greater processing capability is required, workloads can be pushed to a server or cluster of servers, including Hadoop or Spark clusters. 
Sophisticated Analytic Models
We enable business analysts, data scientists and citizen data scientists to produce analytics ranging from basic to highly complex, including predictive, prescriptive, and spatial. Specifically, we enable predictive analytics through utilization of R, an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, and Python, a popular programming language for analytics with many publicly available packages. Our capabilities allow transparency and editing of the R and Python code without requiring prior coding experience. In addition, in-database processing enables analysts to scale predictive analytics and harness the value of large sets of data without moving the data out of a database, improving predictive model development performance over traditional approaches. Deep geospatial tools, such as a drive time engine, create the basis for performing location-based analysis.
Open and Modular Core
Our platform is built with an open and modular core that enables additional functions and programming models to interact with it. For example, our platform can utilize R for advanced analytics while providing a simple drag-and-drop interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying code. For sophisticated business analysts, the underlying code is available for review and adjustment. The integration of our platform with R and Python takes advantage of segmented, but integrated, main-memory resources to ensure seamless, fast operations. More recently, we introduced the JavaScript V8 engine for our platform in a similar capacity. This enables the introduction of new HTML5 UI, Server-side JavaScript, and JSON/REST APIs to fuel the innovation being driven from our platform.

None of our associates are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our associates to be good, as evidenced by our annual associate engagement survey results.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, citizenship status, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and associates are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our associates must adhere to a code of business conduct and ethics that sets standards for appropriate behavior and are required to attend annual training on the code of business conduct and ethics and biannual training to help prevent, identify, report, and stop any type of discrimination and harassment.
Our diversity and inclusion council, Alter.Us, encourages associates to engage with and support each other across our employee resource groups, or ERGs. Alter.Us and the ERGs focus on three key priorities: sharing ideas, elevating innovation and promoting authenticity and learning. To facilitate these priorities, we have hosted several trainings and workshops, including several hours of bias and awareness training in 2020 for all people leaders. In 2021, we hired a leader for corporate social responsibility to champion our strategy and build an ongoing framework for our diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental, social and governance efforts.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams work closely together to increase market awareness, drive demand for our platform, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.
Sales
We sell our platform through our direct sales organization and indirect channel partners both internationally and domestically. Our sales strategy relies on a “land and expand” model. Prospective customers can download a fully functional free trial of Alteryx Designer from our website and, as a result, become leads for our sales and marketing teams. Our initial deployments with new customers are typically individual business analysts focused on a single use case such as data preparation and data blending. These initial deployments frequently expand across departments, divisions, and geographies as additional use cases are identified and deployed, and through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization of business processes. As our platform expands throughout organizations and becomes increasingly strategic in nature, our platform is recognized by corporate executives, IT personnel, and organization leaders as the solution to their analytics needs.
Our sales organization is comprised of inside sales teams dedicated to selling to new customers and direct field sales teams responsible for identifying and maximizing future expansion opportunities with our existing customers. Our inside sales and direct field sales teams are tightly integrated to promote an efficient customer acquisition model and seamless growth for expansion opportunities. Our customer success and support organizations are responsible for post-sales training and support, maintaining customer relationships, and renewing existing contracts.
The majority of our domestic sales are through our direct sales organization, with our channel partners having more responsibility for sales to smaller customers. We serve Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and Latin America regions, and select other emerging countries through our direct sales organization and a variety of partners, including VARs and solution providers.
Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for increasing awareness of and generating demand for our platform, creating high-quality leads for our sales force through a mix of volume demand generation and account-based marketing, and fostering our community of users. A central focus of our marketing efforts is to drive awareness of our platform and increase website traffic. These goals are intended to increase downloads of free trials of our platform and encourage use of our free online training, which are integral parts of our customer acquisition process. We utilize a wide range of online and offline marketing initiatives including our website, social media, paid search, email, webinars, partner events, and field events often with analytic leaders and data scientists. Our annual U.S., European, and Asia-Pacific user conferences play a key role in providing current and prospective customers with a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers, training, and the highlighting of customer use cases and best practices.

Our strategic alliance partnerships include global system integrators, strategic consulting and advisory firms, independent software vendors, cloud and data platforms, and solution and augmented technology offerings that enhance and extend our platform and solutions. For example, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and HCL America Solutions Inc. have specific practice areas that leverage Alteryx software. We have optimized integrations and solutions for a variety of independent software vendor solutions, data platforms and software-as-a-service, or SaaS, offerings, including Microsoft Azure Services, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Snowflake Inc., leading robotic process automation, or RPA, solutions, and solutions offered by Google, LLC, International Business Machines Corporation, Oracle Corporation, salesforce.com, inc., and SAP SE, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We natively support output to most visual formats such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation, Qlik Technologies, Inc., and Tableau Software, Inc. 
Solution Providers
Our solution providers consist of system integrators, management consulting firms, and VARs. Solution providers bring product expertise and implementation services and best practices to our customers globally. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 500 solution providers and VARs that create scale for our platform through their network of trained consultants, on-point analytic services, and deep domain expertise. They provide vertical expertise and technical advice while solving complex business challenges and generating repeatable analytic workflows and applications in addition to reselling or bundling our software. Our reseller program is designed to scale growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and care, increase profitability, and increase sales efficiency.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets, and supporting existing customer deployments. Our research and development team, which consisted of 366 employees as of December 31, 2020 located primarily in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts in the United States as well as the Czech Republic, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, comprises dedicated research employees, software engineers, quality assurance engineers, user experience experts, site and site operations engineers, and product managers. We leverage agile development methodologies and work with the latest technologies, resulting in a dynamic, state of the art, automated software development process that has allowed us to deliver high-quality products and services and adapt to market changes and new requirements quickly.
Seasonality
Due to the budgeting cycles of our current and potential customers, historically, we enter into more agreements with new customers and more renewed agreements with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each calendar year than in any other quarter. The impact of seasonality is heightened on subscriptions that are multi-year in nature with more revenue recognized at a point in time when the platform is first made available to the customers, or the beginning of the subscription term, if later, and the remaining portion recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. Seasonality in our business can also be impacted by introductions of new or enhanced products and services, including the costs associated with such introductions, or wider macroeconomic effects, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Competition
The market for self-service data analytics solutions is new and rapidly evolving. In many cases, our primary competitors are manual, spreadsheet-driven processes and custom-built approaches in which potential customers have made significant investments. In addition, we compete with large software companies, including providers of traditional business intelligence tools that offer one or more capabilities that are competitive with our platform. These capabilities include data preparation and/or advanced analytic modeling tools from Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and SAS Institute Inc. Additionally, data visualization companies which already offer products and services in adjacent markets have recently introduced products and services that may become competitive with our offerings in the future. 
We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom might be our current technology partners. In addition, some business analytics software companies offer data preparation options that are competitive with some of the features within our platform, such as Dataiku Ltd., DataRobot, Inc., salesforce.com, inc., TIBCO Software Inc., and Trifacta, Inc.
Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources and greater name recognition than us. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the self-service data analytics software market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and services and technologies are introduced.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of use;
•platform features, quality, functionality, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
•ability to automate analytical tasks or processes;
•ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•software analytics expertise;
•total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including support.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
