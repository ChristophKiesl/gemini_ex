Overview
 
CarCharging is a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. CarCharging offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to easily recharge at various location types.
 
Our principal line of products and services is our Blink EV charging network (the “Blink Network”) and EV charging equipment (also known as electric vehicle supply equipment) and EV related services. Our Blink Network is proprietary cloud-based software that operates, maintains, and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers, and parking companies, who we refer to as our Property Partners, with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations, payment processing, and provides EV drivers with vital station information including station location, availability, and applicable fees.
 
We offer our Property Partners with a flexible range of business models for EV charging equipment and services. In our comprehensive and turnkey business model, we own and operate the EV charging equipment, manage the installation, maintenance, and related services; and share a portion of the EV charging revenue with the property owner. Alternatively, Property Partners may share in the equipment and installation expenses, with us operating and managing the EV charging stations and providing connectivity to the Blink Network. For Property Partners interested in purchasing and owning EV charging stations, that they manage, we can also provide EV charging hardware, site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, and service and maintenance services.
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We currently have approximately 13,346 charging stations deployed of which 5,305 are Level 2 public charging units, 118 DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 2,377 residential charging units in service on the Blink Network. Additionally, we currently have approximately 359 Level 2 charging units on other networks and there are also approximately an additional 5,187 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations. The non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations are all partner owned.


Industry Overview
 
We believe that the market for plug-in electric vehicles has experienced significant growth in recent years in response to consumer demand for vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, greater performance, and with lower environmental emissions. We believe that the demand for EVs has also been spurred in part by federal and state fuel economy standards and other state and local incentives and rebates for EVs. For example, the states of California, Oregon, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts and others have created mandates for EVs with the goal of 3.3 million EVs on the road by 2025. At the same time, oil and gas prices continue to experience spikes and fluctuations, while at the same time the cost of battery technology continues to fall as the battery industry achieves scale. In response, major automotive OEMs have accelerated the adoption of EV models, with more than 25 EV models currently available from Tesla, Nissan, Kia, GM, Ford, Fiat, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Land Rover, Porsche, and many others. According to the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sales of plug-in vehicles since introduction to the market in 2010 is over 500,000 and according to a third-party researcher, sales are expected to grow by a factor of 12 to 3.5 million in 2025.
 
However, we believe that a major impediment to EV adoption has been the lack of EV charging infrastructure, and that a viable model for continued deployment of EV charging infrastructure continues to evolve. Examples of federal programs designed to stimulate development of EV charging infrastructure includes the recent White House announcement of, among other things, programs to release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities, and the launching of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations.
 
According to forecasts by a third-party researcher, sales of EV service equipment globally will grow from approximately 0.425 million units in 2016 to 2.5 million units in 2025. Major utility companies are also working to upgrade their grid infrastructure in order to prepare for mass consumption of electricity by electric vehicles.
 
While many believe that the majority of EV charging occurs at home, we believe the need for a robust, pervasive public EV charging infrastructure is required to eliminate range anxiety (that is, a worried feeling while driving an electric car caused by the driver thinking they might run out of power before reaching their destination). In addition to providing strategic, public charging stations, we believe that it is necessary to provide EV charging solutions to those drivers that do not live in single-family homes, but share parking facilities, including multifamily residential apartment buildings and condominiums. While there are a few, leading competitors and various, smaller EV charging equipment or service providers that have emerged in the market, we believe their products and services are limited. Typically, these companies offer EV charging equipment, an EV charging network, or EV charging services with third party equipment.

● | DCFC. Our DC Fast Charging equipment (“DCFC”) currently has the CHAdeMo connector, which is compatible with Nissan, Kia, and Tesla electric vehicle models (additional models may be potentially available in the future), and typically provides an 80% charge in less than 30 minutes. Installation of DCFC stations and grid requirements are typically greater than Level 2 charging stations, and are ideally suited for transportation hubs and locations between travel destinations. 

 
We intend to enhance our current equipment offerings by developing and offering new generations of EV charging equipment.
 
EV Charging Services
 

● | Blink Network. Our proprietary, cloud-based Blink Network allows us to share convenient and advantageous station management features and pertinent data with Property Partners and EV drivers through user interfaces. These features include real-time station status, payment processing, detailed charging session information, monitoring and troubleshooting stations remotely, as well as standard and customized reporting capabilities on, among others, energy dispensed, greenhouse gases reduced, oil barrels saved, and gallons of fuel saved. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Blink Mobile application. Our proprietary mobile application, available for iOS and Android, provides EV drivers with vital station information, including the ability to locate EV charging stations on the Blink Network, view real-time station status information, pay and initiate EV charging sessions, become a Blink member, and manage their Blink account (billing information, radio frequency identification cards, text messaging, and email notifications). 

 
We believe that we are unique in our ability to provide various business models to property partners and leverage our technology to meet the needs of both property partners and EV drivers. Our property partner business model options include:
 

1. | Host Owned: The Property Partner purchases our EV charging equipment for use by EV drivers and pays for connectivity to the Blink Network as well as payment transaction fees. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Car Charging Owned: We provide EV charging equipment, which we own and maintain, and operate the EV charging services through our Blink Network and share a portion of the revenues generated from the stations with our Property Partner. 
3. | Hybrid: We also offer customized business models that meet individual Property Partner needs and combines features from the aforementioned business models.

Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 
Early Mover Advantage: We continue to leverage our large and defendable first mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both drivers and Property Partners. We believe that there are approximately 91,000 drivers registered with Blink that appreciate the value of EV charging sessions on a leading, established, and robust network. We have thousands of Blink chargers deployed across the United States and the goal is to keep our Property Partners on one consistent network when expanding on any given property.
 
Long-Term Contracts with Property Owners: We have strategic and often long term agreements with location exclusivity for Property Partners across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, car dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condo, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. Some examples are Caltrans, Carl’s Jr., City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Cracker Barrel, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., Garage Management Company, Icon Parking, IKEA, iPark, JBG Associates, Kohls, Kroger Company, LAZ Parking, Macy’s, McDonald’s, Ralphs Grocery Company, Sears, Simon Properties, and SP+ Parking. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently, or had contracts with the EV service providers that we acquired, including ECOtality, the former owner of the Blink related assets.
 
Flexible Business Model: We are able to offer and sell both EV charging equipment as well as access to our robust, cloud-based EV charging software, which we refer to as the Blink Network. We believe that we have an advantage in our ability to provide various business models to Property Partners and leverage our technology to meet the needs of both Property Partners and EV drivers.
 
Ownership and Control of EV Charging Stations and Services: We own a large percentage of our stations, which is a significant differentiation between us and some of our primary competitors. This ownership model allows us to control the settings and pricing for our EV charging services, service the equipment as necessary, and have greater brand management and price uniformity.
 
Experience with Products and Services of Other EV Charging Service Providers. From our early days and through our acquisitions, we have had the experience of owning and operating EV charging equipment provided by other EV charging service providers, including General Electric, ChargePoint, and SemaConnect. This experience has provided us with the working knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of other equipment manufacturers and their applicable EV charging networks.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue to be a leading provider of EV charging solutions by deploying mass scale EV charging infrastructure, and by doing so, enable the accelerated growth of EV adoption and the EV industry. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Relentless Focus on Customer Satisfaction. Increase overall customer satisfaction with new and existing Property Partners and EV drivers by upgrading and expanding the EV charging footprint throughout high demand, high density geographic areas. In addition, improve productivity and utilization of existing EV charging stations, as well as to continue to enhance the valuable features of our EV charging station hardware and the Blink Network. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Leverage Our Early Mover Advantage. We continue to leverage our large and defendable first mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both drivers and Property Partners. We believe that there are tens of thousands of Blink driver registrants that appreciate the value of transacting charging sessions on a leading, established, and robust network experience. We have thousands of Blink chargers deployed across the United States and the tendency, among users, is to stay within one consistent network for expansion on any given property. 
● | Expand Sales and Marketing Resources. Our intention is to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure to capitalize on the growth in the market as well as to expand our go-to-market strategy. Today, we use a direct sales force and intend to continue to expand our efforts as well as invest in a wholesale channel go-to-market strategy that may include wholesale electrical distributors, independent sales agents, utilities, solar distributors, contractors, automotive manufacturers, and auto dealers. 
● | Continue to Invest in Technology Innovation. We will continue to enhance the product offerings available in our EV charging hardware, cloud-based software, and networking capability. This includes the design and launch of our next generation of EV charging solutions, including accelerating the charge currents currently available in EV charging hardware and new, robust Blink Network features in order to distance ourselves from the competition. Our key service solutions allow us to remain technology agnostic, and if market conditions shift, we have the option to leverage pure play hardware providers to augment our products.

Sales
 
We currently maintain an in-house field sales force that maintains business relationships with our Property Partners and develops new sales opportunities through lead generation and marketing. We also sell our EV charging hardware, software services (connectivity to Blink Network), and service plans through reseller partners, which then sell these products and services to property representatives and/or property owners (“hosts”).
 
Our in-house staff performs marketing. To promote and sell our services to property owners and managers, parking companies, and EV drivers, we also utilize marketing and communication channels including press releases, email marketing, websites (www.CarCharging.com, www.BlinkNetwork.com, www.BlinkHQ.com), Google AdWords, and social media. The information on our websites is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
 
We continue to invest in the improvement of the service and maintenance of our Company-owned stations, as well as those stations with a service and maintenance plans, and expanding our cloud-based network capabilities. We anticipate continuing to expand our revenues by selling our next generation of EV charging equipment to current as well as new Property Partners, which includes airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations, expanding our sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, auto original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), solar integrators, and dealers, which will include implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), and subscription plans for EV drivers on our Blink-owned public charging locations.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from fees charged to EV drivers for EV charging in public locations, EV charging hardware sales, and government grants. EV charging fees to EV drivers are based either on an hourly rate, a per kilowatt-hour (“kWh”) rate, or by session, and are calculated based on a variety of factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. EV charging hardware is sold to our Property Partners such as Green Commuter, IKEA, Nashville Music Center, and Wendy’s. In addition, other sources of fees from EV charging services are network fees and payment processing fees paid by our Property Partners.
 
Our Customers and Partners
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. Some examples are Caltrans, City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Cracker Barrel, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., IKEA, JBG Associates, LLC, Kroger Company and Ralphs Grocery Company. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently, or had contracts with the EV services providers that we acquired, including ECOtality, the former owner of the Blink related assets.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from EV charging hardware sales to our Property Partners, fees from public EV charging services to EV drivers, government grants, and marketing incentives.

Competition 
 
The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on the basis of product performance and features, total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability and size of installed base. Our existing competition currently includes ChargePoint, which manufactures EV charging equipment and operates the ChargePoint Network; and EVgo, which offers home and public charging with pay-as-you-go and subscription models. There are other entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market, such as General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect, and Greenlots. We believe these additional competitors struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, the connector type utilized currently restricts the chargers to Tesla vehicles. There are many other large and small EV charger companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage, but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations.
 
We believe we have competitive advantages over our competitors, such as our long-term contracts with property owners and managers, and our flexible business model where we are able to sell both EV charging stations as well provide access to a leading EV charging network. However, many of our current and expected future competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources than we do, and may leverage those resources to compete effectively.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
State, regional, and local regulations for installation of EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, and certifications as examples. Compliance with such regulation(s) may cause installation delays.
 
Currently, we apply charging fees by the kWh for our services in states that permit this policy and hourly and by session for our services in states that do not permit per kWh pricing. California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Washington have determined that companies that sell EV charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities, therefore, allowing us to charge fees based on kW usage. These individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction; however, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms.
 
Historically, we have secured and depended on incentives, and intend to continue to pursue incentives from various governmental jurisdictions. As an example, in July 2016, the prior White House Administration announced, among other things, programs to:
 

● | Release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Launch the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations; and 

 
We intend to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, loans, rebates, subsidies, and incentives as a cost effective means of reducing our capital investment in the promotion, purchase, and installation of charging stations where applicable. We expect that these incentives, rebates, and tax credits will be critical to our future growth. Additionally, there are incentives that are currently offered to support electric car adoption at the federal, state, and local levels, including a $7,500 federal income tax credit, and rebates/credits in California, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 
As of December 9, 2016, we had 6 patents issued in the U.S., 4 patents issued in Canada, and 4 patents issued in South Korea. These patents relate to various aspects of battery charging and EV charging design. We intend to continue to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. However, our ability to do so may be limited until such time as we are able to generate cash flow from operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in our intellectual property. If we are unable to do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.
