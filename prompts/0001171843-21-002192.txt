ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
RenovaCare, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiary RenovaCare Sciences Corp., “RenovaCare,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,”) was incorporated on July 14, 1983 in the State of Utah under the name Far West Gold, Inc., and changed its domicile to Nevada in 1997. On January 7, 2014, the Company changed its name at the time from “Janus Resources, Inc.” to “RenovaCare, Inc.” so as to more fully reflect its current operations and business and changed its trading symbol from “JANI” to “RCAR” effective as of January 9, 2014.”
 
RenovaCare has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value common stock, of which 87,352,364 shares are outstanding as of December 31, 2020, and 10,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock, of which none are outstanding.
 
Description of Business
 
We are a development-stage biotech and medical device company focusing on the research, development and commercialization of autologous (using a patient's own cells) cellular therapies that can be used for medical and aesthetic applications. We do not have any commercialized products. Our activities have consisted principally of performing research and development activities, business development efforts, and raising capital to support such activities.
 
Treatment of large deep thermal burn wounds has evolved significantly in recent years. While traditional skin grafting was used for decades since the 19th century, over the past 20 years sheets of skin cells grown in vitro and cytokine-treated skin cells applied with mesh matrices have been developed. The newest therapies involve the use of autologous skin cells. We believe RenovaCare’s technology represents a new generation of autologous skin cell therapy that, while still in development may become, if approved, the standard of care.
 
Through RenovaCare Sciences Corp. we own the CellMist™ System, which is comprised of (a) a treatment methodology for cell isolation for the regeneration of human skin cells and other tissues (the “CellMist™ Solution”) and (b) a solution sprayer device (the (SkinGun™”) for delivering cells to the treatment area.
 
In August 2020, we announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conditionally approved the Company’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of autologous skin and pluripotent stem cells rendered by our manual CellMist™ System from donor skin and applied topically with the electronic SkinGun™ spray device for treatment of acute burn wounds. The clinical trial protocol is an open-label single-arm clinical study that will enroll 14 adult human burn subjects with partial-thickness, second-degree thermal burn wounds covering between 10% and 30% total body surface area. The Company expects to conduct the clinical study at four (4) U.S. burn centers commencing in the second quarter of 2021.
 
Our proprietary CellMist™ System, and its component technologies are the subject of six trademarks and applications and over 37 U.S. and international granted or in-process patents in eight patent families. Our patent filings include three granted patents in the United States, two granted international patents, and two allowed international patents, while all in-process patent filings include the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2026 and 2037 and may or may not be the basis for filing continuations. We continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs, and methodologies and processes that we believe may provide us with significant competitive advantages or additional commercial opportunities.
 
The development of our new closed, automated cell isolation device for the CellMistTM System is in the early stage and we anticipate that we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further develop and validate our technology and determine whether a commercially viable product can be developed. Research and development of new technologies involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that our development activities will result in a commercially viable product. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.

The Company has enlisted the assistance of several Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) to manufacture clinical supplies including components of the CellMist System™ and the electronic SkinGun™ spray devices in compliance with FDA’s guidance for current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and Contract Research Organizations (CRO) to test clinical samples and conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an autologous skin cell therapy using the Company’s products to facilitate burn wound healing. These development activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including possible failure of preclinical and clinical testing.
 
We have not generated any revenue and have sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. The Company expects to incur losses as it continues development of its products and technologies and expects that it will need to raise additional capital through partnerships or the sale of its securities to accomplish its business plan. Failing to secure such additional funding before achieving sustainable revenue and profit from operations poses a significant risk. The Company's ability to fund the development of its cellular therapies depends on the amount and timing of cash receipts from future financing activities. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available.
 
Additionally, there is significant uncertainty relating to the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations and capital requirements. Should financing when needed be unavailable or prohibitively expensive or the COVID-19 pandemic continue, it may adversely affect the Company’s ability to (i) retain employees and consultants; (ii) obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all; (iii) delay regulatory submissions and approvals; (iv) delay, limit or preclude the Company from the operation of clinical study sites and testing laboratories; (v) delay, limit or preclude the Company from achieving technology or product development goals, milestones, or objectives; and (vi) preclude or delay entry into joint venture or partnership arrangements. The occurrence of any one or more of such events may affect the Company’s ability to continue on its pathway to commercialization of its technology or products.
 
Our Mission and Strategy
 
Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our CellMistTM System with the SkinGunTM spray device, as next generation cell therapies for burns and other acute and chronic wounds and skin disorders. Before we can do so, however, there are multiple steps we must first take, including:

· | initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the CellMistTM System with the SkinGunTM spray device for treating partial-thickness second-degree thermal burns; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | completing development in validation of our closed, automated cell isolation device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | creating a network of clinical research partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | achieving FDA and/or other regulatory approval and clearance; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanding the range of possible clinical applications for unmet health needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To achieve our goal, we have established the following three strategic priorities:
 

· | Obtain marketing approval and prepare to commercialize our CellMistTM System with the SkinGunTM spray device. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have received conditional approval and we continue to pursue our efforts to secure regulatory (FDA) approval of our IDE in 2020, and if ultimately approved, commence our feasibility study in the United States.
 

· | Selectively pursue strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and licensing opportunities to complement and expand our existing operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to continue to pursue strategic licensing, partnership, and joint venture opportunities. We will continue to target opportunities that will complement our existing technology and operations to create value for stockholders and support our business strategy and mission.
 

· | Secure additional financing as and when required.
--+--------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we will need to pursue financing opportunities, traditional and non-dilutive, in order to raise sufficient capital to fund our ongoing and planned research and development operations. Such financing may or may not be available at acceptable terms or at all.
 
We believe that we have an experienced leadership and scientific team which has come together to achieve our mission of improving the lives of burn patients by creating potentially more effective, safer, efficient, and cost-saving treatments.
 
Our Strategic Collaboration with StemCell Systems
 
In July 2020, we announced the official launch of our new RenovaCare R&D Innovation Center located in Berlin, Germany, where our patented technologies for isolating and spraying self-donated stem cells to regenerate tissues and organs have been under development alongside new product initiatives. Important programs at the Center include preclinical support to our regulatory submissions for our flagship SkinGun™, which delivers a proprietary gentle CellMist™ spray of a patient’s own skin cells on to burns and wounds. The Innovation Center is the result of a multi-year collaboration agreement with StemCell Systems, with whom we have maintained an R&D relationship since 2014.
 
The Innovation Center houses dedicated RenovaCare cell biology laboratories, additional engineering, fabrication, prototyping and performance testing facilities, product design studios, and pilot-scale manufacturing for medical devices and biomedical products. Experienced contract bioengineers, cell biologists, and support staff work under the direction of a team of MD-PhDs who are experts in regenerative medicine, new product development, and clinical translation. Thomas Bold, an inventor of several of our technologies and a long-serving advisor to the Company, leads the Innovation Center and interfaces regularly with our management team. This collaboration has been significant to the development of the CellMist™ System and the SkinGun™ spray device, and will be an important contributor to our future new product development initiatives.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Burns
 
Burns are one of the most common and devastating forms of trauma. Most burn injuries involve layers of the upper skin, the epidermis. Severe major trauma involves a complete loss of the entire thickness of the skin and often requires major surgery involving split-skin mesh-grafting. Skin grafting is a procedure where healthy skin is removed from one area of the body and transplanted to a wound site.
 
Patients with serious thermal injury require immediate specialized definitive care to minimize morbidity and mortality. Data from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in the U.S. show that approximately 2 million fires are reported each year which result in 1.5 million people suffering burn injuries (see American Burn Association Burn Incidence and Treatment in the US: 2014 Fact Sheet, available at: http://www.ameriburn.org). Moderate to severe burn injuries requiring hospitalization account for approximately 50,000 of these cases, and about 5,000 patients die each year in the U.S. from burn-related complications (see Burns injuries on CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/masstrauma/factsheets/public/burns.pdf(2020).
 
The prevalence of patients with severe burns is even higher in emerging economies. For example, according to the World Health Organization over 1,000,000 people in India are moderately to severely burnt every year and approximately 180,000 people worldwide die from burn related injuries (see World Health Organization “Burns: Fact Sheet No. 365,” reviewed March 6, 2018, available at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs365/en/). According to Critical Care, an international clinical medical journal, burns are also among the most expensive traumatic injuries due to long and costly hospitalization, rehabilitation and wound and scar treatment (see Brusselaers, N., Monstrey, et al, “Severe Burn Injury in Europe: A systematic Review of the Incidence, Etiology, Morbidity, and Mortality” available at: http://ccforum.com/content/14/5/R188).
 
Burn injuries account for a significant cost to the health care system in North America and worldwide. In the U.S. there are currently 132 centers specializing in burn care. Recent estimates in the U.S. show that 150,000 patients are admitted annually for definitive care treatment of burn injuries, and over 60% of the estimated U.S. acute hospitalizations related to burn injury were admitted to burn centers. Such centers now average over 200 annual admissions each for burn injury and skin disorders requiring similar treatment. The other 4,500 U.S. acute care hospitals average less than 3 burn admissions each per year (see American Burn Association Burn Incidence and Treatment in the US: 2013 Fact Sheet, available at: http://www.ameriburn.org).
 
According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the annual costs for the treatment of burns is $1.5 billion, with another $5 billion in costs associated with lost work (see https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb217-Burn-Hospital-Stays-ED-Visits-2013.pdf). Initial hospitalization costs and physicians' fees for specialized care of a patient with a major burn injury are currently estimated to be $200,000. Overall, costs escalate for major burn cases because of repeated admissions for reconstruction and rehabilitation therapy. In the U.S., current annual estimates show that more than $18 billion is spent on specialized care of patients with major burn injuries (see Church D, Elsayed S, Reid O, Winston B, Lindsay R “Burn wound infections” Clinical Microbiology Reviews 2006;19(2):403–34, available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1471990).

Wounds
 
According to The Wall Street Journal, 6.5 million people are affected by chronic wounds, and $25 billion is spent annually on treating chronic wounds on patients in the U.S. alone (see Järbrink, Krister et al. “Prevalence and incidence of chronic wounds and related complications: a protocol for a systematic review.” Systematic reviews vol. 5,1 152. 8 Sep. 2016 doi:10.1186/s13643-016-0329-y).
 
The Wound Care Market Global Forecast to 2024 report issued by Markets & Markets states that in 2019, advanced wound care products accounted for the largest share of the total market and is expected to have the highest growth, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 4.6% to 2024. Major factors driving the growth of this market of hard-to-heal wounds are an increase in an aging population and greater prevalence of chronic disease, including diabetes and obesity. The development of regenerative medicine and healing capabilities allow for more effective treatment, quicker healing and improved health economic outcomes.
 
The healthcare facilities (hospitals and clinics) segment accounted for the largest market share in 2019 as these systems are used for critical cases, improve quality of care for patients, and have the infrastructure and resources to support treatment.


Our Technology
 
Our CellMist System is comprised of the CellMistTM cell suspension derived by enzymatic digestion of a patient’s own skin tissue applied topically with our proprietary electronic SkinGunTM spray device to deliver a fine single-cell mist onto the patient’s burn wound.
 
The duration of the entire cell isolation and cell spraying procedure is approximately 1.5–2 hours. Published studies show that within days following the wound treatment procedure, complete wound closure occurs, and the skin cells generate a protective skin layer (re-epithelialization), and within weeks the skin regains its function, color and texture.
 
Our cell isolation and cell spraying procedure occur on the same day, in an on-site hospital setting. Because the skin cells sprayed using the SkinGunTM spray device are actually the patient's own cells, the skin that is regenerated looks more natural than other skin replacement technologies. During recovery, the skin cells grow into fully functional skin layers, and the regenerated skin leaves minimal scarring in observational case studies. Additionally, our methods require substantially smaller donor areas than skin grafting, reducing donor area burden such as pain and the risk of complications.
 
In August 2019, the Company was awarded a patent continuation, allowing the SkinGunTM spray device to be used to spray all varieties of tissues and cells, thus opening the door for its potential application in the regeneration of tissues and organs, beyond skin.
 
In November 2020, the Company was issued two new patents encompassing improvements to the SkinGun™, expanding its potential application beyond the surgical setting into the field, and allowing the use of liquid suspension solutions to include drugs, hormones, and other useful agents.
 
The CellMistTM System for which patient applications were submitted on the closed, automated cell isolation device to the USPTO in December 2020, remains an experimental, unproven methodology and we continue to evaluate its safety and efficacy. There is no guarantee that we will be able to develop a commercially viable product based upon the CellMistTM System and its underlying technology.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology, medical device, and wound care industries are characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Our CellMistTM System competes with a variety of companies in the wound care markets, many of which offer substantially different treatments for similar problems.
 
Most of our competitors are larger, established companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than those available to us. Additionally, many of our present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions addressed by our products, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our competitors. Our closest direct competitor with its own skin cell therapy for burn wounds, received FDA approval in September 2018 and launched its product in 2019; however, we believe, our next generation skin cell therapy for burn wounds has multiple notable advantages including more cell types from both epidermal and dermal layers of the skin; greater cell yield and viability; smaller ratio of donor tissue to burn wound area; greater burn wound coverage; and single cells applied with the SkinGun™ spray device that rapidly adhere to the burn wound.

The Company and its direct competitor have autologous skin cell therapies that facilitate the healing of deep partial-thickness second-degree thermal burn wounds. However, there are notable differences between these our competitor’s therapy products compared to our CellMistTM System, including product configuration, processes for cell isolation from donor skin, topical administration of isolated skin cells, burn wound coverage, and duration of patented intellectual property (IP), as enumerated below:
 

· | RenovaCare’s CellMist™ System in development utilizes a closed, automated cell isolation process, whereas existing cell therapy products utilize a manual process. We believe our closed, automated process will be easier to use and reproducible for the burn care center end-user. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The RenovaCare cell isolation process in development employs a sequential animal-free multi-enzyme process to isolate skin cells and pluripotent stem cells from both epidermal and dermal layers of donor skin tissues. Existing therapy isolates skin cells with a single animal-origin enzyme on the epidermal layer only. Significantly more cells and key cell types are afforded by our multi-enzyme process. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RenovaCare uses the electronic SkinGun™ spray device to administer the skin cell suspension topically as a single-cell, fine mist on to burn wounds in an evenly, distributed comprehensive pattern, in contrast, existing therapy uses a corrugated plastic nozzle affixed onto a syringe to spray or drip cells and cell clumps onto the burn wound, which must be positioned to allow the cell suspension to roll onto the wound. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The CellMist™ System and SkinGun™ deliver single skin cells as compared to cell clumps, which enhance reepithelization and wound closure. This gentle fine mist maintains cell viability that affords rapid cell adherence without dripping and rapid cell proliferation to cover the wound, a distinct advantage over existing therapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The donor skin tissue to burn wound ratio of the RenovaCare product is > 1:100 providing coverage of burn wounds at 10%-30% total body surface area (TBSA), whereas our competitor’s ratio is 1:80 with coverage <20% TBSA. A practical result is that a single kit from RenovaCare may cover 30% TBSA burn wounds, as compared to multiple kits needed for 20% TBSA burn wounds by our competitor. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RenovaCare IP which extends through 2037 has a considerably longer life than that of our competitors.

Intellectual Property
 
In the course of conducting our business, we from time to time create inventions. Obtaining, maintaining, and protecting our inventions, including seeking patent protection, might be important depending on the nature of the invention. To that end, we seek to implement patent and other intellectual property strategies to appropriately protect our intellectual property. While we file and prosecute patent applications to protect our inventions, our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of patents or issued patents might not provide competitive advantages. Also, our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology.
 
The scope, enforceability and effective term of issued patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country, and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries, so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country. The patents we obtain and the unpatented proprietary technology we hold might not afford us significant commercial protection or advantage.
 
Our proprietary CellMist™ System and its component technologies were the subject of six trademarks and applications and over 37 U.S. and international granted or in-process patents in eight patent families. Our patent filings include three granted patents in the United States, two granted international patents, and two allowed international patents, while all in-process patent filings include the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2026 and 2037 and may or may not be the basis for filing continuations. We continually assess opportunities to seek patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs, and methodologies and processes that we believe may provide us with significant competitive advantages or additional commercial opportunities.

In addition to issued patents describe above, we plan to file additional patent applications that, if issued, would provide further protection for The CellMistTM System. Although we believe the bases for these patents and patent applications are sound, they are untested; and there is no assurance that they will not be successfully challenged. There can be no assurance that any patent previously issued will be of commercial value, that any patent applications will result in issued patents of commercial value, or that our technology will not be held to infringe patents held by others.
 
Domestic Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products or devices such as those we are attempting to develop. Our device candidates, to the extent they are developed, will likely be subject to pre-market approval by the FDA prior to their marketing for commercial use in the U.S., and to any approvals required by foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing outside the U.S. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, and may require the submission of a new application or amendment to an existing premarket approval (“PMA”) or 510(k) waiver application in the U.S. for pre-market approval, or for foreign regulatory approvals outside the U.S. The process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain.
Premarket Approval
 
We may be required to file a premarket authorization (“PMA”) application for any other device that we commercialize if it is deemed a Class III medical device. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices, which are novel devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in order to obtain marketing clearance.
 
PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. The applicant must receive FDA approval of its PMA application prior to marketing the device. PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). An approved PMA is, in effect, a license granting the applicant (or owner) permission to market the device.
 
To obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device, a pre-market notification to the FDA must be submitted demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or Class II predicate device. For a new device to be found “substantially equivalent” to one or other legally marketed predicate devices, the new device must have: 1) the same intended use as a predicate, and 2) either a) the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or b) different technological characteristics, but the information submitted must not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and must demonstrate substantial equivalence. We believe that we may be eligible to obtain 510(k) clearance for each of our Electronic SkinGun, Disposable SkinGun and Cell Isolation Devices for certain uses.
 
Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”)
 
On August 5, 2020 the FDA granted conditional approval of the Company’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of autologous skin and stem cells rendered by its CellMist™ System from donor skin and applied topically with the SkinGun™ spray device for treatment of burn wounds.
 
Among the data required in a PMA application is human clinical test data. The FDA’s regulation that governs the human testing is the IDE and other patient protection regulations. For devices that are considered Significant Risk, an IDE application is required. It consists of the proposed clinical protocol and all supporting study documentation and must be submitted and approved by the FDA and an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to initiation of the human testing. Since the CellMistTM System employs the use of skin and stem cells taken from the patient, it is considered Significant Risk by the FDA; therefore, we are required to file an IDE application prior to conducting a clinical study for any application, such as for treatment of severe burns. The FDA has a specified review timeline and process for IDE reviews - each review phase takes 30 days and if the FDA has questions or concerns about the study design, there may be multiple review rounds until the FDA either: (a) conditionally approves, (b) approves or (c) denies approval of the clinical study conduct under the submitted IDE. There is no guarantee that any IDE application we submit will be approved by the FDA. We received conditional IDE approval in August 2020 to conduct a safety and feasibility study of the CellMist System in 14 subjects, to be conducted in four burn centers in the U.S.

HIPAA Requirements
 
Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with any research activities we conduct. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. These activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.
International Regulation
 
The regulation of any potential product candidates outside of the U.S. will be subject to the applicable laws and requirements of the specific country or countries in which we are introducing our product candidates.
 
Some countries regulate human tissue products as a biological product, which would require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates. Other countries may classify our product candidates as human tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale; other countries may have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to potential product candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet. The validation testing and manufacturing of our medical devices are subject to ISO9000 and other industry regulations.
 
Employees 
 
We currently have 2 full time and two part time employees. We also have a number of industry consultants who provide services on a fractional time or on an as needed basis. We also have one consultant, based in Spain, who provides services on a full-time basis. See “ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE--Directors Executive Officers and Non-Executive Officers” for further discussion.
