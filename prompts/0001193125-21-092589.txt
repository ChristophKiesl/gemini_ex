Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics for patients suffering from rare and aggressive cancers, primarily in genetically defined patient populations. Our differentiated development approach is predicated on identifying and addressing tumorigenic drivers of cancer, through a combination of our bioinformatics platform and next-generation sequencing to deliver targeted therapies to underserved patient populations. Our current portfolio of product candidates, AL101 and AL102, targets the aberrant activation of the Notch pathway using gamma secretase inhibitors. Gamma secretase is the enzyme responsible for Notch activation and, when inhibited, turns off the Notch pathway activation. Aberrant activation of the Notch pathway has long been implicated in multiple solid tumor and hematological cancers and has often been associated with more aggressive cancers. In cancers, Notch is known to serve as a critical facilitator in processes such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and metastatic spread, all of which contribute to a poorer patient prognosis. AL101 and AL102 are designed to address the underlying key drivers of tumor growth, and our initial Phase 2 clinical data of AL101 suggest that our approach may address shortcomings of existing treatment options. We believe that our novel product candidates, if approved, have the potential to transform treatment outcomes for patients suffering from rare and aggressive cancers. 
 Our product candidates, AL101 and AL102, are being developed as potent, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitors, or GSIs. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize AL101 and AL102 from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, in November 2017. BMS evaluated AL101 in three Phase 1 studies involving more than 200 total subjects and AL102 in a single Phase 1 study involving 36 subjects with various cancers who had not been prospectively characterized for Notch activation, and to whom we refer to as unselected subjects. While these Phase 1 studies did not report statistically significant overall results, clinical activity was observed across these studies in cancers in which Notch has been implicated as a tumorigenic driver. 
 We are currently evaluating AL101 as a monotherapy in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma, or R/M ACC, for patients bearing Notch-activating mutations. We refer to this trial as the ACCURACY trial. We use next-generation sequencing, or NGS, to identify patients with Notch-activating mutations, an approach that we believe will enable us to target the patient population with cancers that we believe are most likely to respond to and benefit from AL101 treatment. We chose to initially target R/M ACC based on our differentiated approach, which is comprised of: data generated in a Phase 1 study of AL101 in unselected, heavily pretreated subjects conducted by BMS, our own data generated in patient-derived xenograft models, our bioinformatics platform and our expertise in the Notch pathway. 
 ACC is a rare malignancy of the secretory glands, most commonly of the salivary glands. It has an annual incidence of approximately 3,400 patients in the United States, approximately 1,700 of whom are R/M ACC patients. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for patients with R/M ACC. Based on scientific literature and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that 18% to 22% of R/M ACC patients have Notch-activating mutations. These Notch patients have a significantly worse prognosis, with estimated overall median survival rates roughly four times shorter than patients without Notch-activating mutations. According to published data from 31 Phase 2 clinical trials in ACC conducted since 2005 using a variety of treatment modalities, these treatments showed limited or no clinical activity in unselected ACC subjects. The objective response rates, or ORR, in 30 of these trials, ranged from 0% to 20%, with a 47% ORR observed in one trial conducted in China. In 15 of the 31 trials, a 0% ORR was observed. ORR includes subjects who displayed either a complete response, or CR, or a partial response, or PR. 
 We are currently conducting our ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY trial for the treatment of R/M ACC in subjects with progressive disease and Notch-activating mutations. Our interim data from the ACCURACY trial are as of July 30, 2020, and include safety data from 45 subjects and efficacy data from 40 subjects as of the date of the first radiographic scan, all of whom are in the 4 mg arm of the trial. As of July 30, 2020, AL101, which was generally well tolerated with manageable side effects, showed a 68% disease control rate (total subjects who displayed either a response or stable disease), with an unconfirmed 15% ORR. A confirmed response is a response observed in two or more scans, an unconfirmed response that may potentially be confirmed is a response observed in only one scan for a patient who remains on trial and an unconfirmed response that will remain unconfirmed is a response observed in only one scan for a patient who has left the trial. This unconfirmed 15% ORR included no CRs and six PRs (three confirmed PRs and three unconfirmed PRs that will remain unconfirmed) and 53% of subjects displaying stable disease, or SD. If approved, we believe that AL101 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/M ACC and address the unmet medical need of these patients. AL101 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in May 2019 for the treatment of ACC and fast track designation in February 2020 for the treatment of R/M ACC. In the second quarter of 2020, we commenced dosing of patients in our ACCURACY trial for the treatment of R/M ACC with Notch-activating mutations at the higher dose of 6 mg. We plan to report additional data from this trial in 2021. 
 We are currently also evaluating AL101 as a monotherapy in an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Notch-activated R/M triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC. We refer to this trial as the TENACITY trial. It is an open-label, multicenter, single arm study which is expected to initially enroll up to 26 patients with Notch-activated R/M TNBC whose disease has recurred or progressed after three or fewer lines of prior therapy. Notch activation will be determined using a Next Generation Sequencing, or NGS, based assay screen. We dosed the first patient to this study in January 2021 and expect to report preliminary data by the end of 2021. 
 TNBC is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. Breast cancer, which has an annual incidence of approximately 270,000 patients in the United States, is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 10% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with TNBC, which is associated with a younger age and more advanced stage at diagnosis, increased risk of visceral metastasis and decreased survival. Approximately 37% of TNBC patients have 
 
5 


  R/M TNBC, resulting in an annual incidence of approximately 10,000 R/M TNBC patients in the United States. Based on primary literature and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that approximately 9% to 16% of R/M TNBC patients have Notch-activating gene alterations including mutations and fusions. In the Phase 1 study of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy in heavily pretreated subjects, which included 22 TNBC subjects, a CR was observed in one TNBC subject, PRs were observed in seven TNBC subjects and SD was observed in five TNBC subjects. Based on these findings and supporting data from our own patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models, we commenced our Phase 2 TENACITY clinical trial of AL101 as a monotherapy for the treatment of R/M TNBC in patients with Notch-activating mutations. 
 Our second product candidate, AL102, is being developed as a potent, selective, oral GSI for the treatment of desmoid tumors, for which we have recently announced that the FDA has agreed, based on data from AL101 and AL102 Phase 1 studies including durable responses observed in patients with desmoid tumors, to proceed with a Phase 2/3 pivotal study, which can potentially be used as a registrational study. 
 Desmoid tumors are rare, disfiguring and often debilitating types of soft tissue tumors. Desmoid tumors have an annual incidence of approximately 1,700 patients in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for patients with desmoid tumors. Given the slowly progressive nature of the disease, we believe these patients will be best served by an oral therapy. BMS conducted a Phase 1 study of AL102 in 36 unselected, heavily pretreated subjects. While this Phase 1 study did not report statistically significant overall results, the study included one subject with desmoid tumors who was observed to have SD for over six months. In a separate Phase 1 study of AL101, three Desmoid subjects were included, and two of these subjects had partial responses and have continued treatment in a post-trial expanded access protocol, and both maintained their responses, and one subject had stable disease. We believe that GSIs have the potential to treat patients with desmoid tumors based on data the data we have obtained to date. 
 The pivotal Phase 2/3 RINGSIDE trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AL102 in adult and adolescent patients with desmoid tumors. Part A of the study will be open-label and will enroll up to 36 patients with progressive desmoid tumors in three study arms across three doses of AL102: 1.2 mg daily, or QD, 2 mg twice weekly, or QIW, and 4 mg twice weekly, or QIW with initial follow up of safety, tolerability and tumor volume by MRI after 16 weeks in order to determine the optimal dose. At the end of part A, all patients will be eligible to enroll into an open label extension study at the selected dose where long-term efficacy and safety will be monitored. 
 Part B of the study will start immediately after dose selection from part A and will be a double-blind placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 156 patients with progressive disease, randomized 2:1 between AL102 or placebo. The studys primary endpoint will be progression free survival, or PFS with secondary endpoints including ORR, duration of response, or DOR and patient reported Quality of Life, or QOL measures. 
 The study is expected to commence in the first half of 2021 with an initial interim data read-out from part A and dose selection expected by mid-2022 with part B of the study to commence immediately thereafter. 
 We are also developing AL101 for the treatment of T-ALL, an aggressive, rare form of T-cell specific leukemia. T-ALL has an annual incidence of approximately 1,200 patients in the United States, of which an estimated 400 patients, including pediatric patients, present for the treatment of relapsed/refractory, or R/R, T-ALL. Approximately 65% of all R/R T-ALL patients have Notch-activating mutations. In addition, there is an incremental subset of patients with Notch pathway activation who do not bear Notch-activating mutations. R/R T-ALL is characterized by chemotherapy resistance, induction failure and tendency for early relapse, as 55% of adult patients and 20% of pediatric patients will relapse following first-line therapy. In the Phase 1 study of AL101, which included 26 unselected, heavily pretreated evaluable T-ALL subjects treated with 4 mg or 6 mg dose levels, a CR was observed in two T-ALL subjects and a PR was observed in one T-ALL subject. Of the three T-ALL subjects who displayed a response, two had a confirmed Notch-activating mutation. Based on these findings and supporting data from our preclinical studies, we intend to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of AL101 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL in 2022, subject to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. 
 In addition, we are collaborating with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited, or Novartis, to develop AL102 for the treatment of multiple myeloma, or MM, in combination with Novartis B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, targeting therapies. We granted Novartis the exclusive ability to evaluate, develop and potentially license and commercialize AL102 exclusively as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of MM. Novartis conducted a preclinical study evaluating AL102 alone and in combination with Novartis bi-specific antibody. Using a cell line model of human MM, Novartis study showed that treatment with AL102 resulted in an approximate 20-fold increase in the levels of cell surface expression of BCMA. Furthermore, using human MM cells from donors, Novartis study showed that AL102 enhanced BCMA-CD3 bi-specific antibody redirected t-cell cytotoxicity activity in vitro. We believe that the clinical activity of BCMA-targeting agents may also be enhanced in clinical trials when used in combination with a GSI such as AL102. 
 Our product candidates have been or are being evaluated in clinical trials at leading oncology centers across the United States, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Massachusetts General Hospital, and in centers in Canada, Israel and Europe. 
 The following chart summarizes our current portfolio of product candidates:

Our History and Team 
 We were founded in November 2017 when we acquired an exclusive, worldwide license to AL101 (previously called BMS-906024) and AL102 (previously called BMS-986115), from BMS. We have assembled a team with extensive experience in building and operating clinical and commercial organizations, particularly in oncology and rare diseases. Our Chief Executive Officer, Roni Mamluk, Ph.D., has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and has led our business since its inception. Our Chief Medical Officer, Gary Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., is an oncologist with clinical research experience from John Hopkins School of Medicine and in oncology drug development roles at AbbVie, Inc. Dr. Gordon was involved in the development and commercialization plans for venetoclax, celecoxib and veliparib. Members of our management team have held leadership positions at companies that have successfully discovered, acquired, developed and commercialized therapies for a range of rare diseases and cancers, including Chiasma Inc., Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc., AbbVie Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Protalix Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize therapies that improve treatment outcomes for patients with aggressive cancers. The key elements of our strategy are: 
 

 | Rapidly advance the clinical development of AL101 for the treatment of R/M ACC. We are currently conducting our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial of AL101 for the treatment of R/M ACC. Our interim data from the 4 mg dosing group of our clinical trial as of July 30, 2020 showed encouraging initial signs of activity. We expect to report further results from this trial in a medical conference in 2021. AL101 was granted Orphan Drug Designation in May 2019 for the treatment of ACC and fast track designation in February 2020 for the treatment of R/M ACC. If approved, we believe that AL101 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/M ACC. We may also seek regulatory approval of AL101 for the treatment of R/M ACC selectively in other territories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapidly advance the clinical development of AL101 for the treatment of R/M TNBC. We are currently conducting our Phase 2 TENACITY trial of AL101 for the treatment of R/M TNBC. We dosed the first patient in this study in January 2021 and expect to report preliminary data by the end of 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapidly advance the clinical development of AL102 for the treatment of desmoid tumors. We intend to commence the Phase 2/3 RINGSIDE pivotal study, which could potentially be used as a registrational study, evaluating AL102 for the treatment of desmoid tumors in the first half of 2021. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for patients with desmoid tumors. We also intend to evaluate other indications in which we believe AL102 could potentially deliver substantial benefits to patients.

 | Advance the clinical development of AL101 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL. In parallel with R/M ACC and R/M TNBC, we are committed to developing AL101 in additional indications with a high unmet medical need and in which Notch-activating mutations are known to be a tumorigenic driver, such as T-ALL. We intend to commence Phase 2 clinical trials of AL101 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL in 2022, subject to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. We also intend to evaluate other indications in which we believe AL101 could potentially deliver substantial benefits to patients.

 | Collaborate with select diagnostic developers to identify and expand our addressable patient population. Consistent with our targeted approach to oncology, our development strategy is based on using companion diagnostics to identify and expand patient populations with Notch-activating mutations. Commercially available diagnostic tests are limited in their ability to test for all potential Notch-activating mutations. To address this, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Tempus to use their assay to assist in patient selection in our clinical trials, and that is designed to detect across all four Notch genes and a wider range of Notch gene rearrangements than what is possible with commercially available diagnostic tests today.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Commercialize our product candidates, if approved, to address the unmet medical need of underserved patient populations with rare and aggressive cancers. We intend to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, by building our own specialized sales and marketing organization initially in the United States. We believe our target market can be addressed by a small number of dedicated marketing and medical sales specialists covering specialized oncologists treating the target patient population. We may also selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Evaluate strategic collaborations to maximize the potential of our portfolio. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our portfolio of product candidates through in-licensing, acquisition and other collaboration opportunities to jointly develop product candidates and maximize the value of our company. We have already established a collaboration with Novartis to develop AL102 in combination with Novartis BCMA-targeting therapies for the treatment of MM and intend to assess other collaboration opportunities by leveraging our novel GSI technology.

Our Product Candidates 
 The Role of the Notch Pathway 
 The Notch pathway has long been implicated in multiple solid tumor and hematological cancers, and often has been associated with more aggressive cancers. Notch receptors serve as critical facilitators in processes such as cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and metastatic spread, which all contribute to a poorer prognosis. Humans have four Notch receptors, known as Notch 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as five transmembrane-bound ligands. Different forms of cancer are associated with different types of Notch mutations. 
Normal and Tumorigenic Signaling of Notch 
 

As seen on the left side of the above graphic, normal Notch receptor signaling is initiated by the binding of a ligand expressed on an adjacent cell, which triggers a conformational change, permitting cleavage of the Notch receptor by the g-secretase complex. As seen on the right side of the above graphic, this cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain, or NICD, which then translocates to the cell nucleus, interacts with transcription complexes and promotes the transcription of downstream target genes that regulate critical cell functions. This pathway activation is terminated by the degradation of NICD. Activating mutations in the Notch receptor lead to accumulation of the NICD and hyper-activation of the pathway, resulting in excess NICD. Hyper-activation of the Notch pathway promotes cellular proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, drug resistance and metastatic spread, which are each hallmarks of cancer.

 Our Potent and Selective Investigational Gamma Secretase Inhibitors 
 We are developing targeted therapies designed to address the underlying key drivers of tumor growth in patients where GSI inhibition of the Notch pathway may lead to clinical benefit. Our current portfolio of product candidates targets the aberrant activation of the Notch pathway with GSIs. Gamma secretase is the enzyme responsible for Notch activation and, when inhibited, blocks the expression of Notch gene targets by blocking the final cleavage step required for Notch activation, thereby turning off the aberrant activation of the Notch pathway. We have designed our GSIs to selectively inhibit all four Notch receptors. 
Our Bioinformatics Platform 
 We have developed a proprietary bioinformatics platform to analyze NGS data and identify patients in whom Notch is a tumorigenic driver. We apply our big-data analysis capabilities to identify and confirm patients with Notch-activating mutations who are likely sensitive to GSIs. 
 The first step in our bioinformatics process is to gather evidence from literature and identify indications in which Notch is a known tumorigenic driver. We then confirm there are a requisite number of patients with Notch alterations in a specific indication using our proprietary database to integrate genetic information from thousands of unidentified patients. We couple these methods with our analysis of PDX models, which allow us to assess the sensitivity of the tumors in vivo with Notch-activating mutations, for certain indications. 
 Our bioinformatics platform includes: 
 

 | Our Ayala Cancer Omics Research Database, or ACORD, which is used to collate NGS data and integrate Notch-activating mutations from approximately 250,000 patients with over 400 different forms of cancer and harbors approximately 27,000 unique Notch alterations. We continue to expand ACORD by gaining access to additional sources of NGS data and scientific literature. We believe that we possess the largest database of Notch-activating mutations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Open source and proprietary algorithms integrated into a dedicated software platform, resulting in over 20 specialized data processing pipelines. These algorithms transform DNA and RNA sequences into searchable parameters, including which cancers harbor potential Notch-activating mutations. A systems biology approach is then applied to explore pathways involved in drug resistance and inform the design of our future clinical trial designs and to consider potential treatment combinations and responses to GSI.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our scientists continue to utilize unique capabilities in bioinformatics and functional biology to create a Notch-focused patient identification engine that we believe will result in the discovery of additional patients with currently undetected Notch-activating mutations. 
 Expanding Our Addressable Patient Population 
 In addition to the well-known scientific literature supporting Notchs tumorigenic role in various forms of cancer, we are developing our bioinformatics platform to potentially discover additional genetic alterations not currently covered in commercially available genetic screening panels. Currently available NGS tests only cover certain areas of Notch genes on the DNA level, however, we believe that there is no single test that covers all four Notch genes on the DNA and RNA level. As a result, these tests are able to detect only a subset of the patients with Notch-activating mutations. In order to develop a diagnostic test that can detect the full breadth of Notch-activating mutations on both the DNA and RNA level, we plan to collaborate with leading diagnostics companies to improve the testing capabilities for Notch-activating mutations. For example, we have a collaboration agreement with Tempus to use their assays to assist with patient selection for our future clinical trials and detect a wider range of Notch gene rearrangements than commercially available NGS tests. 
 We estimate that there are up to 12,000 newly diagnosed patients annually across the United States, Europe and Japan who have Notch pathway activation in the indications that we are currently targeting. 
 Our Novel Approach: AL101 and AL102 
 Differentiated GSI for the Treatment of Rare Cancers 
 AL101 and AL102 are potent and selective small molecule GSIs designed to inhibit the aberrant activation of the Notch pathway. In preclinical studies and three Phase 1 studies conducted by BMS, tumor responses were observed in cancers we are initially targeting and where Notch is known to be an important tumorigenic driver. Our further investigation using PDX models provided additional evidence supporting our targeted patient population development approach. 
 In preclinical studies, both AL101 and AL102 inhibited all four Notch genes at low concentrations, when compared to other GSIs either currently or previously under development as illustrated in the below graphic.

 The Notch cell-based transactivation assay was based on the ability of the released NICD to function as a transcription factor with other nuclear factors. Luciferase reporter activity provided a measure of the antagonism of Notch transcriptional activity. HeLa cervical cancer cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids containing truncated Notch 14 receptors and a luciferase reporter vector. The cells were tested for Notch-activity in the absence or presence of GSIs at increasing concentrations. These data represent the GSI concentration inhibiting luciferase assay by 50%, or IC50. Lower concentrations correlate to more potent GSIs. As highlighted in the above graphic, AL101 and AL102 generally reached IC50 across all four Notch receptors at concentrations lower than other GSIs either currently or previously under development, which displayed the potency of AL101 and AL102 and supported the continued clinical development of these product candidates.

 Furthermore, as shown in the graphs above, AL101s stronger inhibition of tumor growth was observed in T-ALL mouse models when compared to other GSI molecules. We believe that AL101 and AL102, if approved, are GSIs with the potential to address the unmet medical need for patients with rare and aggressive tumors. 
 AL101 for the Treatment of R/M Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma 
 Disease Background 
 ACC is a rare solid tumor malignancy of secretory glands including the salivary glands. While major salivary glands are located in the mouth, minor salivary glands are scattered throughout the aerodigestive tract and are mostly concentrated in cheeks, lips, tongue, palate and floor of the mouth. ACC can also arise in other sites outside the head and neck. When presenting in the major salivary glands, ACC can cause symptoms of varying severity, including numbness, difficulty swallowing or paralysis of a facial nerve. 
 
10 


 ACC is characterized by its high recurrence rate and, along with its persistent and relentless progressive course, often manifests as local recurrences and late-onset distant metastasis. ACC has an annual incidence of approximately 3,400 patients in the United States, approximately 1,700 of which are R/M ACC patients. Based on primary literature and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that 18% to 22% of R/M ACC patients have Notch-activating mutations. 
 Notch Is a Tumorigenic Driver in ACC and 
 Correlates with a Distinct Pattern of Metastases and Poor Prognosis 
 

Median RFS = 12.5 vs 33.9 months (p=0.01) | Median OS = 29.6 vs 121.9 months (p=0.001)

Data from MD Anderson Cancer Center 
 As the understanding of the biology of cancer and ACC specifically evolved, the importance of the Notch pathway and Notch-activating mutations was established. A recent publication from MD Anderson Cancer Center examined the relationship between Notch-activating mutations and ACC patient prognosis in 102 subjects, as illustrated in the figures above. The figure on the left shows that the relapse free survival, or time from diagnosis to relapse, was reduced from 33.9 months for Notch 1 wild-type, or WT, patients to 12.5 months for Notch 1 mutant patients. In addition, patients with Notch-activating mutations were more likely to present with advanced-stage disease and they developed a somewhat different pattern of metastatic disease compared to Notch 1 WT patients. Similarly, the graphic on the right demonstrates that median overall survival was reduced from 121.9 months for Notch 1 WT patients to 29.6 months for Notch 1 mutant patients. Similar results were subsequently observed in an additional retrospective study analyzing data from 84 ACC subjects at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where median overall survival was reduced from 204.5 months for Notch 1 WT patients to 55.1 months for Notch 1 mutant patients. 
Current Treatment Landscape 
 The current standard of care is typically surgery followed by radiation. Radiation or systemic therapy, comprised of chemotherapy and targeted drugs, may be recommended if the tumor cannot be surgically removed or in cases of advanced metastatic disease. There are limited systemic therapy treatment options, and no FDA-approved therapies, available for patients with R/M ACC. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, or SEER, the relative survival rate for all ACC patients in the United States between 1975 and 2016 was 81% at five years and 66% at ten years. Treatment has been particularly ineffective for ACC patients with metastatic disease, where survival rates are much lower: 33% at five years and 24% at ten years. According to published data from 31 Phase 2 clinical trials in ACC conducted since 2005 using a variety of treatment modalities, these treatments showed limited or no clinical activity in unselected ACC subjects. The ORR in 30 of these trials ranged from 0% to 20%, with a 47% ORR observed in one trial conducted in China. In 15 of the 31 trials, a 0% ORR was observed. Accordingly, there remains a lack of effective treatment options for patients with R/M ACC. 
 Our Proposed Solution for R/M ACC: AL101 
 We are developing AL101 as a potent, selective and injectable small molecule GSI for patients with R/M ACC with Notch-activating mutations and we believe that AL101 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved therapy for this patient population. 
 Our Ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY Trial:
We are currently evaluating subjects in our ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY trial of AL101 as a monotherapy for the treatment of R/M ACC. Our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center study of AL101 administered intravenously, or IV, in subjects with ACC bearing Notch-activating mutations who have previously been treated for or are newly diagnosed with metastatic disease. We dosed 45 subjects as of July 30, 2020 and we expect to dose a total of approximately 90 subjects. 
 
11 


 The primary endpoint of our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial is the objective response rate as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, 1.1, a commonly used set of measures for evaluating the response of solid tumors to treatment, with confirmation by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate by investigator review, duration of response and progression-free survival by an independent review committee and an investigator review, overall survival, safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics, or PK. The Phase 2 ACCURACY trial is powered to assess statistical significance for these endpoints. However, the Phase 2 ACCURACY trial is ongoing and formal statistical testing will not be performed until the study is complete. 
 Part 1 of the trial includes dosing a maximum of 45 subjects at 4 mg of AL101 IV once weekly and was fully enrolled as of July 30, 2020. Stage 2 of the trial will include dosing of an additional 42 subjects at 6 mg of AL101 IV once weekly. We are currently enrolling in the 6 mg dose cohort arm and we look forward to providing further trial progress updates in 2021. Per study protocol, dosing will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent for treatment by a subject. 
 Ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY Trial Interim Clinical Data
Our interim data from the 4 mg dosing group of our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial as of July 30, 2020 showed early signs of clinical activity. As of July 30, 2020, 40 subjects were evaluable for a response using RECIST 1.1. No CRs were observed, three confirmed and three unconfirmed PRs (which will remain unconfirmed were observed in six subjects, and SD was observed in 21 subjects, yielding a 68% disease control rate among the evaluable subjects. All six subjects with either confirmed or unconfirmed PRs had received prior radiation therapy and four subjects had received prior systemic chemotherapy. As of July 30, 2020, three of the evaluable subjects remain on therapy. 
 The best objective responses observed in our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial, as determined by the investigator and measured by RECIST 1.1, are shown in the following graph, by individual subject. The dotted lines under the x-axis represent cutoffs for PR, defined as a 30% or greater reduction in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions for RECIST 1.1 or, for bone-only disease patients, a 50% or greater reduction in lesion size for the MD Anderson modified bone response criteria. Progressive disease is defined as a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameters. Stable disease is reflected between the dotted lines at 20% and -30%.Best Objective Responses by Investigator Review (n=40)a

Subject #35 
 

We have observed subjects who showed response following their first radiographic exam at eight weeks after treatment. We believe that these interim results provide evidence supporting continue development of AL101 as a monotherapy for patients with R/M ACC. We expect to release additional interim results from our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial at a medical conference in 2021. 
 Phase 2 ACCURACY Trial Interim Safety Results
AL101 was generally observed to be well tolerated in the interim data as of July 30, 2020, with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. All subjects experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event, or TRAE, while approximately 20% experienced a Grade 3 or 4 TRAE. In addition, seven subjects experienced a total of eight treatment-related serious adverse events, or TRSAEs. The eight TRSAEs included two Grade 2 infusion reactions, one Grade 1 keratoacanthoma, one Grade 3 aspartate aminnotransferase increase, one Grade 3 pneumonia, one Grade 3 decreased appetite, one Grade 3 transient ischemic attack (TIA) and one Grade 4 hyponatremia. Eight subjects had a dose reduction from 4 mg to 2.4 mg, six of which were within two weeks of an adverse event. There were 17 dose interruptions resulting in delays of at least one week due to adverse events, most of which were no more than two weeks in length. Five subjects began treatment but discontinued before their first post-dose radiographic evaluation. Of these five subjects, one subject discontinued due to an infusion reaction, one due to pneumonia, two subjects discontinued due to non-treatment related adverse events and one subject stopped treatment without a first follow-up radiographic evaluation. Therefore, these five subjects were considered non-evaluable for efficacy. There were four deaths within 30 days of stopping AL101 treatment, which were assessed by the investigator not to be treatment-related. One additional death was reported for a subject who was not evaluated for efficacy. This death was assessed by the investigator to likely be treatment-related, though assessed by the trial sponsor to likely be the result of advanced disease and/or pneumonia. The following chart depicts the TRAEs observed in our Phase 2 ACCURACY trial, as of the data cutoff date of June 30, 2020.

 Regulatory Approval Strategy 
 In May 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to AL101 for the treatment of ACC. In addition, in February 2020, the FDA granted fast track designation to AL101 for the treatment of R/M ACC. Given the significant unmet medical need and lack of FDA-approved therapies for patients with R/M ACC, we may seek a potential expedited regulatory review pathway pending additional results from the ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY trial. 
 AL101 for the Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
 Disease Background 
 TNBC is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. Breast cancer, which has an annual incidence of approximately 270,000 patients in the United States, is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 10% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with TNBC, which is associated with a younger age at diagnosis, advanced stage at diagnosis, increased risk of visceral metastasis and decreased survival. TNBC is characterized by the lack of: estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and excess HER2 protein. Approximately 37% of TNBC patients have R/M TNBC, resulting in an annual incidence of approximately 10,000 R/M TNBC patients in the United States. Based on primary literature and our bioinformatics research, we estimate that approximately 9% to 16% of R/M TNBC patients have Notch-activating gene alterations including mutations and other fusions. 
Current Treatment Landscape 
 There are limited treatment options available for patients with R/M TNBC. These therapies are limited to TNBC patients that are germline breast cancer gene positive or with tumors that express high PD-L1 levels. When these patients relapse, they are treated with chemotherapy. All other TNBC patients are initially treated with chemotherapy. However, responses to chemotherapy are not durable and relapse is often rapid. Approximately 80% of first-line TNBC patients require second-line therapies and approximately 60% of these patients 
 
16 


  will progress to third-line therapies. Second-line therapies for patients with metastatic TNBC are suboptimal, with median overall survival of 10.2 months following second-line treatment regimens containing taxane, capecitabine or gemcitabine, and median overall survival of 15.2 months following second-line or later treatment with eribulin. Recently an ADC targeting trop-2 was approved for third-line patients with metastatic TNBC. Although the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with TNBC is 77%, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with metastatic TNBC is only 10%, indicating the need for new therapies that can prolong overall survival. Targeting the Notch pathway may provide an additional treatment option to these patients, as Notch-activating mutations are known to correlate with poorer prognosis. Accordingly, we believe that there remains a lack of effective treatment options for patients with R/M TNBC. 
 AL101 Potently Inhibited Notch-Activated TNBC Tumors in PDX Models 
 Following BMSs Phase 1 study in unselected subjects, we have expanded our TNBC research and generated data from nine TNBC PDX models. The results of these models provided evidence supporting our thesis that Notch-activating mutations in TNBC are responsive to GSIs. These PDX models were selected based on Notch genetic profiling to include Notch WT or different Notch-activating mutations. Two of these PDX models had Notch WT (CTG-0017 and CTG-1520) and three of these PDX models had Notch mutations that were not activating (CTG-1646, CTG-1167 and CTG-1941), all five of which were therefore not expected to respond to GSIs. In addition, four of these PDX models had Notch-activating mutations (CTG-1340) and/or fusions (CTG-1408, CTG-1374 and CTG-2010). Tumor tissue derived from individual patient biopsies were implanted into and grown in mice, which were then randomized to control vehicle or AL101 treatment arms and treated for a maximum of 60 days. 
 In these PDX models, we observed that AL101 as a monotherapy showed substantial anti-tumor activity that correlated with the presence of Notch-activating mutations. In PDX models with Notch-activating mutations, tumor regression was observed and TGI ranged from 62% to 147%. In PDX models with Notch WT or non-activating mutations, tumor growth inhibition ranged from 12% to 64%. The following graphs depict the results of administration of AL101 on TGI compared to control vehicle, in each of the nine TNBC PDX models. 
 Anti-Tumor Activity of AL101 as a Monotherapy in TNBC PDX Tumors 
 

Mice (n=5) bearing TNBC PDX tumors were treated with vehicle or AL101 (3 mg/kg for four consecutive days a week). The four models on the left bear Notch-activating mutations or fusions and the five models on the right either had Notch WT or non-activating mutations, which were not expected to respond to GSIs. Dotted lines represent an average of n=4 mice. 
 We believe that the results from these models support the clinical development of AL101 as a potential targeted monotherapy for patients with R/M TNBC with Notch-activating mutations. 
 Our Proposed Solution for R/M TNBC: AL101 
 We are developing AL101 as a monotherapy for the treatment of R/M TNBC to address the lack of effective treatment options for these patients. In the Phase 1 study of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy in unselected, heavily pretreated subjects, which included 22 TNBC subjects, a CR was observed in one TNBC subject, PRs were observed in seven TNBC subjects and SD was observed in five TNBC subjects. Our IND for AL101 for the treatment of TNBC was accepted by the FDA in April 2020. Based on these findings and supporting data from our own PDX models, we commenced a Phase 2 TENACITY clinical trial of AL101 as a monotherapy for the treatment of R/M TNBC in patients with Notch-activating mutations. 
 
17 


 Our Ongoing Phase 2 TENACITY trial: 
 The Phase 2 TENACITY study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL101 monotherapy in patients with Notch-activated R/M TNBC. It is an open-label, multicenter, single arm study which is expected to initially enroll up to 26 patients with Notch-activated R/M TNBC whose disease has recurred or progressed after three or fewer lines of prior therapy. Notch activation will be determined using an NGS based assay screen. The design of the Phase 2 TENACITY clinical trial is below. 
 



* | Includes six subjects in lead-in.
--+----------------------------------

 The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Secondary endpoints include safety, duration of response, progression free survival and relapse free survival. Subjects enrolled in the trial will be dosed with AL101 IV once weekly, and dosing will continue until lack of clinical benefit is observed or consent is withdrawn. 
 We dosed the first patient enrolled in the study in January 2021 and expect to report preliminary data by the end of 2021. 
 AL101 for the Treatment of T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
 Disease Background 
 T-ALL is an aggressive, rare form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a disease which has an annual incidence of approximately 6,000 patients in the United States. T-ALL has an annual incidence of approximately 1,200 patients in the United States, of which an estimated 400, including pediatric patients, present for the treatment of R/R T-ALL. Notch is known to be a critical component of T-cell development and is inherently implicated as a tumorigenic driver in T-ALL. Approximately 65% of all T-ALL patients have Notch-activating mutations. In addition, there is an incremental subset of patients with Notch pathway activation who do not bear Notch-activating mutations. 
 T-ALL often presents as a result of the bone marrow being unable to produce sufficient amounts of normal blood cells, leading to symptoms such as anemia, infection, bleeding, bruising, fever, weakness and fatigue. Patients suffering from T-ALL frequently have central nervous system complications, as well as swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum, or middle of the chest, which often affects breathing and circulation. 
 Current Treatment Landscape 
 The curative therapy for T-ALL is an allogeneic transplant. However, in order to be eligible to receive a transplant, patients must have exhibited a CR to prior therapies. The current standard first-line therapy for T-ALL is an intensive chemotherapy regimen, which yields overall survival rates greater than 80% among pediatric patients and approximately 50% among adult patients. Although first-line therapy is effective in most T-ALL patients, an estimated 55% of adult patients and 20% of pediatric patients will relapse. Second-line therapies for R/R T-ALL include targeted therapies administered in combination with chemotherapy and have shown limited efficacy, with an overall survival rate lower than 20% for pediatric patients. As a result, we believe that there remains a lack of effective treatment options for patients with R/R T-ALL.
Our Proposed Solution for R/R T-ALL: AL101 
 We are developing AL101 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL to address the lack of effective treatment options for these patients. In the Phase 1 study of AL101, which included 26 unselected, heavily pretreated T-ALL evaluable subjects treated at 4 mg or 6 mg dose levels, CRs were observed in two subjects and a PR was observed in one subject. Of the three subjects who displayed a response, two had a confirmed Notch-activating mutation. Based on these findings and preclinical studies, we intend to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial of AL101 for the treatment of R/R T-ALL in 2022, subject to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. 
 Phase 1 Studies 
 BMS evaluated AL101 in more than 200 unselected subjects with various cancers across three Phase 1 studies. While these Phase 1 studies did not report statistically significant overall results, clinical activity was observed in cancers in which activation of the Notch pathway is a known tumorigenic driver. In these Phase 1 studies, the recommended clinical dose for our ongoing Phase 2 ACCURACY and TENACITY trials was established. A summary of the three Phase 1 studies is below. 
 
18 


 CA216001 
 In a Phase 1 study of AL101 in heavily pretreated subjects with advanced or metastatic tumors, which we refer to as the CA216001 study, AL101 IV was administered as a monotherapy. A total of 58 subjects were evaluated in the dose-escalation phase and an additional 36 subjects were evaluated in the dose-expansion phase. Of these subjects, 43 were treated with 4 mg of AL101 IV once weekly and 14 subjects were treated with 6 mg of AL101 IV once weekly. An additional 11 subjects were treated in a twice-weekly dosing arm and received either 4 mg or 6 mg of AL101 IV twice weekly. The primary objective of the CA216001 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL101. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK, pharmacodynamics, or PD, changes in the expression of Notch-induced genes and the anti-tumor activity of AL101. Formal statistical testing for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics. The design of this study, including dose groupings, is depicted below. 
 

Of the 94 subjects evaluated in this study, two subjects had ACC and three subjects had desmoid tumors. PRs were observed in three subjects, including one subject with ACC and two subjects with desmoid tumors. In addition, SD was observed in 10 subjects, including one subject with ACC and one subject with desmoid tumors. As shown in the below graphs, the PK of AL101 was linear, with dose-dependent increases in exposure that correlated with suppression of the PD marker Hes1. 
 

Subjects enrolled in the CA216001 study were heavily pretreated, with over 70% of subjects previously undergoing at least three lines of prior therapy. AL101 was generally observed to be well tolerated at both of the doses chosen for our Phase 2 ACCURACY and TENACITY trials. During the course of the study, there were 27 deaths, including one death due to hepatic failure in the highest weekly dose tested (8.4 mg) that was assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related. Treatment was discontinued in nine subjects due to TRAEs. Approximately 89% of subjects experienced at least one TRAE and approximately 51% of subjects experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs. In addition, approximately 16% of subjects dosed with 4 mg and approximately 29% of subjects dosed with 6 mg experienced TRSAEs. The following table represents the most commonly reported TRAEs. 
 
19 


 
QW = once weekly 
 The results from this Phase 1 study of AL101 supported advancing the once weekly dosing regimen of 4 mg or 6 mg and showed early signs of clinical activity across solid tumor types. In addition, AL101 was generally observed to be well tolerated at both of the doses chosen for our Phase 2 ACCURACY and TENACITY trials. 
 CA216002 
 In a Phase 1 study of AL101 in 31 heavily pretreated subjects, which included four T-LL subjects and 27 T-ALL subjects, AL101 IV was administered QW, or once weekly, as a monotherapy. We refer to this study as the CA216002 study. A total of 17 subjects were evaluated in the dose-escalation phase and an additional 14 subjects were evaluated in the dose-expansion phase. The primary objective of the CA216002 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL101. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK, PD changes in the expression of Notch-induced genes and the anti-tumor activity of AL101. Formal statistical testing for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics. The design of this study, including dose groupings, is depicted below. 
 

Dose-escalation Phase (3+3 design) (n=17) | Dose-expansion Phase (n=14)

 A total of 26 T-ALL subjects in this study received either a 4 mg or 6 mg dosage of AL101, 11 of whom had Notch 1 mutations. Objective responses were observed in three subjects with T-ALL, each in the 6 mg dose group, with CRs observed in two subjects and a PR observed in one subject. Of these three subjects, two had Notch 1 mutations. Following the administration of AL101, eight subjects with T-ALL experienced a 50% or greater reduction in leukemic blasts in bone marrow. 
 Subjects enrolled in the CA216002 study were heavily pretreated, with over 50% of subjects previously undergoing at least three lines of prior therapy. AL101 was generally well tolerated during the study. During the course of the study, there were 20 deaths, including one patient in the 4 mg once weekly dosing group who was heavily pretreated with at least four prior systemic therapies and died due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. While this patients death was assessed by the investigator not to be treatment-related, BMS determined that it was possible the death was treatment-related. Treatment was discontinued in one subject due to TRAEs. Approximately 74% of subjects experienced at least one TRAE and approximately 23% of subjects experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs. In addition, approximately 16% of subjects experienced TRSAEs, which included single events of hepatoxicity and hypersensitivity in the 4 mg dose cohort and single events of anemia, diarrhea and infusion-related reaction in the 6 mg dose cohort. The following table represents the most commonly reported TRAEs. 
 
20 


 
The results from this Phase 1 study of AL101 supported advancing the anticipated once weekly dosing regimen of 6 mg, as this dose showed signs of clinical activity and was generally observed to be well tolerated. 
 CA216003 
 In a Phase 1 study in heavily pretreated subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, which we refer to as the CA216003 study, AL101 IV was administered in combination with three different chemotherapy regimens. A total of 95 subjects were evaluated in the study, with 90 subjects receiving both chemotherapy and AL101. The primary objective of the CA216003 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy, PD changes in the expression of Notch-induced genes after treatment with AL101 in combination with chemotherapy and the anti-tumor activity of AL101 in combination with chemotherapy. Formal statistical testing for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics. 
 Of the 95 subjects evaluated in this study, 22 subjects had TNBC. Of the TNBC subjects, a CR was observed in one subject, PRs were observed in seven subjects and SD was observed in five subjects. 
 Subjects enrolled in the CA216003 study were heavily pretreated, with 40% of subjects previously undergoing at least three lines of prior therapy. AL101 in combination with chemotherapy was generally observed to be well tolerated during the study. During the course of the study, there were 32 deaths, but none were assessed by the investigator or BMS to be treatment-related. Treatment was discontinued in 15 subjects due to TRAEs. Nearly all subjects experienced at least one TRAE and approximately 82% of subjects experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 TRAE. In addition, approximately 34% of subjects experienced TRSAEs. The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TRSAEs included febrile neutropenia (10%) and diarrhea (6%). The most commonly reported TRAEs included: fatigue (78%), diarrhea (63%), hypophosphatemia (62%), nausea (52%), decreased appetite (46%), vomiting (39%), alopecia (38%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (26%), rash (26%), dysgeusia, or distortion of the sense of taste, (20%), dehydration (19%), weight decrease (18%), thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet count, (17%), hypokalemia, or low potassium levels, (17%), stomatitis, or inflammation of the mouth and lips, (16%) and myalgia, or muscle soreness (16%). 
 Our Novel Approach: AL102 
 Overview 
 AL102 is being developed as a potent, selective and oral GSI. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize AL102 from BMS in November 2017. We are initially developing AL102 for the treatment of desmoid tumors. In addition, we are collaborating with Novartis to develop AL102 for the treatment of MM in combination with Novartis BCMA-targeting agents. Recently the FDA has agreed, based on data from AL101 and AL102 studies including durable responses observed in patients with Desmoid tumors, with Ayalas plans to proceed with a Phase 2/3 pivotal study which can potentially be used as a registrational study. We intend to initiate a Phase 2/3 RINGSIDE pivotal study of AL102, in the first half of 2021 with an initial interim data read-out from part A and dose selection expected by mid-2022, with part B of the study to commence immediately thereafter. 
 AL102 for the Treatment of Desmoid Tumors 
 Disease Background 
 Desmoid tumors, also called aggressive fibromatosis, are rare connective tissue neoplasms with an annual incidence of approximately 1,700 patients in the United States, and arise in the extremities, abdominal wall, mesenteric root, and chest wall. An estimated 7% to 15% of desmoid tumors present in the head and neck. They do not metastasize, but often aggressively infiltrate neurovascular structures and vital organs resulting in pain, loss of function, organ dysfunction, and death. 
 Desmoid tumors are typically diagnosed in patients between 15 and 60 years of age, more often in young adults, with a two- to three-fold female predominance and no significant racial or ethnic predilection. 
 
21 


 Current Treatment Landscape 
 Although surgery and radiation remain the primary therapies for desmoid tumors, there are no treatment options for some patients given the diffuse nature of the tumor in some tissues. Surgery and radiation suffer from additional shortcomings including the morbidity associated with resection, disfigurement and/or functional impairment, post-operative complications and frequent recurrences. Aggressive adjuvant radiation therapy and surgical resection with wide margins of normal tissue may improve rates of post-surgical recurrence, which can occur in up to 72% of patients. 
 There are no FDA-approved systemic therapies for the treatment of unresectable, recurrent or progressive desmoid tumors and there is no currently accepted standard of care. Since current treatment responses are insufficient and not durable, there is an unmet medical need for the treatment of recurrent or progressive tumors (systemic therapy). Given the high recurrence and progression rates and lack of effective treatment options, we believe that there is a sizeable patient population with desmoid tumors with a high unmet medical need. 
 Clinical Evidence of GSI Activity in Desmoid Tumors 
 Based on data from multiple clinical evaluations, including data from three patients with desmoid tumors evaluated in a Phase 1 study of AL101 conducted by BMS, we believe that GSIs have the potential to address the shortcomings associated with existing treatment options for patients with desmoid tumors. In the Phase 1 study of AL101, PRs were observed in two subjects with desmoid tumors and SD was observed in another subject with desmoid tumors. In addition, three subjects, including two subjects from the Phase 1 study of AL101, entered into an expanded access program. 
 Below are scans from a patient who achieved a partial response and following the end of BMS study opted to continue into an expanded access program 
 

Phase 1 Study of AL102 
 Prior to our in-licensing of AL102, BMS conducted preclinical toxicity, PK and PD studies. AL102 was administered orally as a monotherapy in a Phase 1 study in 36 heavily pretreated cancer subjects. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and proper dosage of AL102. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK, PD changes in the expression of Notch-induced genes and the anti-tumor activity of

 AL102. Formal statistical testing for these endpoints was not performed and the results were presented as descriptive statistics. The study had two arms. Arm A was designed to study daily dosing while Arm B was designed to study dosing two consecutive days each week. The design of this study, including dose groupings, is depicted below: 
 Dose escalation phase (n=36) 
 

Of the 36 subjects evaluated in the study, SD was observed in 11 subjects, five of whom received AL102 for five months or longer and included subjects with ACC, fibromatosis (which is closely related to desmoid tumors), renal cell cancer and retroperitoneal fibroscarcoma. 
 The maximum tolerated dose for a once daily dosing regimen of Arm A was 1.5 mg, with one dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 nausea in the six dose-limited toxicity evaluable subjects. On the once daily schedule, the 2 mg dose was not tolerated, with dose-limiting toxicities in three of the five dose-limiting toxicity evaluable subjects, which included Grade 3 events of ileus, nausea, or pruritus/urticaria. A maximum tolerated dose was not established for a twice weekly dosing regimen of AL102, as Arm B was ongoing at the time that this study was terminated. The highest tolerated dose was 4 mg twice weekly, with no dose-limiting toxicities in the two dose-limiting toxicity evaluable subjects. A higher dose of 8 mg was not tolerated, with dose-limiting toxicities in two of the six dose-limiting toxicity evaluable subjects, which included Grade 3 diarrhea or Grade 3 nausea/dehydration/anorexia with Grade 2 fatigue. The most common TRAEs in this study included diarrhea (72%), hypophosphatemia (61%), nausea (61%), vomiting (44%), fatigue (44%), decreased appetite (36%), rash (31%), hypokalemia (28%) and pruritus (25%). In addition, TRSAEs experienced by more than one subject included diarrhea (8%) and nausea (8%). 
 BMS elected to terminate this study prior to completion due to strategic considerations. 
 Planned Phase 2/3 Pivotal Study of AL102 
 We intend to initiate the Phase 2/3 RINGSIDE pivotal study, which could potentially be used as a registrational trial, in adult and adolescent patients with desmoid tumors in the first half of 2021. The studys primary endpoint will be progression free survival with secondary endpoints including, objective response rate, duration of response and patient reported Quality of Life measures. Part A of the study will be open label and will enroll up to 36 patients with progressive desmoid tumors in three study arms across three doses of AL102: 1.2 mg daily, 2 mg twice weekly, and 4 mg twice weekly with initial follow up of safety, tolerability and tumor volume by MRI after 16 weeks in order to determine the optimal dose. At the end of part A, all patients will be eligible to enroll into an open label extension study at the selected dose where long-term efficacy and safety will be monitored. Part B of the study will start immediately after dose selection from part A and will be a double-blind placebo-controlled study enrolling up to 156 patients with progressive disease, randomized 2:1 between AL102 or placebo. We expect to commence the study in the first half of 2021 with an initial interim data read-out from part 1 and dose selection expected by mid-2022, with part B of the study to commence immediately thereafter.

 The design of the pivotal phase 2/3 RINGSIDE study is below: 
 

AL102 for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma 
 Despite numerous advances in the treatment landscape for MM, the disease remains incurable. BCMA is ubiquitously expressed on myeloma cells and is currently a target of active studies utilizing a number of therapeutic approaches. Increasing the expression of the BCMA on target cells and reducing the shedding in the circulation is believed to potentially enhance therapies and increase responses. 
 We are collaborating with Novartis to develop AL102 for the treatment of MM in combination with Novartis BCMA-targeting therapies. In December 2018, we granted Novartis the exclusive ability to evaluate, develop and potentially license and commercialize AL102, as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, for the treatment of MM. Novartis conducted a preclinical study evaluating AL102 alone and in combination with an investigational anti-BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, or BisAb, controlled by Novartis. Using a preclinical cell line model of human multiple myeloma (KMS11) and shown in the figure below, Novartis study showed that treatment with AL102 resulted in an approximate 20-fold increase in the levels of cell surface expression of BCMA and decreased shedding of BCMA to below lower levels of detection, as measured by levels of soluble BCMA. 
 AL102 Reduced Shed BCMA and Increased Membrane BCMA Levels in MM Cell Lines 
 

Soluble BCMA levels (ng/mL) from culture supernatants of KMS11 cells treated overnight with a serial dilution of AL102 are shown on the left Y axis. Antibody binding capacity, or ABC, of anti-BCMA on the surface of AL102 treated KMS11 cells is shown on the right Y axis. AL102 inhibited shedding of BCMA from KMS11 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which resulted in increased BCMA expression on the cell surface over the same dose range. Untreated KMS11 cells have a BCMA ABC of approximately 14,000. The average ABC with treatment of 10 nM AL102 was approximately 285,000, representing an approximate 20-fold increase in cell surface BCMA expression with AL102 treatment. 
 
24 


 In addition, we tested increasing concentrations of three different GSI molecules, AL102, Nirogacestat and Crenigacestat on shed BCMA and membrane BCMA in UM266 multiple myeloma cell lines. As seen in the figures below, similar dose related activity as measured by mean flurescence intensity, or MFI, for membrane BCMA and by change from baseline for shed BCMA was observed for AL102 and Crenigacestat while relatively weaker activity was observed for Nirogacestat. 
 

As shown below, in an assay designed by Novartis to evaluate the BisAb redirected t-cell cytotoxicity, or RTCC, activity in vitro, using human MM cells from donors, AL102 enhanced BisAb RTCC activity in a dose-dependent manner with enhancement of BisAb potency at concentrations of approximately 8nM or higher. 
 

Novartis has initiated a Phase 1 study with its bi-specific anti-BCMA agent, but dosing of AL102 has not yet been initiated. Novartis will be responsible for the conduct and expenses of any trials of AL102 in combination with their BCMA-targeting agents. We believe that the clinical activity of BCMA-targeting agents may also be enhanced in clinical trials when used in combination with a GSI such as AL102. 
 License Agreements 
 Bristol-Myers Squibb Company License Agreement 
 In November 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the BMS License Agreement, with BMS, under which BMS granted us a worldwide, non-transferable, exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by BMS to research, discover, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, export, import and commercialize AL101 and AL102, or the BMS Licensed Compounds, and products containing AL101 or AL102, or the BMS Licensed Products, for all uses including the prevention, treatment or control of any human or animal disease, disorder or condition. 
 Under the BMS License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts, either through ourselves or through our affiliates or sublicensees, to develop at least one BMS Licensed Product. As between BMS and us, we have sole responsibility for, and bear the cost of, conducting research and development and preparing all regulatory filings and related submissions with respect to the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. BMS has assigned and transferred all INDs for the BMS Licensed Compounds to us. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approvals in certain major market countries for at least one BMS Licensed Product, as well as to commercialize and sell each BMS Licensed Product after obtaining such regulatory approval. As between BMS and us, we have sole responsibility for, and bear the cost of, commercializing BMS Licensed Products. For a limited period of time, we may not, either by ourselves or through our affiliates, sublicensees, or any other third parties, engage directly or indirectly in the clinical development or commercialization of a Notch inhibitor molecule that is not a BMS Licensed Compound. 
 
25 


 As consideration of the rights granted by BMS to us under the BMS License Agreement, we paid BMS a payment of $6 million and issued to BMS 1,125,929 shares of Series A preferred stock valued at approximately $7.3 million. We are required to pay BMS payments upon the achievement of certain development or regulatory milestone events of up to $95 million in the aggregate with respect to the first BMS Licensed Compound to achieve each such event and up to $47 million in the aggregate with respect to each additional BMS Licensed Compound to achieve each such event. We are also obligated to pay BMS payments of up to $50 million in the aggregate for each BMS Licensed Product that achieves certain sales-based milestone events and tiered royalties on net sales of each BMS Licensed Product by us or our affiliates or sublicensees at rates ranging from a high single-digit to low teen percentage, depending on the total annual worldwide net sales of each such Licensed Product. If we sublicense or assign any rights to the licensed patents, the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or the BMS Licensed Products, we are required to share with BMS a portion of all consideration we receive from such sublicense or assignment, ranging from a mid-teen to mid-double-digit percentage, depending on the development stage of the most advanced BMS Licensed Compound or BMS Licensed Product that is subject to the applicable sublicense or assignment, but such portion may be reduced based on the milestone or royalty payments that are payable by us to BMS under the BMS License Agreement. 
 The BMS License Agreement remains in effect, on a country-by-country and BMS Licensed Product-by-BMS Licensed Product basis, until the expiration of royalty obligations with respect to a given BMS Licensed Product in the applicable country. Royalties are paid on a country-by-country and BMS Licensed Product-by-BMS Licensed Product basis from the first commercial sale of a particular BMS Licensed Product in a country until the latest of (a) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such BMS Licensed Product in such country, (b) when such BMS Licensed Product is no longer covered by a valid claim in the licensed patent rights in such country, or (c) the expiration of any regulatory or marketing exclusivity for such BMS Licensed Product in such country. 
 Any inventions, and related patent rights, invented solely by either party pursuant to activities conducted under the BMS License Agreement shall be solely owned by such party, and any inventions, and related patent rights, conceived of jointly by us and BMS pursuant to activities conducted under the BMS License Agreement shall be jointly owned by us and BMS, with BMSs rights thereto included in our exclusive license. We have the first rightwith reasonable consultation with, or participation by, BMSto prepare, prosecute, maintain and enforce the licensed patents, at our expense. 
 BMS has the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement in its entirety upon written notice to us (a) for insolvency-related events involving us, (b) for our material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, (c) for our failure to fulfill our obligations to develop or commercialize the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products not remedied within a defined period of time following written notice by BMS, or (d) if we or our affiliates commence any action challenging the validity, scope, enforceability or patentability of any of the licensed patent rights. We have the right to terminate the BMS License Agreement (a) for convenience upon prior written notice to BMS, the length of notice dependent on whether a BMS Licensed Product has received regulatory approval, (b) upon immediate written notice to BMS for insolvency-related events involving BMS, (c) for BMSs material breach of the BMS License Agreement if such breach remains uncured for a defined period of time, or (d) on a BMS Licensed Compound-by-BMS Licensed Compound and/or BMS Licensed Product-by-BMS Licensed Product basis upon immediate written notice to BMS if we reasonably determine that there are unexpected safety and public health issues relating to the applicable BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. Upon termination of the BMS License Agreement in its entirety by us for convenience or by BMS, we grant an exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to BMS under certain of our patent rights that are necessary to develop, manufacture or commercialize BMS Licensed Compounds or BMS Licensed Products. In exchange for such license, BMS must pay us a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of the BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products by it or its affiliates, licensees or sublicensees, provided that the termination occurred after a specified developmental milestone for such BMS Licensed Compounds and/or BMS Licensed Products. 
 Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited Evaluation, Option and License Agreement 
 In December 2018, we entered into an evaluation, option and license agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Limited, or Novartis, pursuant to which Novartis agreed to conduct certain studies to evaluate AL102 in combination with its B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, therapies in multiple myeloma, and we agreed to supply AL102 for such studies. All supply and development costs associated with such evaluation studies are fully borne by Novartis. 
 Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive (including as to us and our affiliates), sublicensable (subject to certain terms and conditions), worldwide license and sublicense (as applicable) under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by us (including applicable patent rights and know-how that are licensed from BMS pursuant to the BMS License Agreement) to research, develop, manufacture (subject to our non-exclusive right to manufacture and supply AL102 and/or the Novartis Licensed Product for Novartis) and commercialize AL102 and/or any pharmaceutical product containing AL102 as the sole active ingredient, or the Novartis Licensed Product, for the diagnosis, prophylaxis, treatment, or prevention of multiple myeloma in humans. We also granted Novartis the right of first negotiation for the license rights to conduct development or commercialization activities with respect to the use of AL102 for indications other than multiple myeloma. Additionally, from the exercise by Novartis of its option until the termination of the Novartis Agreement, we may not, either ourselves or through our affiliates or any other third parties, directly or indirectly research, develop or commercialize certain BCMA-related compounds for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 
 Novartis must pay us a low eight figure option exercise fee in order to exercise its option and activate its license, upon which we will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $245 million in the aggregate and tiered royalties on net sales of Novartis Licensed Products by Novartis or its affiliates or sublicensees at rates ranging from a mid-single-digit to low double-digit percentage, depending on the total annual worldwide net sales of Novartis Licensed Products. Royalties will be paid on a country-by-
 
26 


  country and Novartis Licensed Product-by-Novartis Licensed Product basis from the first commercial sale of a particular Novartis Licensed Product in a country until the latest of (a) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such Novartis Licensed Product in such country, (b) when such Novartis Licensed Product is no longer covered by a valid claim in the licensed patent rights in such country, or (c) the expiration of any regulatory or marketing exclusivity for such Novartis Licensed Product in such country. Contemporaneously with the Novartis Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement and associated investment agreements, or the SPA, with Novartiss affiliate, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or NIBRI, pursuant to which NIBRI acquired a $10 million equity stake in us. 
 Novartis shall own any inventions, and related patent rights, invented solely by it or jointly with us in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the Novartis Agreement. We will maintain first right to prosecute and maintain any patents licensed to Novartis, both before and after its exercise of its option. We maintain the first right to defend and enforce our patents prior to Novartiss exercise of its option, upon which Novartis gains such right with respect to patents included in the license. 
 The option we granted to Novartis will remain in effect until the earlier of (a) 60 days following the last visit of the last subject in the evaluation studies, (b) the termination of the Novartis Agreement, or (c) 36 months following the delivery by us to Novartis of sufficient amounts of clinical evaluation materials to conduct the anticipated clinical studies. The Novartis Agreement remains in effect until such time as no Novartis Licensed Product is being developed or commercialized by Novartis, its affiliates, or sublicensees (including distributors or commercial partners), unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) for Novartiss material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which Novartis is making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (b) for Novartiss failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize AL102 and/or the Novartis Licensed Product not remedied within four months following written notice to Novartis. Novartis has the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement (a) in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis for convenience, upon 60 days written notice to us, (b) for our material breach if such breach remains uncured for 60 days (such cure period shall be extended for an additional period during which we are making good faith efforts to cure such breach) or (c) upon immediate written notice to us for insolvency-related events involving us. 
 Manufacturing 
 We rely on third parties to manufacture AL101 and AL102. We have entered into agreements with leading CMOs to produce both AL101 and AL102 for our ongoing and planned clinical studies and clinical trials for AL101 and AL102. We are also currently in the process of manufacturing batches to support all of our expected clinical supply needs as well as batches to support a potential NDA submission. We require all of our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We currently rely solely on these CMOs for scale-up and process development work and to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials. We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time to cover commercial production. We may also elect to enter into agreements with other CMOs to manufacture supplies of drug substance and finished drug product. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to market and commercialize our product candidates, if approved, by building our own specialized sales and marketing organization initially in the United States. We believe our target market can be addressed by a small number of dedicated marketing and medical sales specialists covering specialized oncologists treating the target patient population. We may also selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates, if approved. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid evolution of technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with approved treatment options, if any, including off-label therapies, and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key considerations that would impact our ability to effectively compete with other therapies include the efficacy, safety, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection of our products. Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. 
 We consider our most direct competitors with respect to AL101 and AL102 to be companies developing GSIs, including SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc. and Celgene Corporation, recently acquired by BMS, or companies that are developing Notch inhibitors, including, but not limited to, Cellestia Biotech AG and Ciclomed LLC. 
 In addition, with respect to AL101 for the treatment of ACC, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including, but not limited to, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Cellestia Biotech AG and Elevar Therapeutics, Inc., which we believe all are at an early development stage. 
 With respect to AL101 for the treatment of TNBC, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including, but not limited to, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Merck & Co., Inc., BMS, AstraZeneca Plc, Gilead (acquired Immunomedics Inc.) and Pfizer Inc. 
 
27 


 With respect to AL101 for the treatment of T-ALL, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing products for this indication, including, but not limited to, Sanofi S.A., Janssen Pharmaceutica, Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc and Vasgene Therapeutics, Inc. 
 With respect to AL102, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing product candidates for the treatment of desmoid tumors, including, but not limited to, SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., Bayer Corporation, Cellestia Biotech AG and Iterion Therapeutics, Inc. 
 With respect to MM, we are aware that other companies are, or may be, developing product candidates with GSI as anti-BCMA agents, including, but not limited to, Springworks Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline plc, Janssen, Allogene, Pfizer, Precision Biosciences and Celgene Corporation, recently acquired by BMS. 
 Smaller or early-stage companies, including oncology-focused therapeutics companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling patients in clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The availability of reimbursement from government and private payors will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approvals for our product candidates, if any, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to commercialize our product candidates. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and to defend and enforce, and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We take efforts to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuit of U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, such as compositions of matter and methods of use, that we determine are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also may rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For more information regarding risks relating to intellectual property, please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
Patents and Patent Applications 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file patent applications, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application, assuming the patent has not been terminally disclaimed over a commonly-owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor, or over a patent not commonly owned but that was disqualified as prior art as the result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. In the United States, the term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term adjustment for delays within the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, may permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of such patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek any available patent term extension to any issued patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned or exclusively licensed a total of five issued U.S. patents, 121 granted foreign patents, twelve pending U.S. patent applications, 43 pending foreign patent applications, and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications. 
 In November 2017, we entered into the BMS License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights under certain patents and know-how controlled by BMS to research, discover, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, export, import and commercialize AL101 and AL102. For more information regarding the BMS License Agreement, please see License Agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the patent rights exclusively in-licensed under the BMS License Agreement include the following patent families: 
 

 | A patent family having claims directed to the composition of matter of AL101 and methods of treating certain types of cancer, which includes two issued U.S. patents, 62 granted patents in 62 foreign jurisdictions (including China, the European Patent Office, or EPO, Japan and the Russian Federation) and six pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. Without taking potential patent term extension or adjustment into account, the issued patents and any patents issued from pending applications in this family are expected to expire in 2032.

 | A patent family having claims directed to the composition of matter of AL102 and methods of treating certain types of cancer, which includes two issued U.S. patents, 59 granted patents in 59 foreign jurisdictions (including China, the EPO, Japan and the Russian Federation), and eight pending patent applications in eight foreign jurisdictions. Without taking potential patent term extension or adjustment into account, the issued patents and any patents issued from pending applications in this family are expected to expire in 2033.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A patent family consisting of one issued U.S. patent having claims directed to the method of use for the combination of AL101 with gemcitabine for treating cancer that is expected to expire, without taking potential patent term extension or adjustment into account, in 2034.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2020, we solely owned 10 U.S. pending patent applications, one PCT application, and 33 foreign pending applications. In addition, we co-owned one U.S. pending application and 10 foreign pending applications with BMS, covering the use of AL101 for treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and for the use of AL102 for treating Desmoid tumors. 
 One of our solely-owned patent families, consisting of one pending U.S. patent application and 10 foreign pending applications, includes claims directed to methods of using AL101 to treat Notch-altered ACC. 
 Another solely-owned patent family, consisting of one PCT application, includes claims directed to methods of using AL101 to treat Notch-altered TNBC. 
 A third solely-owned patent family, consisting of one U.S. pending application and 10 foreign pending applications, includes claims directed to AL102 and BCMA-related combination treatments and methods of use for treating multiple myeloma. Any patents issued from our owned patent applications or from patent applications claiming the priority of such patent applications are expected to expire, without taking potential patent term extension or adjustment into account, between 2039 and 2040. 
 Trade Secrets 
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, confidential information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of such items to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection. We maintain efforts to protect such proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, and non-solicitation and non-compete agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors, suppliers and other parties who may have access to our confidential or proprietary information. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of its relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the other party contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to us, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets or other proprietary information, including in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding risks relating to trade secrets, third parties and other factors that could affect our intellectual property rights, please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.

 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDAs good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice requirements, or GCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.

30 


 
 | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach consensus on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Process 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision after it the application is submitted. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 
31 


 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a fast track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 
32 


 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as breakthrough therapies that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. 
 In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Product candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA will generally require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon NDA sponsors and any third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
33 


 
 | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 We expect that certain of our product candidates may require an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our product candidates. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our product candidates will utilize the PMA pathway. 
 If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices. According to the guidance, for novel product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDAs Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 
34 


 The FDA has generally required companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations with respect to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, as well as similar foreign laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
 For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additional reporting and transparency requirements for payments to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse midwives go into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private

  insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligation, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than HIPAA and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/ or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA came into effect on January 1, 2020, and became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. 
 European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Union, or EU, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU and EEA member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting and pseudonymized (i.e. key-coded) data. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to such individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines of up to 20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties, for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EU. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. The aforementioned EU rules are applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in United Kingdom national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of 20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payors decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.

 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Supreme Court of the United States is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
