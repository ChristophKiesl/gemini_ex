Our Products
We aim to be the brand that customers request for the innovation and value we create. Our door solutions address the dynamic nature of compliance, technical specifications and developing market needs.
We sell an extensive range of interior and exterior doors in a wide array of designs, materials and sizes. Our interior doors are made with wood and related materials such as hardboard (including wood composite molded and flat door facings). Our exterior doors are made primarily of steel, fiberglass or composite materials. 
Our focus on consumer driven innovation led us to think broadly about the entire door system and the value it can bring when integrated. This approach combined with Masonite’s business relationships in the industry led to the development of award winning products such as the M-PwrTM Smart Doors and the Masonite Performance Door System. Masonite’s M-PwrTM Smart Doors are the first residential exterior doors to integrate power, lights, a video doorbell and smart lock into the door system. They employ patent-pending, Underwriters Laboratories ("UL") certified technology to connect residential front doors to a home’s electrical system and wireless internet network. The Masonite Performance Door System features the company’s industry-leading 4-Point Performance Seal, which includes Premium Square Edge Fiberglass Doors, Endura Products’ Z-Articulating Cap SillTM, PE650 Weatherstripping, Simple Solution® Corner Pads and FrameSaver® rot-proof door frame.
Residential Doors
Interior Doors
Molded panel doors are interior doors available either with a hollow or solid core and are made by assembling two molded door skin panels around a wood or medium-density fiberboard ("MDF") frame. Molded panel doors are routinely used for closets, bedrooms, bathrooms and hallways. Our molded panel product line is subdivided into several distinct product groups: our Classic Molded Panel series is a combination of classic styling, period and architectural style-specific designs, durable construction and a variety of profiles preferred by our customers when price sensitivity is a critical component in the product selection; the West EndTM Collection strengthens our tradition of design innovation by introducing the clean and simple aesthetics found in modern linear designs to the molded panel interior door category; the Heritage® Series, which features recessed, flat panels and sharp, Shaker-style profiles which speak to a clean, modern aesthetic while retaining comfortable familiarity found in today’s interiors; and the Livingston door, which features versatile and timeless design for any style of home. Our doors can be upgraded to our environmentally friendly EmeraldTM door construction which enables homeowners, builders and architects to meet specific product 
requirements and "green" specifications to attain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") certification.
Flush interior doors are available either with a hollow or solid core and are made by assembling two facings of plywood, MDF, composite wood or hardboard over a wood or MDF frame. These doors can either have a wood veneer surface suitable for paint or staining or a composite wood surface suitable for paint. Our flush doors range from base residential flush doors consisting of unfinished composite wood to the ultra high-end exotic wood veneer doors.
Exterior Doors
Fiberglass doors are considered premier exterior doors and are made by assembling two fiberglass door facings to a wood frame or composite material and injecting the core with polyurethane insulation. Fiberglass is strong, durable, lightweight and impervious to many caustics and to extreme temperatures. These attributes make fiberglass an ideal material for an exterior door that may face extremes in temperature, exposure to the elements and general wear and tear. In the United Kingdom, Door-StopTM branded fiberglass doors are manufactured into pre-hung door sets and shipped to our customers with industry-leading lead times. We believe our innovative designs, construction and finishes will help our fiberglass door collections retain a distinct role in the exterior product category in the future. Our Solidor® exterior doors are composite doors that provide the appearance of timber, but with the benefits of modern, low maintenance materials. A solid timber core is complemented by a variety of innovative design and color choices that has led Solidor® to become one of the United Kingdom's most recognized manufacturers and suppliers of composite doors. 
Steel doors are exterior doors made by assembling two interlocking steel facings (paneled or flat) or attaching two steel facings to a wood or steel frame and injecting the core with polyurethane insulation. With our functional Utility Steel series, the design centric High Definition family and the pre-finished Sta-Tru® HD, we offer customers the freedom to select the right combination of design, protection and compliance required for essentially any paint grade exterior door application. In addition, our product offering is significantly increased through our variety of compatible clear or decorative glass designs.
Stile and rail doors are made from wood or MDF with individual panels, which have been cut, milled, veneered and assembled from lumber such as clear pine, knotty pine, oak and cherry. Within our stile and rail line, glass panels can be inserted to create what is commonly referred to as a French door and we offer a number of glass designs for use in this purpose. Where horizontal slats are inserted between the stiles and rails, the resulting door is referred to as a louver door. For interior purposes, stile and rail doors are primarily used for hallways, room dividers, closets and bathrooms. For exterior purposes, stile and rail doors are used as entry doors often including decorative glass inserts.
Architectural Doors
Architectural doors are typically highly specified products designed, constructed and tested to ensure that regulatory compliance such as fire codes and environmental certifications such as Forest Stewardship Council are met. These doors are sold into institutional (schools, healthcare and government) and commercial (hotels, offices and retail) end markets. These end markets require doors that provide fire safety, security, acoustic comfort and sustainability. Our architectural portfolio is represented by two series, AspiroTM and CenduraTM which are comprised of stile and rail, flush wood veneer, painted and laminate doors. The AspiroTM series offers premium and custom aesthetic options along with high performance options in acoustic, fire-rated, lead-lined, attack- and bullet-resistance and sustainability. The CenduraTM series provides a balance of performance and value and is available with our standard aesthetic options with acoustic and fire-rated options. Our portfolio allows us to provide a wide range of solutions to cover the varied needs of commercial and institutional end markets.
Components
In addition to residential and architectural doors, we also sell several door components to the building materials industry. Within the residential new construction market, we provide interior door facings, agri-fiber and particleboard door cores, MDF and wood cut stock components to multiple manufacturers. Within the architectural building construction market, we are a leading component supplier of various critical door components. Additionally, we are one of the leading providers of mineral and particleboard door cores to the North American architectural door industry.
Molded door facings are thin sheets of molded hardboard produced by grinding or defibrating wood chips, adding resin and other ingredients, creating a thick mat of wood fibers, which is then pressed between steel die plates to 
form a molded sheet, the surface of which may be smooth or may contain a wood grain pattern. Following pressing, molded door facings are trimmed, primed and shipped to door manufacturing plants where they are mounted on frames to produce molded doors.
Door framing materials, commonly referred to as cut stock, are wood or MDF components that constitute the frame on which interior and exterior door facings are attached. Door cores are pressed fiber mats of refined wood chips or agri-fiber used in the construction of solid core doors. For doors that must achieve a fire rating higher than 45 minutes or longer, the door core typically consists of an inert mineral core or similar compounds.
Research and Development
We believe we are a global leader in end user focused innovation and development of doors, door components and full door solutions as well as the manufacturing processes involved in making such products. We believe that research and development is a competitive advantage for us, and we intend to capitalize on our leadership in this area through focus on end user problems that lead to the development of more new and innovative products. Our end user experience, research and development and engineering capabilities enable us to organically create and solicit external innovative ideas; methodically validate commercial and technical viability; use cross functional teams to develop business case hypotheses for promising concepts; and implement new to world products and manufacturing process improvements. The result of this rigorous approach enables us to launch new innovative, proprietary end user valued solutions, enhance the manufacturing efficiency of our products, improve quality and reduce costs. As part of Masonite’s Doors That Do MoreTM strategy, we have invested in innovation activities with a significant focus on the development of new, differentiated products such as our M-PwrTM Smart Doors, as well as focusing on process and material improvements to improve quality. In the Architectural wood door market, we have directed research and development to address the growing need for specified door systems in critical areas of safety and security, including our first attack resistant door system and expanded offerings of fire-resistant products.
As an integrated manufacturer focused on the door industry, we have technical depth and expertise from material science to components and full door system testing and development that parallels our vertical integration. These capabilities have been instrumental in our ability to thoroughly qualify alternative materials and components to address supply challenges over the past few years. We leverage our deep knowledge and experience in door construction and assembly as well as our ability to manufacture dies for use in our facilities. We believe this provides us with a unique ability to offer a combination of high value door solutions to meet the needs of a variety of end users and customers. This capability also enables us to develop and implement product and production process improvements which increase average unit price, enhance production efficiency and/or reduce costs. 
Raw Materials
While Masonite is vertically integrated, we require a regular supply of raw materials, such as wood chips, some cut stock components, various composites, steel, glass, paint, stain and primer as well as petroleum-based products such as binders, resins and plastic injection frames to manufacture and assemble our products. In 2022, our materials cost accounted for approximately 53% of the total cost of the finished product. In certain instances, we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for these supplies. Wood chips, logs, resins, binders and other additives utilized in the manufacturing of interior molded facings, exterior fiberglass door facings and door cores are purchased from global, regional and local suppliers taking into consideration the relative freight cost of these materials. Internal framing components, MDF, cut stock and internal door cores are manufactured internally at our facilities and supplemented from suppliers located throughout the world. We utilize a network of suppliers based in North America, Europe, South America and Asia to purchase other components including steel coils for the stamping of steel door facings, MDF, plywood and hardboard facings, door jambs and frames and glass frames and inserts.
Manufacturing Process
Our manufacturing process is designed to deliver reliable supply of high-quality products and outstanding service. Over the past several years, we have invested in advanced manufacturing technologies to increase quality and shorten lead times. Launched in 2015, we leverage the Mvantage operating system within our manufacturing processes to systemically focus on the elimination of waste and non-value-added activities throughout the organization. In 2022, we continued to progress our deployment of Mvantage throughout the entire enterprise to drive improvements in manufacturing efficiency. Our newest European plant, Stoke-on-Trent, has been optimized to improve material flow and to reduce the need for forklift trucks to enhance safety and reduce emissions and utilizes advanced manufacturing automation to improve production and efficiency, product quality and the work experience for our employees. Our 
newest North American interior door facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina, was designed to incorporate all of our best Mvantage practices as well as incorporate the latest manufacturing technology to optimize the door manufacturing process.
We are one of the few vertically integrated door manufacturers in the world and one of only two in the North American residential molded interior door industry as well as the only vertically integrated door manufacturer in the North American architectural interior wood door industry. Our vertical integration extends to all steps of the production process from initial design, development and production of steel press plates to produce interior molded and exterior fiberglass door facings to the manufacturing of door components, such as door cores, wood veneers and molded facings, to door assembly. We also offer incremental value by pre-machining doors for hardware, hanging doors in frames with glass and hardware and pre-finishing doors with paint or stain. We believe that our vertical integration and automation enhance our ability to develop new and proprietary products, provide greater value and improved customer service and create high barriers to entry. We also believe vertical integration enhances our ability to be more cost efficient, although our cost structure is subject to certain factors beyond our control, such as global commodity shocks.
Our manufacturing operations consist of three major manufacturing processes: (1) component manufacturing, (2) door assembly and (3) value-added ready to install door fabrication.
We have a leading position in the manufacturing of door components, including internal framing components (stile and rails), glass inserts (lites), door core, interior door facings (molded and veneer) and exterior door facings. The manufacturing of interior molded door facings is the most complex of these processes requiring a significant investment in large scale wood fiber processing equipment. Interior molded door facings are produced by combining fine wood particles, synthetic resins and other additives under heat and pressure in large multi-opening automated presses utilizing Masonite proprietary steel plates. The facings are then primed, cut and inspected in a second highly automated continuous operation prior to being packed for shipping to our door assembly plants. We operate five interior molded door facing plants around the world, two in North America and one in each of South America, Europe and Asia. Our plant in Laurel, Mississippi, is one of the largest door facing plants in the world and we believe one of the most technologically advanced in the industry.
Interior residential hollow and solid core door manufacturing is an assembly operation that is primarily accomplished through the use of semi-skilled manual labor. The construction process for a standard flush or molded interior door is based on assembly of door facings and various internal framing and support components, followed by the doors being trimmed to their final specifications.
The assembly process varies by type of door, from a relatively simple process for flush and molded doors, where the door facings are glued to a wood frame, to more complex processes where many pieces of solid and engineered wood are converted to louver or stile and rail doors. Architectural interior doors require another level of customization and sophistication employing the use of solid cores with varying degrees of sound dampening and fire retarding attributes, furniture quality wood veneer facings, as well as secondary machining operations to incorporate more sophisticated commercial hardware, openers and locks. Additionally, architectural doors are typically pre-finished prior to sale.
The manufacturing of steel and fiberglass exterior doors is a semi-automated process that entails combining laminated wood or rot free composite framing components between two door facings and then injecting the resulting hollow core structure with insulating polyurethane expanding foam core materials. We invested in fiberglass manufacturing technology, including the vertical integration of our own fiberglass sheet molding compound plant at our Laurel, Mississippi, facility. In addition, fiberglass doors are predominantly manufactured in our highly automated facility in Dickson, Tennessee, which has led to improved reliability and quality of these products.
Short set-up times, proper production scheduling and coordinated material movement are essential to achieve a flexible process capable of producing a wide range of door types, sizes, materials and styles. We make use of our vertically integrated and flexible manufacturing operations together with scalable logistics primarily through the use of common carriers to fill customers’ orders and to minimize our investment in finished goods inventory.
Finally, doors manufactured at our door assembly plants are either sold directly to our customers or transferred to our door fabrication facilities where value added services are performed. These value added services include machining doors for hinges and locksets, installing the doors into ready to install frames, installing hardware, adding glass inserts and side lites, painting and staining, packaging and logistical services to our customers.
We continued to drive operational performance through our three-prong strategy, at times using a virtual approach, which includes the Model Plant Transformation Process, Process Improvement Teams and the focus on global standards and training. Our Model Plant Transformation Process is designed to improve the throughput and the efficiency of our factories using multiple approaches such as reconfiguring equipment to enhance safety and material flow, optimizing inventory levels and implementing and tracking sustaining performance metrics. To support our Doors That Do MoreTM strategy, we continue to leverage Mvantage as our operational performance driver and have expanded the use of our Mvantage operating system throughout the enterprise and are focused on driving improvement throughout the value stream. Our focus on training has expanded to not only include our traditional kaizen facilitator training but also training that focuses on making improvements in our business process areas. We have launched Six Sigma training and are now certifying Masonite trained Green and Black Belts. At Masonite, kaizen is ingrained into our continuous improvement culture. Through this structured approach, we are driving improvements in quality and productivity while remaining focused on reliable service to our customers.
Sales and Marketing
We focus on making Masonite the brand that customers never substitute. Our curated product portfolio aligns with our customers' needs and positions us for future growth.
Multi-Level/Segment Distribution Strategy
Our sales and marketing efforts are concentrated on key initiatives designed to build a strong brand preference through creative end-user and channel marketing and a seamless purchasing experience. The targeted approach is driven by our consumer-centric research which uncovered unmet needs around the home for style, comfort, safety, and convenience. 
We market and sell our products to remodeling contractors, builders, homeowners, retailers, dealers, lumberyards, commercial and general contractors and architects through well-established wholesale, retail and direct distribution channels as part of our cross-merchandising strategy. Our portfolio of brands includes Masonite®, Premdor®, Solidor®, Residor®, Nicedor®, Door-Stop InternationalTM, Harring DoorsTM, National HickmanTM, Masonite ArchitecturalTM, Graham-MaimanTM, BaillargeonTM, USA Wood DoorTM, Florida Made Door, Louisiana Millwork, and BWISM Distribution. These are among the most recognized brands in the door industry and are respected for the innovation, quality and value they provide.
In the residential market, we utilize an "All Products" merchandising strategy which provides our retail and wholesale customers access to our entire product range and the ability to leverage our branding, marketing and selling strategies. We service our big box retail customers directly from our own door fabrication facilities which provide value added services and logistics, including store direct delivery of doors and entry systems and a full complement of in-store merchandising, displays and field service. Our residential wholesale sales professionals focus on down channel initiatives designed to ensure our products are "pulled" through our North American wholesale distribution network.
Our North American architectural customers are serviced by a dedicated sales and marketing team providing architects, door and hardware distributors, general contractors and project owners a wide range of product application advice, technical specifications, and applicable compliance and regulatory certifications.
Service Innovation
We leverage our marketing, sales and customer service activities to ensure our products are strategically pulled through our multiple distribution channels rather than deploying a more common, tactical "push" strategy. Regardless of channel, our marketing approach is to drive demand for our doors and door systems for the solutions they provide for the people who pass through them every day.
Our proprietary web-based tools provide our channel customers with direct access to a wide range of information and materials to make it easier for them to sell our products. Within our North American Residential business, these tools include Mconnect®, an online service portal providing our customers access to several other e-commerce tools designed to enhance the manufacturer-customer relationship. Once connected to our system, customers have secure access to Masonite products; the Product Corner, a section advising customers of the features and benefits of our newest products; the Media Library, a comprehensive supply of marketing materials and self-service resources; and Order Tracker, which allows customers to follow their purchase orders through the production process and confirm delivery dates. 
Our Solidor® and Door-Stop International websites are fully functional configuration and order platforms that support our entry door customers in the United Kingdom. The dynamic integration of Solidor's and Door-Stop's enterprise resource planning systems and their websites ensure that the products customers view, configure and order are available, which ensures that we are able to deliver on our promise of dependable lead-times.
In our Architectural business, our cloud-based door configurator, DoorBuilderTM Live, enables customers to select and order the right door easily and intuitively. Additionally, our DoorUniversity training program helps architects select solutions to meet their project and client goals while earning American Institute of Architect continuing education units.
Intellectual Property
In North America, our doors are marketed primarily under the Masonite® brand. Other North American brands include: Premdor®, Masonite Architectural®, Barrington®, Oakcraft®, Sta-Tru® HD, Vistagrande®, Flagstaff®, Hollister®, Sierra®, Fast-Frame®, Safe ’N Sound®, Livingston®, AquaSeal®, Cheyenne®, Riverside®, Fast-Fit®, Megantic®, Lemieux Doors®, Harring Doors®, FyreWerks® and Marshfield-Algoma®. In Europe, doors are marketed under the Masonite®, Premdor®, Premdor Speed Set®, Door-Stop International®, National Hickman®, Defining Spaces®, Solidor®, Residor® and Nicedor® brands. We consider the use of trademarks and trade names to be important in the development of product awareness, and for differentiating products from competitors and between customers. 
We protect the intellectual property that we develop through, among other things, filing for patents in the United States and various foreign countries. In the United States, we currently have 297 design patents and design patent applications and 126 utility patents and patent applications. We currently have 201 foreign design patents and patent applications and 187 foreign utility patents and patent applications. Our United States utility patents are generally applicable for 20 years from the earliest filing date, our United States design patents for 15 years and our United States registered trademarks and tradenames are generally applicable for 10 years and are renewable. Our foreign patents and trademarks have terms as set by the particular country, although trademarks generally are renewable.
Distribution
Residential doors are primarily sold through wholesale and retail distribution channels.
•Wholesale. In the wholesale channel, door manufacturers sell their products to homebuilders, contractors, lumberyards, dealers and building products retailers in two steps or one step. Two-step distributors typically purchase doors from manufacturers in bulk and customize them by installing windows, or "lites", and pre-hanging them. One-step distributors sell doors directly to homebuilders and remodeling contractors who install the doors.
•Retail. The retail channel generally targets consumers and smaller remodeling contractors who purchase doors through retail home centers, both in store and online, and smaller specialty retailers. Retail home centers offer large, warehouse size retail space with large selections, while specialty retailers are niche players that focus on certain styles and types of doors.
Architectural doors are primarily sold through specialized one-step wholesale distribution channels where distributors sell to general contractors and end-use clients.
Customers
During fiscal year 2022, we sold our products worldwide to approximately 6,500 customers. We have developed strong relationships with these customers through our "All Products" cross merchandising strategy. Our vertical integration facilitates our "All Products" strategy with our door fabrication facilities in particular providing value-added fabrication and logistical services to our customers, including store delivery of pre-hung interior and exterior doors to our customers in North America. All of our top 20 customers have purchased doors from us for at least 10 years.
Although we have a large number of customers worldwide, our largest customer, The Home Depot, accounted for approximately 22% of our total net sales in fiscal year 2022. Due to the depth and breadth of the relationship with this customer, which operates in multiple North American geographic regions and which sells a variety of our products, our management believes that this relationship is likely to continue.
Competition
The North American door industry is highly competitive and includes a number of global and local participants. In the North American residential interior door industry, the primary participants are Masonite and JELD-WEN, which are the only vertically integrated manufacturers of molded door facings. There are also a number of smaller competitors in the residential interior door industry, including Steves and Sons Inc. and Lynden Door, Inc., that primarily source door facings from third party suppliers. In the North American residential exterior door industry, the primary participants are Masonite, JELD-WEN, Plastpro, Therma-Tru, Feather River and Steves and Sons Inc. In the North American non-residential building construction door industry, the primary participants are Masonite and VT Industries with the remainder supplied by multiple regional manufacturers. Our primary market in Europe is the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom door industry is similarly competitive, including a number of global and local participants. The primary participants in the United Kingdom are our subsidiary Premdor, JELD-WEN, Vicaima and Distinction Doors. Competition in these markets is primarily based on product quality, design characteristics, brand awareness, serviceability, distribution capabilities and value. We also face competition in the other countries in which we operate. 
A significant portion of our net sales are sold to large home centers and other large retailers. The consolidation of our customers and our reliance on fewer larger customers has increased the competitive pressures as some of our largest customers, such as The Home Depot, perform periodic product line reviews to assess their product offerings and suppliers.
We are one of the largest manufacturers of molded door facings in the world. Competition in the molded door facing business is based on quality, price, product design, logistics and customer service. We produce molded door facings to meet our own requirements, and outside of North America we serve as an important supplier to the door industry at large.
Human Capital Resources
Our Company culture is based upon a strong set of values. Our Cultural Pillars define how we act and interact, both as individuals and as an organization. They reflect the environment we create where people are empowered, collaborative and focused on doing the right thing for our customers, teammates, shareholders, suppliers and communities in which we work.
Our workforce includes over 10,000 employees and contract personnel located in nine different countries. This includes approximately 2,600 unionized employees, approximately 80% of whom are located in North America with the remainder in various foreign locations. Nine of our North American facilities have individual collective bargaining agreements, which are negotiated locally and the terms of which vary by location.
Our Company’s Purpose: We Help People Walk Through WallsSM, is reflected in our talent strategy that is focused on attracting and selecting exceptional talent, helping them develop and grow professionally and providing opportunities to recognize and reward their performance in order to engage and retain our skilled, diverse and motivated workforce. We focus on the employee experience, removing barriers to inclusion, in an effort for our people to realize their full potential and highest levels of performance. We aspire to be the employer of choice within our markets we operate and seek to grow and develop the different capabilities and skills we need for the future, while maintaining a robust pipeline of available talent throughout the organization. 
We embrace the diversity of our employees and our customers, including their unique backgrounds, experiences and talents. In 2021, we furthered our progress towards a more equitable and inclusive workforce by forming a corporate Diversity Council and five regional Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") councils representing Canada, the United States, Chile, Mexico and the United Kingdom/Ireland regions. These councils are comprised of cross-functional individuals and leaders from across their respective regions that represent various diversity demographics and assist in driving forward DEI initiatives and programming. In 2022, our diversity strategy was further enhanced with the establishment of employee affinity groups that provide a place of belonging, support and allyship for employees. At Masonite, everyone is valued and appreciated for their unique contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop, engage and retain diverse talent at every level. We monitor engagement in part through a voluntary turnover metric as our goal is to retain a highly engaged team, thereby reducing voluntary turnover year over year. During fiscal year 2022, our voluntary employee turnover rate for employees in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom was approximately 21%, a reduction of approximately 300 bps from 2021. These locations collectively make up 83% of our 
global workforce. We also track 12-month retention rates, which have improved over time. At the end of 2022, our combined hourly employee retention rate in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom was over 85% across all locations.
We use a variety of methods to listen to our employees and capture their feedback. These methods include all-employee calls, focus groups, employee and manager forums, town hall meetings and an annual company-wide employee engagement survey. Our annual employee engagement survey is conducted by an external analytics and advisory firm. In 2022, the employee response rate increased by 5% to our highest-ever rate of 90% with six facilities having a 100% response rate. Since we initially administered the survey in 2017, our mean results have increased each year, reaching 3.75 out of 5.00 in 2022.
In support of our Company's purpose, in 2021 we launched a quarterly grant program to provide funding to assist individuals, organizations and causes in the communities where we live and work. Our We Help People Walk Through Walls Community Grant Program provides funding for the organizations our employees care about most in their local communities. To date, the program has awarded over $180,000 in community grants to 50 different causes. 
We believe that safety is as important to our success as productivity and quality. This is reflected in our goal of Target Zero injuries and our continued effort to create an injury-free workplace. We also believe that incidents can be prevented through proper management, employee involvement, standardized operations and equipment and attention to detail. Safety programs and training are provided throughout the company to ensure employees and managers have effective tools to help identify and address both unsafe conditions and at-risk behaviors. 
Through a continued commitment to improve our safety performance, we have historically been successful in reducing the number of injuries sustained by our employees. In 2022 our total incident rate, or the annual number of injuries per 100 full time equivalent employees, increased nominally. While our total incident rate remains well below the industry average, our ambition is to advance workplace safety by striving toward our ultimate goal of zero harm operations or Target Zero.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
Under our sustainability approach, we plan to set a carbon reduction target aligned to the latest climate science by the end of fiscal year 2024 and responsibly source 100% of our wood by 2030. In 2022 we continued to develop a comprehensive carbon reduction strategy to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. This strategy is centered on reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing our renewable energy supply and improving overall operational efficiencies. We released a Global Wood Sourcing Policy that reinforces our commitment to sourcing products and materials responsibly, and outlines expectations of our responsibly sourced wood goal. 
We strive to minimize any adverse environmental impact our operations might have to our employees, the general public and the communities of which we are a part. Reducing waste and conserving resources is core to our business. We continually look for opportunities to divert our manufacturing waste from landfills by recycling material back into the process or for beneficial use as a byproduct. We evaluate our entire manufacturing process, from supply sourcing to shipping, to identify ways to conserve natural resources and reduce solid waste, wastewater and air emissions.
We are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. The geographic breadth of our facilities subjects us to environmental laws, regulations and guidelines in a number of jurisdictions, including, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Chile and Malaysia. Such laws, regulations and guidelines relate to, among other things, the discharge of contaminants into water and air and onto land, the storage and handling of certain regulated materials used in the manufacturing process, waste minimization, the disposal of wastes and the remediation of contaminated sites. Many of our products are also subject to various regulations such as building and construction codes, product safety regulations, health and safety laws and regulations and mandates related to energy efficiency.
The Mvantage lean operating system is rooted in the lean principle of waste elimination and teaches employees throughout Masonite the skills to help identify and eliminate sources of waste including defects, over-processing and transportation. By identifying and eliminating waste, we are creating a safer, more efficient and productive operation.
Our efforts to ensure environmental compliance include the review of our operations on an ongoing basis utilizing in-house staff and on a selective basis by specialized environmental consultants. The Environmental, Health 
and Safety team participates in industry groups to monitor developing regulatory actions and actively develop comments on specific issues. Furthermore, for our prospective acquisition targets, environmental assessments are conducted as part of our due diligence review process. Based on recent experience and current projections, environmental protection requirements and liabilities are not expected to have a material effect on our business, capital expenditures, operations or financial position.
In addition to the various environmental laws and regulations, our operations are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the presence of hazardous materials and protection of worker health and safety, consumer protection, trade, labor and employment, tax and others. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable laws and regulations affecting our operations. Environmental laws have changed rapidly in recent years, and we may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. It is possible our operations may result in noncompliance with, or liability for remediation pursuant to, environmental laws. Should such eventualities occur, we would record liabilities for remediation costs when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors: "Environmental requirements and other government regulation may impose significant environmental and legal compliance costs and liabilities on us."
History and Reporting Status
Masonite was founded in 1925 in Laurel, Mississippi, by William H. Mason, to utilize vastly available quantities of sawmill waste to manufacture a usable end product. 
After a series of transformational corporate activity, on March 16, 2009, Masonite International Corporation and several affiliated companies, voluntarily filed to reorganize. Additionally, Masonite International Corporation and Masonite Inc. (the former parent of the Company) and all of its U.S. subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware. On June 9, 2009, we emerged from reorganization proceedings under the CCAA in Canada and under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the United States.
Effective July 4, 2011, pursuant to an amalgamation under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), Masonite Inc. amalgamated with Masonite International Corporation to form an amalgamated corporation named Masonite Inc., which then changed its name to Masonite International Corporation.
On September 9, 2013, our shares commenced listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "DOOR" and we became subject to periodic reporting requirements under the United States federal securities laws. We are currently not a reporting issuer, or the equivalent, in any province or territory of Canada and our shares are not listed on any recognized Canadian stock exchange. 
Our United States executive offices are located at 1242 E. 5th Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33605 and our Canadian executive offices are located at 2771 Rutherford Road, Concord, Ontario L4K 2N6.
