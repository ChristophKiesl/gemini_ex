Item 1. Business
Who We Are
Boxed is an e-commerce retailer and an e-commerce enabler. Our mission is to help the world stock up through our technology. We operate an e-commerce Retail service that provides bulk pantry consumables to businesses and household customers. This service is powered by our own purpose-built storefront, marketplace, analytics, fulfillment, advertising, and robotics technologies. We further enable e-commerce through our newly developed Software & Services business, which offers customers in need of an enterprise-level e-commerce platform access to our end-to-end technology.
Founded in 2013 by an experienced group of technology pioneers, we have been a technology-first organization since our inception. The founders (including current Chief Executive Officer Chieh Huang and current Chief Operating Officer Jared Yaman) had a simple idea: make shopping for bulk, household essentials easy, convenient and fun so customers can focus their time and energy on the things that really matter, instead of spending their weekends traveling to and shopping in traditional brick and mortar wholesale clubs with their families. From that initial concept, we grew into the e-commerce technology company that we are today, with our own purpose-built storefront, analytics, fulfillment, advertising, and robotics technologies. Since our founding, we have prioritized building a flexible end-to-end e-commerce software, which allows us to fully control the experience for our end-customers, and to ultimately provide the technological foundation from which we can drive high margin revenue through our Software & Services business. Finally, we have consistently conducted our business through an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) lens, committed to doing right by our customers, employees, and society - this commitment has become cemented with our brand. While we love being known for delivering household essentials such as toilet paper, snacks, and cleaning products, underneath the surface, we believe we are so much more.
What we offer to our customers, vendors, and other partners:
•E-commerce shopping platform for bulk-sized consumables: Through our Retail segment, we offer our customers a highly curated assortment of household and office pantry items (e.g., paper products, snacks, beverages, cleaning supplies, etc.). We accept orders through our boxed.com web and app properties, operate fulfillment centers to pick and pack those orders, and partner with last-mile carriers to deliver our assortment directly to our customers’ doorsteps within one to three days, on average. Today, our assortment offering, excluding items from our third-party marketplace, is approximately 2,500 items and is focused on highly predictable, repeat, bulk consumables, which enables us to deliver a unique user experience. While we expect to continue to expand our assortment, we will maintain a highly curated selection, providing customers with an interface design that is not overly burdensome with an endless number of products, but rather, is easy to use, and is highly personalized to help guide them through the shopping experience. Because of the flexibility of our technology, our offering resonates with a diverse set of end-customers, including individuals and households (“B2C” customers), as well as enterprises and small to medium sized businesses (“B2B” customers).
•E-commerce on-demand grocery delivery in select markets: Through our recent acquisition of MaxDelivery in December 2021, we now offer a one-hour on-demand grocery delivery service in select zip-codes within Manhattan. MaxDelivery's assortment offering includes a broader set of approximately 10,000 SKUs across grocery categories, and provides customers with access to fresh fish, meats, produce, dairy, and other perishable categories which Boxed has not historically offered broadly. MaxDelivery provides its customers a one-stop-shop for kitchen needs, which also helps drive large average order values of approximately $100, differentiating it from other fast-delivery competitors. The acquisition has marked Boxed's entry point into the rapidly growing fast-delivery space, and broadens its capabilities in micro dark-store fulfillment and fresh supply chain. 
•Vendor advertising and data offerings: Our vendors, manufacturers and other partners can purchase and deploy ads to their customers through the native advertisement function of our e-commerce platform. We further partner with vendors through our vendor portal Boxed IQ product offering, which provides insights into aggregated customer data, including sales, demographics, and purchasing behavior. Boxed IQ provides our vendors with useful data so that they can understand the return on investment of advertising campaigns in real-time. We believe this holistic offering makes us the preferred partner for many of our vendors across the landscape of consumer packaged goods (“CPG”).
•Software licensing: We have created a unique end-to-end technology platform to operate our e-commerce Retail marketplace. We believe this technology offers high value to enterprise retailers seeking to improve their omnichannel capabilities. We now offer the ability to license this technology through our Software & Services business, providing customers with a full suite of white-labeled (removal of the Boxed name and logo to rebrand products for client use) e-commerce software technology solutions.
We view our two business segments, Boxed Retail and Boxed Software & Services as highly cohesive and complementary business lines. The same technology that powers our Retail marketplace is leveraged for our Software & Services segment, and the customer funnel from each segment provides opportunity for constant iteration and improvement across both lines of business.
Finally, while we remain vigilant in driving business performance, we are highly focused on initiatives that span beyond the bottom line. We pride ourselves in being committed to doing right by our customers, employees, and society, and this commitment has become cemented with our brand. We believe the success of this business strategy is best supported by our combined B2B and B2C average order value (“AOV”) of approximately $110 per order, and our Net Promoter Score of 68, based on a regularly-scheduled survey of approximately 20,000 Boxed users we conducted during the year ended December 31, 2021. The convenience of a curated, mobile-first, simple shopping experience promotes high AOVs. This, combined with the strength of our brand, our artificial intelligence and robotics-driven technology, and our B2B capabilities, helps set us apart from industry peers.
Our Industry and Opportunity
Industry
We currently operate in the rapidly growing market for online groceries, with an emphasis on a curated assortment of bulk household consumables. This emphasis provides a point of differentiation from competitors who are primarily focused on brick and mortar sales, or who sell an outsized assortment of retail products, including electronics, clothing, furniture, and other non-consumable categories. In 2021, we serviced approximately 400,000 customers across our Retail segment, including B2B and B2C customer bases. Our B2C customers are the core of our business and we place a large focus on capturing households underserved by traditional bulk retailers, such as those located in rural areas and small towns. Our B2B customers are comprised of small and medium-sized business (“SMBs”) as well as large, blue-chip enterprises. Today, our B2B customers span a range of industry sectors, including hospitality/travel, technology and education, and we see an opportunity to further diversify into additional sectors to facilitate growth.
We believe that the growth in our B2C customer base has been aided by the shift to online household and grocery purchases that were accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we believe that post-pandemic behavior will continue to reflect the steady growth of online household and grocery purchases as customers continue to place an increased emphasis on convenience and safety. However, concurrent with the bolstering of our B2C customer base, the pandemic resulted in a meaningful decline of our B2B customer base, as many of those customers shifted to work-from-home or remote environments when COVID-19 related restrictions took hold. We expect that as B2B customers return to work, we will see a recovery from our B2B customer base in 2022 and beyond.
Additionally, we are expanding our monetization opportunities by white-labeling (removing the Boxed name and logo to rebrand products for client use) and selling our e-commerce technology platform through our Software & Services business. We believe our end-to-end technology products and the components that power it can be leveraged by any retailer who is looking to improve its online or omnichannel service offering.
Overall, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the shifts happening across the e-commerce landscape, as retailers, grocers, and CPG manufacturers alike, seek ways to modernize their omnichannel technology and operations. This need has only been accelerated further by the COVID-19 global pandemic. In February 2021, we signed our first enterprise software development and licensing contract with AEON Integrated Business Services Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEON Co., Ltd. (“AEON”), a related party, a multinational retailer and mall operator based in Japan, to provide e-commerce storefront, marketplace, last-mile, inventory management, order management, and back-end business operations technologies to their Malaysian affiliate. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to expand our Software & Services business to other global retail clients, particularly in emerging markets throughout Southeast Asia and the Middle East and Africa regions.
Within our Software & Services business, our current sales efforts are primarily focused on other large enterprise retailers with complex omnichannel operations. However, we ultimately view our technology offering as flexible and modular, with an ability to service smaller enterprise and mid-sized businesses over time. Our platform is built by operators, for use by operators - the technology is designed to solve the problems that we have experienced first-hand, so that other companies don’t have to.
Our Platform
Our comprehensive proprietary e-commerce technology platform is the core of our operations. Our customer-facing website and apps, inventory management system, order management system and fulfillment robotics hardware are all built in-house. 
Storefront:
Our e-commerce storefront’s user experience (“UX”) design and user interface (“UI”) design offer a guided, easy to use, customized experience with robust data-driven customer profiles driving engagement and conversion. Management believes conversion is also aided by a seamless browsing, discovery, and checkout experience, supporting a reduced shopping cart abandonment, and an outsized AOV compared to peers.
Our shopping experience captures evolving customer demand through data science-informed product presentation and assortment curation, enabling customers to shop conveniently and find the products they are looking for. Personalized user experiences and analytics provide actionable intelligence on who the customers are, what they are likely to purchase and how often they are likely to order, allowing us to guide each customer’s shopping experience. Not only does this allow us to guide the shoppers to the products they are most likely to purchase, it also enables us to make personalized product suggestions and provide free samples to encourage upsell and to facilitate the basket building process. This degree of UX personalization helps drive conversion and high AOV.
Business Operations:
Our business operations solutions leverage real-time data and robust tools to manage business operations, enabling efficient and profitable growth. With real-time insight into the fully burdened profitability of each individual order, we can tool our machine learning models with a layer of information and control that enables true operational optimizations, informed by the additional layer of financial performance implications.
Our built in-house marketing attribution features coupled with a personalized customer relationship management system provide customers with a unique, predictive experience, from the first time they shop until they become a customer for life. Overall, we are able to leverage robust data and insights to power smart business decisions.
Logistics and Fulfillment Centers:
We fulfill our first-party orders throughout the lower 48 states in the U.S. from three centralized fulfillment centers, deliberately located near major regional shipping corridors. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 90% of orders have delivery availability within two days or less. Through our December 2021 acquisition of MaxDelivery, we also added a fourth micro dark-store facility in Manhattan which offers one-hour on-demand delivery in select zip codes, an offering we expect to scale to additional markets in 2022 and beyond.
We also utilize proprietary fulfillment technology, including our carton optimization algorithm and proprietary robotics, developed in-house. Fulfillment automation takes wasted inefficient movement out of the fulfillment process, making sure that we can get products to our customers as efficiently as possible. This, coupled with a longer tenured hourly workforce, drives meaningful fulfillment efficiencies. Our ability to deliver products to customers is based on a flexible, cohesive fulfillment and logistics platform. Our physical fulfillment and logistics platform works seamlessly with our front-end storefront and back-end analytics, creating a streamlined supply chain enabled by end-to-end data.
This holistic data system also enables an integrated and streamlined supply chain. It allows us to scale real-time inventory via machine learning. It also provides us with the ability to pre-receive and pre-sell inventory, which proved to be a beneficial capability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we can provide our customers with supply chain transparency by displaying information like product expiration dates to our customers on-site in real time. Overall, our platform allows us to operate at optimal inventory levels, increasing inventory efficiency, and to provide ultimate transparency to our end customer.
A key to maintaining our logistics efficiencies comes from our ability to continue to scale our distribution footprint as we grow. Due to our robotics technologies, management estimates that it can deploy new fulfillment centers with full fulfillment platform integration in approximately 30 days at a cost of approximately $1.0 million. Once operational, there is an approximately thirty to forty-five-day payback period for these new fulfillment centers, assuming they are operating at full capacity utilization and with gross margin profitability consistent with the fourth quarter of 2021.
Product and Services Overview
We have a diversified set of offerings marketed and sold to B2C and B2B customers, vendors, and enterprise retailers. Those offerings include the following:
Boxed Retail Marketplace Offerings:
•Nationally Branded Products: The majority of our product assortment portfolio consists of nationally branded products which are purchased directly from CPG manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Kraft Heinz, Kellogg’s and Coca-Cola, among others. Inventory is purchased from these manufacturers, warehoused in our fulfillment centers, and then resold to our customers through our e-commerce Retail marketplace. In 2021 on our boxed.com web and app properties, we sold a curated assortment of approximately 2,500 unique SKUs (excluding third-party merchandise), generally focused on wholesale channel or bulk-quantity goods (i.e., a 36 pack of paper towels vs. a 12 pack). We expect to expand our assortment category depth and breadth to help drive future growth, but we remain committed to delivering a curated and limited-SKU assortment experience for our customers.
•Private Label Products: In addition to the nationally branded products sold through Boxed, we offer unique, loyalty-building private label products. Through our premium private brand “Prince & Spring”, we offer approximately 125 SKUs in a variety of product categories, from household cleaning and paper products, to fruit snacks and pet treats, with plans to further diversify and expand our offering. High quality products, combined with strong relative value, result in private brand loyalty from our customer base, with 56% of orders from repeat customers containing a Prince & Spring product during 2021. In 2021, net product sales of Prince & Spring represented 13% of total net product sales, but just 5% of total SKU count. With a 680 basis point margin advantage over our nationally branded products, we believe our private label products will be long-term drivers of revenue, customer retention, and profitability.
•On-Demand Grocery Delivery through MaxDelivery: In addition to the nationally branded and private label products sold through our boxed.com web and app properties, we are in the process of expanding our perishable and fresh assortment offering to our customers. Through our recent acquisition of MaxDelivery in December 2021, customers within select zip-codes in Manhattan now have access to additional assortment of approximately 10,000 SKUs across a broad range of grocery categories, including fresh fish, meats, produce, dairy, and other perishable categories which Boxed has not historically offered broadly. The acquisition also expands our fulfillment capabilities, and fulfillment delivery options for our end-customers within serviceable markets. Customers ordering from MaxDelivery can receive their groceries scheduled on-demand, delivered directly to their doors through its one-hour delivery service. We plan to expand the MaxDelivery model into additional select markets over time.
•Vendor Product Suite Offerings: In addition to the purchasing of their goods, we also offer our vendors, suppliers, and CPG manufacturers the ability to advertise their products to our customers and access customer data and feedback in real-time. We provide this service through our content management suite, programmatic “cost-per-click” ad-platform, and vendor portal data suite called Boxed IQ. Since 2018, our advertising suite provides vendors and partners with opportunities to drive a 3-6x return on ad spend (on average), with Boxed IQ supplementing that investment with aggregated customer data to help enable insights into sales trends, general customer demographics, and purchasing behavior, so that each future dollar invested can be more informed than the last. We believe this holistic offering makes us the preferred partner for many of our vendors across the CPG landscape.
•Third-Party Marketplace: We are in the process of expanding our third-party marketplace offering, which will enable third-party sellers to sell to our customers through the Boxed marketplace, without the need for us to take on inventory overhang associated with first-party resale vendor relationships. In 2021, we sold approximately 1,000 unique SKUs through inventory listed through our third-party sellers, which we expect will continue to expand in 2022 and beyond. We believe this offering will allow us to expand assortment, limit inventory risk, and drive higher conversion and a better experience for our customers.
Boxed Software & Services Offerings:
•Software & Services: After years and millions of dollars of investment in developing our technology platform, we have begun to monetize our e-commerce expertise. We believe we have created one of the few omnichannel technology platforms that is vertically integrated from our front-end storefront software to the inventory and order management systems and all the way to the fulfillment center automation and robotics. We have begun marketing and offering portions of our software technology externally through licensing agreements to other retailers, DTC manufacturers, and marketplace operators, either as a full suite of products or as individual components. In February 2021 we signed our first enterprise software development and licensing contract with AEON, an $80 billion multinational retailer and mall operator based in Japan. Yuki Habu, a member of our Board, is affiliated with AEON. In addition to our licensing agreement with AEON, we have executed non-binding term sheets with two additional potential customers and are in active discussions with a pipeline of other potential customers.
Who We Serve
Boxed provides our customers with a seamless shopping experience for both nationally branded products as well as products from our private label brand, “Prince & Spring”. Our customers are seeking a high-value, convenient and reliable source for everyday consumables and we have designed both our assortment and user experience to suit their needs.
B2C Customers
B2C customers represent the large majority of customers in our Retail business base. They visit Boxed because we offer a simple, efficient and cost-effective way to stock up on everyday bulk household essentials. These customers are often highly engaged, repeat customers. Our B2C customers purchase on average eight items in a typical basket, have an AOV of $102, and during fiscal year 2021, made up 87% of our combined B2C and B2B customer Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”). GMV is defined as the total basket value of goods sold on our platform, gross of any promotions, discounts, credits or rewards used but inclusive of service fees and taxes. 
Boxed Up:
Our B2C service is complemented by our paid loyalty program called Boxed Up. For $49.00 a year, Boxed Up members receive exclusive vendor-funded discounts and samples, free shipping on all eligible orders, and cash back credited for future purchases. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 33,000 Boxed Up members. During the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to an average B2C customer, Boxed Up members ordered 2.2x as frequently and spent approximately 215% more. Furthermore, during this same period, 20% of our GMV was generated by Boxed Up customers and we plan to grow membership significantly, helping to further bolster engagement and retention from our B2C customers.
B2B Customers
Our B2B customers, which include corporations and SMBs, enjoy procuring the high-quality bulk goods needed to run their businesses through an easy to navigate and convenient marketplace UI/UX. We offer our B2B customers a seamless buying experience powered by digital capabilities like multi-user accounts, flexible payment and invoicing, reporting and analytics, fast customer service and sales support response times, custom enterprise portals and rapid e-procurement integration. We supplement this experience with tech integration and higher agility relative to big-box B2B retailers, providing customization to individual customer needs. We use our proprietary logistics technology to round out our B2B experience, delivering products to B2B customers quickly and cost effectively. Most products are shipped within one to three business days at competitive rates.
Prior to 2020, GMV from our B2B customer base was the fastest growing component of our Retail business and a high-performing line relative to B2C. While the COVID-19 global pandemic temporarily impacted our positive B2B channel trends, with fewer people working in offices and lower levels of domestic and global travel, we began to see a rebound in the second half of 2021, and expect this trend upward to continue as employees return to work, and the travel and hospitality industries return to full operations post COVID-19. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our B2B customers had an AOV of $214, which is higher than the AOV for our B2B customers for year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe future growth will be driven by investment into several core areas of our business:
B2C Expansion
•We believe our B2C customer channel is poised for dynamic growth. We see an opportunity to expand our product assortment into the areas most requested by our customers, including healthy/organic, pet and home. We expect expanding our assortment will allow us to increase the wallet share (the amount of customer total spend on grocery and consumable products spent on the Boxed platform) we capture from our customers. We believe the Boxed third-party marketplace technology will further facilitate our product expansion in a capital-efficient manner. Further, as we expand the operations of MaxDelivery and the on-demand grocery delivery service to more markets, we will be able to further complement our product offering through delivery of fresh assortment to a larger percentage of our customer base, something that has historically yielded increased order frequency and customer loyalty.
•We also believe there are multiple methods to drive increased customer loyalty, such as expanding the Boxed Up loyalty program, as well as expanded private label SKU count. We believe that there is an opportunity to not just improve existing customer loyalty, but also to expand wallet share with new customers soon after they start using our platform. Finally, we are also testing further expansion of our auto-ship subscription business, which provides regular automated replenishment opportunities with additional discounts for Boxed customers, in the same efficient model that we perfected with our basket-building technology.
•Finally, we will look to expand investment into advertising campaigns to drive new customer traffic and brand awareness. This investment will help drive accelerated growth through customer additions.
B2B Expansion
•We believe the rebound from the COVID-19 global pandemic will provide meaningful organic tailwinds for B2B customers, and that we can take additional steps to further capitalize on this momentum. Traditionally, we have largely relied on organic word of mouth growth for our B2B customer offering. We believe that we can accelerate growth within our B2B customer base by expanding our sales force and by targeting new attractive sectors such as education/non-profit, technology, and hospitality. We also want to provide the best experience for those customers coming to the platform. To accomplish this, we plan to optimize our assortment on the B2B platform by tailoring the product mix to what our SMB and enterprise customers need.
Monetization of Proprietary Technology
Native Ad Platform:
Our ad technology platform empowers sellers and vendors to speak to the right customers at the right time. We currently offer in-house, scalable, programmatic advertising software designed to unlock a high-margin revenue stream, while providing our vendors with access to the most highly sought after customers. We believe our ad platform provides differentiated access to customers at the point of conversion, providing real-time transparent reporting, which is all offered through a streamlined self-service vendor portal. We offer seamless implementation and a dedicated team to guide our advertising customers through the process. While ad technology revenue as a percentage of our total net revenue was less than 1% in fiscal year 2021, our vendors experienced return on ad spend of 3-6x in the same time period.
Software Licensing:
At Boxed, we have created one of the few omnichannel technology platforms that is vertically integrated from our front-end storefront software to the inventory and order management systems and all the way to the fulfillment center automation and robotics. We have the ability to offer these modularized e-commerce and fulfillment technologies through licensing agreements to other retailers, direct-to-customer manufacturers, and marketplace operators, either as a full suite of products or as individual product solutions; the technology can also be white-labeled and localized for foreign deployment. These offerings can range from inventory management software, our proprietary advertising technology systems, or other back-end operational support. Management believes we are differentiated from our competition, whose systems are typically fractured, more expensive, and have slower implementation times. Our competition is also generally focused solely on building the software, rather than also leveraging it to run their own businesses. Boxed offers a single, cohesive, cost-effective platform, built by operators, and we prioritize speed to market.
Growing AOVs
From fiscal year 2017 through December 31, 2021, our customers on average increased their AOV by greater than 25% from their initial order to their tenth order with Boxed. We believe this trend of growing AOVs is an important customer lifecycle dynamic because it helps illustrate further customer engagement with new categories and products as they age with us, and illustrates that our personalization and simple user experience help enable shopper discovery.
As we expand assortment through both new categories and SKUs, we anticipate that both our AOV and order frequency will also continue to expand, as customers find more products they know and love on the Boxed platform.
Customer Satisfaction
The experience of our customers is core to our decision making at Boxed, and a large part of our success can be tied to the high level of recorded customer satisfaction. Our customers’ satisfaction is reflected in our net promoter score of 68 as of the year period ended December 31, 2021. Our higher level of customer satisfaction can, in part, be attributed to a unique user experience that drives customer loyalty.
We believe a better experience, with efficient fulfillment and award-winning customer service, yields highly satisfied customers.
Culture, People and Human Capital
Boxed is a brand known for doing right for our customers, employees and society, with policies that go beyond the bottom line. Our ESG principles are embedded in the core of our business model and are front and center in the way we run our business. We value all members of our team and provide them with strong benefits and workplace offerings, boosting loyalty and efficiency. These benefits include providing our full-time fulfillment center hourly staff with an option for fully subsidized medical insurance coverage and a benefits program designed to provide financial relief in times of unforeseen hardship or significant life events. We believe this approach is not only the right thing to do, but it also drives efficiency and team loyalty; our hourly team members staffing Boxed fulfillment centers have an average tenure of over two years.
We view ourselves as champions of diversity. Over half of our corporate office team nationwide identifies as an ethnic minority, yielding diverse thought within the Boxed family. Our team embodies a diverse mix of backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 250 full-time employees across our New York headquarters and San Mateo, California office, as well as our fulfillment centers in New Jersey, Texas and Nevada. In addition to full-time employees, our workforce is supplemented by temporary staff in the fulfillment centers, as well as a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) which supports staffing for the operations of BoxedMax LLC (d/b/a MaxDelivery). None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be positive. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees.
Competition
We operate in the competitive and rapidly growing online consumables market, an evolving sub-group of the greater consumables retail sector, which we believe historically has been highly fragmented. Certain of our potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, lower costs, larger product portfolios, larger user bases, larger sales forces and a greater geographic presence, and have built relationships with retailers and distributors that may be more effective than ours.
We believe that we have developed a full, powerful suite of proprietary, integrated technology that drives brand differentiation and cost efficiencies. We expect several industries to operate in competition with the capabilities that our comprehensive technology platform offers, which can cater to both enterprise and small business clients. Companies providing on-demand networks, third-party logistics and warehouse management systems, order management system middleware, storefront and e-commerce capabilities, and marketing, data analytics, and advertising services represent potential competitors to the Boxed technology platform.
We believe that the primary competitive factors in our market are:
•service quality and performance;
•customer purchasing experience;
•sales and distribution capabilities;
•pricing;
•customer support and service;
•effective marketing;
•brand recognition;
•breadth and depth of offerings;
•greater market penetration; and
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation.
We believe our ability to continue to compete effectively in our industry will also depend in part on our ability to respond more quickly and effectively than our peers to new or changing opportunities, technologies, regulatory standards or customer requirements. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, margins and market share.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our continued ability to provide efficient and profitable delivery of the nationally branded and private-label products that our B2C and B2B customers have come to expect from us, while continuing to grow our customer base. It will also depend on our continued and accelerating ability to monetize our technological proficiencies via our advertising technology, marketplace and software licenses, hosted in either on-premise or cloud-based infrastructure environments.
Manufacturing
We purchase all of our merchandise directly or indirectly from third-party manufacturers. Some vendors operate their own manufacturing facilities and others subcontract the manufacturing to other parties. Our manufacturers generally agree to terms that are substantially similar to our standard manufacturer terms, which govern our business relationships.
Although we do not have long-term agreements with our vendors, we have longstanding relationships with a diverse base of vendors that we believe are mutually satisfactory. We believe the nature and number of these vendors helps mitigate our supply chain risk.
All of our private-label products under the label “Prince & Spring” are required to be produced according to our specifications, and our manufacturers warrant that such products will perform in accordance with these specifications. Our manufacturing and supplier contracts are generally on year-to-year terms and generally provide us the additional right to terminate such agreements for uncured material breaches within 30 days. We require that all of our manufacturers comply with applicable law and we generally have the right to audit the suppliers’ facilities. We believe that third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs, both for our private-label products and for our third-party merchandise.
Government Regulation
Our business is, among other things, subject to laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet. Jurisdictions vary as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among other areas, apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information, or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or an inadvertent disclosure of such information. Different jurisdictions impose differing, and sometimes more stringent, consumer and privacy protections. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to us, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.” Changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our website and mobile applications and their financial results. The continued growth of and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in the creation of more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.
In addition, we are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations intended to protect public health, natural resources and the environment. Our operations, and those of our manufacturing outsourcing partners, are subject to regulation by OSHA, the FDA, the USDA, and by various other federal, state and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and import of our products, including food safety standards. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We are subject to governmental regulation and we may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulation, and our failure to comply may result in enforcements, recalls, and other adverse actions.”
Other Laws and Regulations
Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-US laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act’s (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our business is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our rights to our intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology, are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from competitors. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We own a number of trademarks that have been registered, or for which registration applications are pending, in the United States as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. These registered or pending trademarks include, among others, “Boxed”, “Bulk is Beautiful” and “An endless supply of the things you love”. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods and services. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous domain names, including boxed.com and princespring.com.
We also enter into and rely on confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and in our agreements with vendors.
Environmental Matters
Our operations and leased properties are subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non- hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information, that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our packaging, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our private-label products or packaging or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
