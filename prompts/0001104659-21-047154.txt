Covid-19 Pandemic
 
The global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and related impacts adversely affect and may continue to adversely affect business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) liquidity and cash flow.
 
The commercial aerospace industry, in particular, has been significantly disrupted, both domestically and internationally. The pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on our business in 2020. The impact of COVID-19 is fluid and continues to evolve, and the shape and speed of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remains uncertain. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when the commercial transport market, will recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels.
 
We took immediate action to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces and reduce costs. Since the early days of the pandemic, we have been following the guidance from the U.S. Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and the New York State Department of Health to protect our employees and prevent the spread of the virus within our facilities. Some of the actions implemented include: social distancing, appropriate personal protective equipment; facility deep cleaning; flexible work-from-home scheduling; pre-shift temperature screenings, and restrictions on facility visitors and unnecessary travel. Actions to reduce costs included: (1)  reducing our workforce to align operations with customer demand; (2) delaying non-essential capital projects and minimizing discretionary spending and (3) suspension of certain benefit programs.

To fill most of its orders for components, the Company must either modify a standard model or design a new product in order to satisfy the customer’s particular requirements. The Company also produces unique products based on specifications provided by its customers. The Company produces under long-term contracts and other types of orders.
 
The Company may from time to time produce metallic seals of various cross-sectional configurations. These seals fit between two surfaces, usually metal, to produce a more secure and leak-proof joint. The Company manufactures these seals to close tolerances from standard and special alloy steels. Ductile coatings are often applied to the seals in order to increase their effectiveness.
 
The Company has also produced other products of its own and/or of a given design to meet customers’ requirements.
 
Consumer Products
 
The Company designs, manufactures and sells a variety of edged products, tools and specialty consumer products for domestic and international distribution. These products include a wide range of cutlery items such as steak, carving, bread, butcher and paring knives for household use and for use in restaurants, institutions and private industry, as well as equipment and gear including fixed and folding knives for hunting, fishing and camping. The Company also sells knives and tools to the U.S. Government, related agencies, and allied foreign governments. These products include machetes, bayonets, axes, strap cutters, and other tools that are designed primarily for military and rescue/first-responder use, but are viable in commercial markets as well. The Company also produces and markets other edged products such as various specialty tools, putty knives, linoleum sheet cutters, field knives and SciMed items including scalpels and micro-spatulas. The Company manufactures its products from stainless and high carbon steels, titanium, or synthetic materials in numerous styles, designs, models and sizes. Substantially all of the Company’s commercial related products are intended for the moderate to premium priced markets. The Company also provides plastic fabrication, metal fabrication and other engineering, design, and OEM/white-label manufacturing services to regional customers. This includes the production of a wide range of machined, engineered, and/or molded consumer and industrial products and components.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Advanced Technology Products
 
The Company’s Advanced Technology Group (ATG) products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Products are primarily non-seasonal in nature. These products are sold to the United States Government, government prime contractors, government subcontractors, commercial manufacturers and end-users. Sales are made primarily by the Company’s professional staff.
 
The Company’s prime contracts and subcontracts with the United States Government, government subcontractors, and commercial manufacturers are subject to termination at the convenience of the customer. In the event of such termination, the Company is ordinarily entitled to receive payment for its costs and profits on work done prior to termination. Since the inception of the Company’s business, less than 1% of its contracts have been terminated for convenience. The Company’s sales of advanced technology products are composed primarily of a small group of customers. We have a significant concentration of business with two major customers; Customer A and Customer B. Sales to Customer A accounted for 22.3% of consolidated sales in 2020 and 35.0% of consolidated sales in 2019. Sales to Customer B accounted for 26.6% of consolidated sales in 2020 and 19.8% of consolidated sales in 2019. In both 2020 and 2019 we had a concentration of sales to Customer A and Customer B representing approximately 48.9% of our consolidated sales. Two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Approximately 27% of the 2019 units shipped to Customer B and approximately 13% of ATG total units shipped in 2019 support the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft production. Approximately 17% of the 2020 units shipped to Customer B and approximately 6% of ATG total units shipped in 2020 support the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft production. There was a significant decline of 61% in shipments to Customer B for the Boeing 737 MAX and a 38% decline in shipments to Customer B as compared to the same period in 2019. Customer A is 4% and Customer B is 81% of our drop in revenues in 2020 as compared to 2019.

As a result of the slowdown in demand for our products, we implemented several cost reduction programs. We delayed our 2021 merit increases and initiated reduced work schedules across the company and implemented permanent census reductions.
 
The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings. See Note 1, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Concentration of Credit Risks, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to sales concentrations.

The Company’s Consumer Products Group (CPG) also sells its knives and tools (principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives) to various branches of the United States Government. Additionally, the Company provides OEM and white label product design and manufacturing services to a regional customer base across a wide range of consumer and commercial industries. No single customer of the CPG represented more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales in 2020 or 2019. The Company sells its products and manufacturing services through its own sales resources, independent manufacturers’ representatives and electronic commerce.

Environmental Compliance
 
The cost of compliance with current environmental laws has not been material and the Company does not anticipate that it will be in the future.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company manufactures its advanced technology products in Elma, New York and Franklinville, New York and its consumer products in Franklinville, New York.
 
Raw Materials and Other Supplies
 
The Company purchases raw materials and certain components for its products from outside vendors. The Company is generally not dependent upon a single source of supply for any raw material or component used in its operations.
Competition
 
Although no reliable industry statistics are available to enable the Company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect to any of its products, the Company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servo-control components within its competitive market. The Company’s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant.
 
The Company has many different competitors with respect to servo-control components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products also face competition from other types of control components which, at times, can accomplish the desired result.
 
The Company encounters active competition with respect to its consumer products from numerous companies, many of which are larger in terms of manufacturing capacity, financial resources and marketing organization. Its principal competitors vary depending upon the customer and/or the products involved. The Company believes that it competes primarily with more than 20 companies with respect to its consumer products, in addition to foreign imports. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to cutlery include Corelle Brands Holdings, Inc., Benchmade Knife Company, Inc., Tramontina, Inc., Dexter-Russell Inc., W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company, Lifetime Brands, Inc., Cutco Corporation and Gerber. The Company also competes with other regional manufacturing companies for its molded plastic and metal and plastic fabrication services. To the Company’s knowledge, its principal competitors with regard to manufacturing services include PM Plastics, Monarch Plastics and Ontario Plastics.
 
The Company markets most of its products throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in select foreign markets. The Company believes that it competes in marketing its servo-control products primarily on the basis of operating performance, adherence to rigid specifications, quality, price and delivery and its consumer products primarily on the basis of price, quality and delivery.
 
Employees
 
The Company, at December 31, 2020, had 318 employees of which 316 are full time and 2 part time employees at two locations in New York. Approximately 87% of its employees and contractors are engaged in production, inspection, packaging or shipping activities. The balance is engaged in executive, engineering, administrative, clerical or sales capacities. None are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
