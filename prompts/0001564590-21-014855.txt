Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
 We are an advertising software company. Our software enables the programmatic purchase of advertising, which is the electronification of the advertising buying process. Programmatic advertising is rapidly taking market share from traditional ad sales channels, which require more staffing, offer less transparency and involve higher costs to buyers.
 Our demand side platform (“DSP”), Adelphic, is an enterprise software platform that is used by marketers and their advertising agencies to centralize the planning, buying and measurement of their advertising across most channels. Through our technology, a marketer can easily buy ads on desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, streaming audio and digital billboards.
 Our software is designed to make our customers’ lives easier by enabling marketers and their advertising agencies to plan, buy and measure advertising campaigns in a highly automated fashion. We offer an easy-to-use self-service platform that provides customers with transparency and control over their advertising campaigns.

Our platform offers customers unique visibility across inventory, allowing them to create customized audience segments and leverage our people-based and strategic partner data to reach target audiences at scale. Our platform delivers a full suite of forecasting, reporting and built-in automation that provides our customers with insights into available inventory based on the desired target audience. We offer advanced forecasting and reporting that empowers our customers with functionality designed to ensure they can accurately measure and improve their return-on-advertising spend (“ROAS”) across channels.
 Marketers use our software to deliver advertising campaigns to their desired target audience across channels and formats. Through platform integrations, we offer our customers access to omnichannel advertising inventory, which refers to media available across devices, channels and formats. This includes access to over 300 million unique desktop and mobile users, 114 million connected TVs, 112 million linear TV households, over 200 million unique digital audio users, and 158,000 unique digital billboards, in the U.S. Our platform supports a full range of transaction types including real-time bidding, private marketplace and programmatic guaranteed, allowing customers to easily source and integrate ad inventory directly from publishers and private marketplaces.
 We enable deep data access through our data integrations to authenticate user identities across a range of devices. Our matching of people-based identifiers enables us to be the nexus point with more than 70 data partners, providing customers with deep access to people-based data across market verticals such as automotive, entertainment, business to business, retail, consumer packaged goods, travel and tourism, and healthcare. Our proprietary identity graph is matched to more than 250 million users across 115 million households in the U.S., which we believe makes it one of the largest in the industry.
 Our customers are advertising buyers including large advertising holding companies, independent advertising agencies, mid-market advertising service organizations as well as marketers that rely on our self-service software platform for their programmatic ad buying needs. We are a trusted partner to our customers and have had a 95% customer satisfaction rating for the last 3 years based on Viant’s Annual Adelphic Customer Satisfaction Survey. Many of our customers use our software as their primary demand side platform.
 Our platform is built on people-based data. Using our identity resolution capabilities and identity graph, marketers and their advertising agencies can identify targeted consumers using real-world identifiers rather than relying primarily on cookies to track users. We believe the industry is shifting to a people-based framework to replace the cookie in delivering personalized advertising, particularly for identification. People-based data allows marketers to deliver personalized advertising while being able to accurately link ad impressions across multiple devices and to customer sales, letting them know what they get in return for their advertising dollars. In addition, people-based data allows consumers to know who is collecting their data and what it is being used for, and also gives them the right to delete or stop their use of data for personalized advertising. Many of our competitors rely on cookies for the targeting and measurement of digital advertising but this technology has not been effective at accurately measuring the real impact of a marketer’s ad spend on their business results. Apple’s popular web browser, Safari, currently does not allow third party cookies and Google Chrome has announced plans to entirely disallow third party cookies in their browser in early 2022. This market change has created an increase in demand by marketers actively looking for platforms like ours that offer an alternative to cookie-based tracking, which we believe is strengthening our strategic position.
 Programmatic advertising has proven its value to marketers and more organizations are devoting more of their digital ad spend to it. The digital ecosystem continues to evolve and with it programmatic advertising, creating new opportunities and needs for marketers and their agencies. The U.S. programmatic advertising market is expected to grow from $65 billion in 2018 to $140 billion in 2022, a 21% CAGR, according to eMarketer, a market research company that provides insights and trends related to digital marketing, media, and commerce. We focus on ad buyers and believe that our solutions will accelerate the shift of advertising budgets to programmatic advertising. Additionally, as marketers desire more control over programmatic advertising and move some functions of programmatic ad buying in-house, our software platform is designed to address these needs and expands our market opportunity.

Our total revenue was $165.3 million, $164.9 million and $108.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of 0.2% from 2019 to 2020 and 52.1% from 2018 to 2019. We recorded net income of $20.6 million and $9.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $31.8 million and $24.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to a net loss of $25.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of our management’s use of this measure and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income or net loss, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
 Our Industry
 We believe the key industry trends shaping the advertising market include:
 Advertising dollars shifting towards programmatic advertising: We believe the advertising industry is still in the early stages of a shift to programmatic advertising. The ability to transact through real-time-bidding platforms has evolved beyond banner advertising to be used across a wide range of advertising channels and formats, including desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, streaming audio and digital billboards. U.S. programmatic advertising is experiencing a rapid increase in adoption and, according to eMarketer, is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR from 2018 to 2022, reaching $94 billion in 2020, $118 billion in 2021 and $140 billion by 2022. U.S. programmatic advertising is forecasted to represent 48% of total U.S. media spend by 2022, increasing from 29% in 2018. The TV industry is undergoing significant disruptions as Internet-enabled connected TV has become a preferred vehicle for streaming video content. The amount of connected TV users in the U.S. is forecasted to increase from 195 million, or 59% of the U.S. population, in 2019 to 226 million, or 66% of the U.S. population, in 2024, according to eMarketer. Connected TV also provides a number of benefits to advertisers, including more accurate control of scale, addressability, and measurement. Marketers are increasingly investing in connected TV as more inventory becomes available. According to eMarketer, 51% of connected TV ad spend was transacted programmatically in 2019 and the share of programmatic will increase to nearly 60% in 2021. In addition, connected TV ad spend is expected to grow from $6 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2020 to $18 billion in 2024, a 25% CAGR.
 Strong marketer demand for Return-On-Advertising-Spend measurement across all channels: Marketers are looking for a centralized view of their customers, while connecting online and offline purchases to accurately measure ROAS. Return-on-advertising-spend is a critical metric for marketing campaigns. Insights from ROAS across all campaigns inform marketers about what they are getting for their money across all media investments near real-time. Hence, marketers seek tools to track their ROAS across all channels. We believe people-based platforms are able to provide a more accurate measurement of ROAS as compared to cookie-based platforms.
 Demand for scaled people-based platforms: Advertising has become more data driven and marketers need to be able to target audiences at the individual and household level while respecting consumer privacy. Internet advertisers in the past have capitalized on anonymous data from cookies to gain insights into users and ad performance. However, increased privacy concerns and changing requirements of browser providers including Google (Chrome) and Apple (Safari) are causing marketers to reduce their reliance on vendors and software platforms that primarily utilize cookies for device identification. In today’s connected world, marketers need to be able to identify their customers and connect with them across multiple channels, devices and formats. This is driving an industry shift away from cookie-based DSPs to scaled people-based DSPs.
 Brands directly selecting advertising software solutions: Marketers are increasingly becoming directly involved in the selection of their advertising software solutions as they seek to reduce costs, better leverage their customer data and gain more control over their advertising. These factors have also led to an increase in marketers moving programmatic ad buying functions in-house. The automation of ad-buying technology has enabled fast, accurate and cost-effective decision-making, resulting in ad buying becoming a skillset that an increasing number of Chief Marketing Officers (“CMOs”) want to fully own. According to a recent survey by IAB in 2019, 18% of U.S. brands have completely moved programmatic ad buying in-house, and 51% of U.S. brands have moved a portion of their programmatic ad buying in-house.

Our Technology and Development
 Rapid and continuing innovation is a core driver of our business success and our corporate culture. Our product and engineering team is responsible for the design, development and testing of our platform. We are committed to continuous innovation and rapid introduction of new technologies, features and functionality that bring value to our customers. We expect technology and development expense and capitalized software development costs to increase as we continue to invest in the development of our platform to support additional features and functions, such as enhancement of our user interface and automation functions, and to increase the number of advertising and data inventory integrations in various channels.
 The technical infrastructure for our platform is currently managed through third-party web hosting services providers and to a limited extent, our own servers which are located at a third-party data center facility. We generally enter into one to two year agreements with our web hosting providers.
 Our Customers
 Our customers consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory. We define an Active Customer as a customer that had total aggregate revenue ex-TAC of at least $5,000 through our platform during the previous twelve months. We had 264 and 277 Active Customers for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, in each case consisting of advertising buyers, including large advertising holding companies, independent advertising agencies, mid-market advertising service organizations as well as marketers relying on our self-service software platform for their programmatic ad buying needs. For a detailed discussion of Active Customers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics—Number of Active Customers and Average Revenue ex-TAC per Active Customer.” Revenue ex-TAC is a non-GAAP measure. For a detailed discussion of our key operating and financial performance metrics and a reconciliation of revenue ex-TAC to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Key Operating and Financial Performance Metrics—Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Many of the advertising agencies that we work with are owned by holding companies, where decision-making is generally highly decentralized such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. Our customer count includes only those parties with which we have a billing relationship. We contract with our customers either through master service agreements or insertion orders. Our agreements do not contain any material commitments on behalf of customers to use our platform to purchase ad inventory or use other features. Our agreements with customers generally do not have a specified term, and are generally terminable at any time by either party upon specified notice periods, typically ranging from 30 to 90 days. Insertion orders are generally limited in scope and can be reduced or canceled by a buyer without penalty.
 Our Advertising and Data Supply
 We obtain digital advertising inventory primarily through our integrations with supply side platforms (“SSPs”) and directly with publishers. We believe that our integrations across every channel give us the most robust omnichannel integrations of any single platform. These suppliers provide us with access to a breadth of programmatic advertising inventory across desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, streaming audio and digital billboards.
 We enable deep data access through our integrations with over 70 leading data companies, giving our customers access to data across key industry verticals, including auto, retail, consumer packaged goods, travel and health. Customers onboard their own first-party data onto our platform, without the need of a separate data management platform. Our operation of Myspace.com provides certain data assets and intellectual property that we may leverage to continue to offer innovative products and services to our clients.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our platform through a direct sales team focused on business development across all markets, including sales to new customers and revenue growth within existing customers. We have an experienced sales team of 75 sellers across the United States who are focused on selling access to our platform in our target markets, building and nurturing relationships with global brands and agencies. We use a consultative sales approach focused on educating existing and potential customers on our platform capabilities, and training clients to use our platform. We offer a formal certification program, Programmatic University and Adelphic Certification, that covers programmatic industry trends, technology capabilities and time-saving workflows and have an online knowledge base with robust documentation. We provide dedicated customer support and work with customers as they set up and optimize their campaigns, assist with delivery against key performance indicators and goals, and provide post-campaign support and recommendations.
 We tailor our contracts and terms to the needs of our customers, including by offering our three different pricing options: a percentage of spend option, a subscription option and a fixed CPM pricing option. Customers can use our platform on a self-service basis or can enlist our services to execute their campaigns.
 Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness and consideration for our brands, executing thought-leadership initiatives, participating in industry events, creating comprehensive sales support materials and generating new customer leads. We seek to accomplish these objectives by presenting at industry conferences, hosting customer conferences, publishing white papers and research, public relations activities, advertising campaigns and social media presence.
 Privacy and Data Protection
 Modern consumers use multiple platforms to learn about and purchase products and services, and consumers have come to expect a seamless experience across all channels. This challenges marketing organizations to balance the demands of the consumer and the most effective advertising techniques with responsible, privacy-compliant methods of managing data internally and with advertising technology intermediaries.

We believe strongly in providing consumers with more visibility and control over their data. We have prioritized protecting the privacy of consumers and their data and offer consumers a robust suite of tools to manage their data. We have policies and operational practices governing our use of data that are designed to actively promote a set of meaningful privacy guidelines, including advanced consumer opt-out capability, best in class security measures, encryption of data using robust industry standards, proactive identification of threats and regular penetration testing. When giving our customers access to personal data, we provide that data in a “hashed,” or de-identified, manner. We have dedicated personnel in place to oversee our compliance with the data protection regulations that govern our business activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
 The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities, have recently increased their attention on matters concerning the collection and use of consumer data, including relating to internet-based advertising. Data privacy legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and California has enacted broad-based privacy legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act. State legislatures outside of California have proposed, and in certain cases enacted, a variety of types of data privacy legislation. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions have also enacted or are developing laws and regulations governing the collection and use of personal data.
 We expect the trend of enacting and revising data protection laws to continue and that new and expanded data privacy legislation in various forms will be implemented in the U.S. and in other countries around the globe.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with smaller, privately-held companies, along with public companies such as the Trade Desk, and with divisions of large, well-established companies such as Google and Amazon. The competitive landscape in recent years has been affected by consolidation and limited investment in new startups in our industry and there are few competitors with self-service capabilities. Our long history and time in the market with customers has given us significant advantages in terms of platform development and expertise, as well as a long development lead ahead of new entrants. We believe that we compete primarily based on the performance of campaigns running on our platform, capabilities of our platform, our identity resolution capabilities, our omnichannel capabilities and our advance reporting capabilities. We believe that we are differentiated from our competitors in the following areas:
  
• | we are an independent technology company focused on serving advertising agencies and marketers on the buy-side of our industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our platform is self-service and easy to use;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | we offer our DSP in an integrated manner with our people-based capabilities, so customers do not need to use separate providers for onboarding client information and ad and data purchasing services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of inventory types across a broad range of channels;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of data partners across a broad range of industry verticals and channels to enable precise audience targeting and measurement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our identity resolution capabilities help marketers plan, buy and measure their campaigns more effectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we provide customer service and satisfaction; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | we provide flexible pricing options to support a wide variety of customers.

 Our Human Capital
 We are a founder-led business and believe our employees and culture are key to our success. Our employees tend to be long tenured for our industry, with average tenure of the leadership team of nearly 12 years and more than 4 years across all employees. Our business and our culture are anchored on four core values that embody our resourceful mentality: “Live,” “Lead,” “Create” and “Figure It Out.” We believe we attract talented employees to our company and sophisticated customers to our platform in large part because of our vision and unwavering commitment to using cutting-edge technologies to create products that help advance the advertising industry.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 289 employees in 10 offices around the United States. Our team draws from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences across technology and advertising industries.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion where all employees feel valued and included. We believe our greatest asset is the people who work for us, and as part of our investment in our people, we prioritize diversity and inclusion. Our goal is to create a culture where we value, respect, and provide fair treatment and opportunities for all employees. Each year, we conduct an annual survey to give employees the opportunity to provide feedback on our management team and culture. This survey helps drive new programs that continue the development of our inclusive culture. Our leaders review the survey feedback and work with their teams to initiate new initiatives based on the results.
 We are committed to developing a diverse environment through recruiting, development programs, community involvement and fostering conversations about differences.  
 Talent Development
 Even though Viant has been around for 20+ years, our culture still reflects an entrepreneurial spirit. We empower employees to develop their skills and abilities by following our core values and acting on great ideas regardless of their role or function. We encourage employees at all levels to be creative and come up with ideas that can help the business grow. We work to provide an environment where talented individuals and teams can take control of their career growth. We provide a wide range of learning and development opportunities in both individual and group settings.
Compensation and Benefits
 We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and reward their efforts and contributions. We use internal and external resources to help develop plans that are fair and reward our employees’ commitment and performance with the goal of attracting and retaining high performing individuals. 
 In addition to salaries, we provide competitive compensation programs that are in line with our peers and industry. These programs may include bonuses, equity awards, 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave and employee assistance programs among many others. 
 Health, Safety and Wellness
 We strive to provide a work environment where our employees feel safe and are comfortable working. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately implemented a teleworking program that complied with all applicable government regulations and protected our employees while allowing them to continue to be effective in their jobs. We continue to stay updated on changes in government regulations and implement them to meet our employees’ changing health and wellness needs.
 Intellectual Property
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the U.S. and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property.

As of December 31, 2020, we held 26 issued patents, 10 pending patent applications and 306 issued trademarks. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2025 and 2038. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. In addition to the intellectual property relating to the operation of Adelphic and our people-based framework, we own intellectual property related to our owned site, Myspace.com. Of our issued patents, 11 relate to our platform and our people-based framework, and 15 relate to the Myspace.com site.
 Corporate Information
 Viant was founded in 1999 by Tim, Chris and Russ Vanderhook who continue to lead our company today. Viant has been at the forefront of digital advertising technology since its inception and has demonstrated its ability to grow, thrive, and innovate as competitors have come and gone. In 2011, Viant acquired the social network website Myspace.com. In 2011, Tim and Chris Vanderhook started Xumo, a connected TV streaming service, which was acquired by Comcast Corp. in 2020. In 2015, Viant completed its first people-based integration. Viant remained independent until 2016, when Time Inc. acquired a 60% interest in Viant through its subsidiary, Viant Technology Holding Inc. (the “Former Holdco”). That interest was later acquired by Meredith Corporation when it acquired Time Inc. in 2018. In 2017, the Company purchased Adelphic, a DSP. Since the Adelphic acquisition, the Company has materially transformed from a full-service provider of digital advertising solutions into a leading DSP that enables marketers and their advertising agencies to centralize the planning, buying and measurement of their media investments using a people-based framework. Viant has grown from a business operating from a home office to a company with nearly 300 employees in 10 offices throughout the U.S. In 2019, Viant entered into an agreement that resulted in the retirement of the Former Holdco’s interest in Viant and Tim Vanderhook, Chris Vanderhook and Four Brothers 2 LLC (the “Vanderhook Parties”) acquired that 60% interest in the Company (the “2019 Former Holdco transaction”), allowing it to once again become an independent company. Viant Technology Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2020. In connection with the consummation of our initial public offering (the “IPO”), Viant Technology Inc. became the sole managing member of Viant Technology LLC. We completed the IPO of our Class A common stock on February 12, 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 2722 Michelson Drive, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92612 and our telephone number is (949) 861-8888. Our website address is www.viantinc.com.
