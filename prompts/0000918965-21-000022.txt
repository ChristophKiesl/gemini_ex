ITEM 1.    Business.
ScanSource, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries referred to as the "Company” or “ScanSource” or “we”) is at the center of the technology solution delivery channel, connecting businesses and providing solutions for their complex needs. Using a channel sales model, we provide technology solutions and services from leading suppliers of mobility and barcode, point-of-sale (POS), payments, physical security, unified communications and collaboration, telecom and cloud services to our customers. 
ScanSource was incorporated in South Carolina in 1992 and serves approximately 30,000 sales partners. Net sales for fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 totaled $3.15 billion. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “SCSC.” 
Our customers are businesses of all sizes that sell to end-customers across many industries. Our customer channels include value-added resellers (“VARs”), sales partners or agents, independent sales organizations (“ISOs”) and independent software vendors (“ISVs”). These customer channels provide us with multiple routes-to-market. We align our teams, tools and processes around all of our customers to help them grow through reducing their costs, creating efficiencies and generating end-customer demand for business solutions. We enable our customers to create, deliver and manage solutions for end-customers across almost every vertical market in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and the United Kingdom ("UK").
In October 2020 and November 2020, we completed the sale of our product distribution businesses in Europe, the UK, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Peru and our Miami-based export operations (the "Divestitures"). Management determined that the Company did not have sufficient scale in these markets to maximize our value-added model for physical product distribution, leading us to focus and invest in our higher margin businesses. The Divestitures were finalized in the second quarter of the 2021 fiscal year and reported as discontinued operations within this Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated, descriptions of our business and amounts reported in this Form 10-K pertain to continuing operations only. 
Strategy
We rely on a channel sales model to offer hardware, software, services and connectivity from technology suppliers to our sales partners (resellers, agents, ISOs, ISVs) to solve end-customer challenges. With our CASCADE platform, we also offer customers software as a service ("SaaS") and subscription services from leading technology suppliers. While we do not manufacture products, we provide technology solutions and services from leading technology suppliers. Our solutions may include a combination of offerings from multiple suppliers or give our sales partners access to additional services, such as custom configuration, key injection, integration support, custom development and other services. We also offer the flexibility of on-premise, cloud and hybrid solutions.
As a trusted adviser to our sales partners, we provide more complete solutions through a better understanding of end-customer needs. We drive growth through enhancing our sales partners' capabilities to provide hardware, software, services and connectivity solutions. Our teams deliver value-added support programs and services, including education and training, network assessments, implementation, custom development and marketing to help our sales partners extend their capabilities, develop new technology practices or reach new end customers.
Our objective is to grow profitable sales in the technologies we offer and expand in higher margin and adjacent markets to help our sales partners offer more products and services and increase recurring revenue opportunities. As part of our strategic plan, we consider strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance our technology offerings and service capabilities.
Value Proposition
Our customer channels and supplier relationships serve as competitive advantages.

Business Segments
We segment our business into two technology-focused areas that operate in the United States, Canada, Brazil and the UK: 
•Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security; and 
•Worldwide Communications & Services. 
Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security Segment
The Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security portfolio of solutions includes enterprise mobile computing, data capture, barcode printing, POS, payments, networking, electronic physical security, cyber security and other technologies. There are adjacencies among these technologies to develop and deliver solutions for our customers. These solutions include data capture and POS solutions that interface with computer systems to automate the collection, processing and communication of information for commercial and industrial applications, including retail sales, distribution, shipping, inventory control, materials handling, warehouse management and health care applications. Electronic physical security products include identification, access control, video surveillance, intrusion-related and wireless and networking infrastructure products. 
Worldwide Communications & Services Segment
The Worldwide Communications & Services portfolio of solutions includes communications technologies and services for voice, video conferencing, wireless, data networking, cyber security, cable, unified communications and collaboration, cloud and technology services. As these solutions come together on IP networks, new opportunities are created to move into adjacent solutions for all vertical markets, such as education, healthcare and government. This segment includes recurring revenue from our Intelisys and intY businesses.
Customers
Our customers, or sales partners, are businesses of all sizes that sell to end-customers across industries ranging from manufacturing, warehouse and distribution, retail and e-commerce, hospitality, transportation and logistics, government, education and healthcare, among others. Our customers provide us with multiple routes-to-market through various channels, including: VARs, agents, ISOs, and ISVs. No single customer accounted for more than 6% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
VARs
Index to Financial Statements

Within VARs, our customers include specialty technology VARs, direct marketers, IT system integrators, network integrators, service providers, managed service providers and cloud service providers. Specialty technology VARs focus on one or more technologies, providing specialized knowledge and expertise for technology solutions, such as tailored software or integrated hardware. Direct marketers provide a very broad range of technology brands to business, government, education and healthcare markets. IT system integrators and network integrators develop computer and networking solutions for end-customers’ IT needs. Service providers, managed service providers and cloud service providers deliver advanced multi-discipline services with customized solutions that bundle data, collaboration, cloud, network and digital telecommunication services for end-customers' needs. 
Agents
Agents focus on selling telecommunications and cloud services to end-customers, advising about various services, technologies and cost alternatives to help them make informed choices. Agents typically earn monthly commissions on multi-year contract sales as they build their recurring revenue business.
Independent Sales Organizations
ISOs focus on selling credit card processing and finding new merchant customers for credit card member banks. They offer on-going customer service and support and look to bundle hardware, software and processing services. 
Independent Software Vendors
ISVs develop software, apps and integrated solutions. They generally focus on cloud solutions and sell or certify bundled hardware, software and service solutions.
Suppliers
We provide products and services from approximately 500 suppliers, including 8x8, ACC Business, AT&T, Aruba/HPE, AudioCodes, Avaya, Axis, Barco, Bematech, Cisco, Comcast Business, Datalogic, Dell, Elo, Epson, Equinix, Extreme, F5, Five9, Fortinet, Genesys, Hanwha, Honeywell, HID, Ingenico, Intrado, Jabra, LogMeIn, Lumen, March Networks, Masergy, Microsoft, Mitel, NCR, NICE inContact, Oracle, Palo Alto, Panasonic, Poly, RingCentral, Samsung, Sony, Spectralink, Spectrum, Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions, Ubiquiti, Verifone, Verizon, Windstream, Zebra Technologies and Zoom. We also offer customers significant choices in cloud services through our Intelisys business, including "as a service" offerings in contact center, infrastructure and unified communications.
We provide products and services from many of our key suppliers in all of our geographic markets; however, certain suppliers only allow distribution to specific geographies. We typically purchase products directly from the supplier and our supplier agreements generally do not restrict us from selling similar or competitive products or services. We have the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, customer demand or supplier distribution policies.
Products from two suppliers, Cisco and Zebra, each constituted more than 10% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.
•We have three non-exclusive agreements with Cisco. One agreement covers the distribution of Cisco products in the United States and has a two year term. The second agreement covers distribution of products in Brazil and has a two year term. Each of these agreements must be renewed by written agreement. Either party may terminate these agreements upon 30 days' notice to the other party. The third agreement is an agency contract for North America and has a two year term. Either party may terminate this agreement upon 60 days' prior written notice.
•We have three non-exclusive agreements with Zebra. One agreement covers sales of Zebra Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”) products in North America and Brazil, while the other two agreements cover sales of Zebra Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) products in North America and Brazil. The Zebra agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms. Either party may terminate the EVM agreement upon 30 days' notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the AIT agreement for North America upon 60 days’ notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the AIT agreement for Brazil upon 90 days’ notice to the other party. 
In addition to the agreements mentioned above, we have written agreements with almost all of our other suppliers. These agreements generally include the following terms:
Index to Financial Statements

•Non-exclusive distribution rights to resell products and related services in geographical areas (supplier agreements often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which we can sell their products and services).
•Short-term periods, subject to periodic renewal, and provide for termination by either party without cause upon 30 to 120 days' notice.
•Stock rotation rights, which give us the ability, subject to limitations, to return for credit or exchange a portion of the items purchased.
•Price protection provisions, which enables us to take a credit for declines in inventory value resulting from the supplier's price reductions. 
Along with our inventory management policies and practices, these stock rotation rights and price protection provisions are designed to reduce our risk of loss due to slow-moving inventory, supplier price reductions, product updates and obsolescence.
We participate in various rebate, cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by our suppliers to support expenses associated with selling and marketing the suppliers' products and services. These rebates and purchase discounts are largely influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change.
Our suppliers generally warrant their products we sell and allow returns of defective products, including those returned to us by our customers. For certain of our product offerings, we offer a self-branded warranty program. We purchase contracts from unrelated third parties, generally the original equipment manufacturers, to fulfill our obligations to service or replace defective product claimed on these warranty programs. To maintain customer relations, we also facilitate returns of defective products from our customers by accepting for exchange, with our prior approval, most defective products within 30 days of invoicing. In addition, local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the Company.
Offerings and Markets
We currently market over 100,000 products from approximately 500 hardware, software and service suppliers to approximately 30,000 customers. We sell products and services to the United States and Canada from our facilities located in Mississippi, California and Kentucky; into Brazil from facilities located within the Brazilian states of Paraná, Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina. We provide digital products and services from our CASCADE platform. See "Risk Factors," for a discussion of the risks related to our foreign operations. We also have drop-shipment arrangements with some of our suppliers, which allow us to offer products to customers without taking physical delivery at our facilities. These drop-shipment arrangements represent approximately 19% of fiscal year 2021 net sales. 
Our offerings to our customers include hardware, software, services and connectivity across premise, hybrid and cloud environments. With our CASCADE platform, we also offer customers SaaS and subscription services from leading technology suppliers. We believe that sales partners want to offer end-customers complete technology solutions that solve end-user challenges and deliver positive outcomes. We align our teams, tools, and processes to help our sales partners grow by providing more complete solutions through a better understanding of end-customer needs. We are able to provide a combination of offerings from multiple suppliers or give our sales partners access to a number of additional services, including configuration, key injection, integration support and others to deliver solutions. 
We provide our sales partners and suppliers with an array of pre-sale business tools and value-added services, including market and technology solution expertise, education and training, product configuration tools, technical support, logistics and channel financial services. These services allow our sales partners to gain knowledge and experience on marketing, negotiation and selling, to improve customer service, to profitably grow their business and be more cost effective. Our business is enhanced by our ability and willingness to provide the extra level of services that keeps both our sales partners and suppliers satisfied.
We offer technology solutions and services that include the following:
•Mobility and Barcode: We offer automatic identification and data capture (“AIDC”) technology that incorporates the capabilities for electronic identification and data processing without the need for manual input. These solutions consists of a wide range of products that include portable data collection terminals, wireless products, barcode label printers and scanners. As AIDC technology has become more pervasive, applications have evolved from traditional uses, such as inventory control, materials handling, distribution, shipping and warehouse management, to more advanced applications, such as healthcare.

•POS: We provide POS solutions for retail, grocery and hospitality environments to efficiently manage in-store sales and operations. POS solutions include computer-based terminals, tablets, monitors, payment processing solutions, receipt printers, pole displays, cash drawers, keyboards, peripheral equipment and fully integrated processing units. These solutions may include self-service checkout, kiosks and products that attach to the POS network in the store, including network access points, routers and digital signage.
•Payments: We offer payment terminals, comprehensive key injection services, reseller partner branding, extensive key libraries, ability to provide point-to-point encryption (“P2PE”), and redundant key injection facilities. We have the resources to deliver secure payment devices that are preconfigured and ready for use. In addition, we partner with ISVs to deliver to merchants integrated tablet POS solution hardware that a merchant may purchase outright or “as a service,” and which includes merchant hardware support and next-day replacement of tablets, terminals and peripherals.
•Physical Security: We provide electronic physical security solutions that include identification, access control, video surveillance and intrusion-related products and networking infrastructure. Physical security products are used every day across every vertical market to protect lives, property and information. These technology solutions require specialized knowledge to deploy effectively, and we offer in-depth training and education to our sales partners to enable them to maintain the appropriate skill levels.
•Unified Communications and Collaboration: We provide unified communications and collaboration capabilities, such as voice, video, audio conferencing, web conferencing and messaging. These offerings combine voice, data, fax and speech technologies with computers, telecommunications and the internet to deliver communications solutions on-premise, from the cloud and as a hybrid. Software and hardware products include IP-based telephony platforms, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") systems, private branch exchanges (“PBXs”), call center applications, video conferencing, desk phones and other endpoints. Cloud-delivered services, such as unified communications, contact center and video conferencing, enable end-customers to consume and pay for communications services typically on a monthly subscription basis.
•Cloud and Telecom Services: We offer business communications services, including voice, data, access, cable collaboration, wireless and cloud. We focus on empowering and educating sales partners so they can advise end-customers in making informed choices about services, technology and cost savings. With the CASCADE cloud services distribution platform, we offer sales partners another way to grow their recurring revenue practices. CASCADE takes the friction out of acquiring, provisioning and managing SaaS offerings. We have contracts with more than 150 of the world’s leading telecom carriers and cloud services providers.
Human Capital 
General

The strength of our Company is our people, working together to help our customers grow their businesses. As of June 30, 2021, we have approximately 2,200 employees, of which approximately 1,500 are in the United States and 700 are located internationally in Canada, Brazil and the UK. We have no organized labor or trade unions in the United States. We have 12 office locations in the U.S., eight office locations outside of the U.S., and have a remote employee presence. During fiscal year 2021, we added 159 new employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
Respecting and protecting our people and our partners are our highest priorities, from ensuring and supporting an inclusive and diverse workforce and partner base; providing a safe, healthy work environment; and working with suppliers and partners that share this commitment, we do what is right for our employees, channel partners, and end customers. One of our core values is to promote an environment that respects and values the diverse backgrounds, interests, and talents of our employees. In July 2020, we reaffirmed ScanSource’s commitment to diversity and inclusion with the creation of a comprehensive Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) program and the appointment of Ken Peterson as our first Chief Diversity Officer (CDO). Since taking this role, our CDO launched a D&I strategic plan focused on awareness and education, workforce representation, supplier diversity, and community relations. Along with the appointment of the CDO, an internal D&I Advisory Council was created to assist in 
Index to Financial Statements

the implementation of our D&I plan and serve as a sounding board for our employees. Additionally, initiatives including a D&I book and movie club are allowing interested employees to broaden their knowledge on various topics in this space.
Professional Development 
We want to help our employees succeed—both professionally and personally. We focus heavily on the intellectual and professional development of our employees, and we strive to create an immersive working environment for them. To promote personal and professional growth, we also encourage our employees to pursue ongoing training and career development opportunities, and we provide tuition assistance and reimbursement for certain pre-approved continuing education programs and professional certifications. We recently enhanced our learning management system, The Hub, to provide a modernized and engaging user experience for our global employees at all levels of the Intern Class of 2019. The ScanSource Leadership Institute (SLI) is another important program that focuses on identifying and helping to develop the next wave of senior leaders for the Company. The SLI program brings together twelve hand-selected leaders from our global offices for a two-week program of intensive training and development—with organization. While this provides a tool for an individual’s education and growth, it also nurtures cross-functional collaboration with colleagues through a unique social capability.
Benefits
We offer a comprehensive benefits package which includes on average 80% coverage of employee healthcare premiums and several benefits at no cost to our employees, including life insurance, disability insurance, and work-life balance resources. The financial future of our employees is important to us, which is why we have a 401(k) -employer match, performance-based bonus program and employee ownership opportunities for a meaningful portion of our employees through equity incentive grants. We partner with Tuition.io to provide employees access to knowledge and tools to help manage or plan for student loan debt. To expand our financial wellness offerings, we offer workshops and webinars focused on student debt and general debt-counselling services.
Health and Safety 
We care about our employees’ overall well-being and encourage them to have a healthy lifestyle, both physically and mentally. That’s why we offer dedicated resources to help foster a work/life balance. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we swiftly and successfully implemented a work-from-home policy for all employees across geographies, outside of our distribution centers. We have continued this policy and are pleased with how our employees have adjusted to this new way of doing business, maintaining an extremely high level of productivity and performance. With a largely remote workforce, it is critical that we continue to focus on our employees’ health. We continue to build our 360you program, which provides employees with extensive education and training/coaching opportunities, wellness and fitness challenges, screenings, and other valuable resources.
Board Role in Human Capital Management 
Our Board believes that human capital management is an important component of our continued growth and success, and is essential for our ability to attract, retain and develop talented and skilled employees. We pride ourselves on a culture that respects co-workers and values concern for others.
Management regularly reports to the Board on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, employee development and compensation and benefits. Our Board also engages in an active succession planning process. On an annual basis, with the assistance of our CEO, the Board reviews the potential in-house candidates for each of the critical senior management positions and identifies areas of growth for those candidates that will best enable them to fill any need that we might have. Where there is not a satisfactory in-house candidate for a position, the Board considers whether outside candidates are likely to be available in a timely manner and whether other alternatives need to be considered.
Employee Feedback 
We foster opportunities for employee engagement and have multiple avenues for communication which allows all full-time employees to anonymously give us feedback on our workplace culture, employee programs, and more. The Company was also named one of the 2021 Best Places to Work in South Carolina.

Competition
We believe we are a leader in the specialty markets we serve. The market for technology products and solutions is highly competitive, both in the United States and internationally. Competitive factors include price, product availability, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, credit availability, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and breadth of product lines and services, and availability of technical and product information. 
Our competitors include local, regional, national and international distributors, as well as suppliers that sell directly to resellers and to end-customers. In addition, our competitors include master resellers that sell to franchisees, third-party dealers and end-customers. Competition has increased over the last several years as broad line and other value-added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets. Such competition could also result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share.
In our Worldwide Barcode, Networking & Security segment, we compete with broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data in most geographic areas, and more specialized security distributors, such as ADI and Anixter. Additionally, we also compete against other smaller, more specialized AIDC and POS distributors, such as BlueStar. In our Worldwide Communications & Services segment, we compete against broad-line distributors, such as Ingram Micro, Synnex and Tech Data, and more specialized distributors, such as Jenne. Additionally, for Intelisys' technology services, we also compete against other smaller, master agents, such as Avant and Telarus. For our intY business, we compete against other developers of cloud software and services platforms such as CloudBlue and Pax8. As we seek to expand our business into other areas closely related to our offerings, we may encounter increased competition from current competitors and/or from new competitors, some of which may be our current sales partners.
Sales 
Our sales organization consists of inside and field sales representatives located in the United States, Canada, the U.K. and Brazil. The majority of our sales partners are assigned to a dedicated sales representative or team whose main focus is developing customer relationships and providing our sales partners with solutions to meet their end-customer’s needs. Our sales teams are advocates for and trusted advisers to our sales partners. Sales teams are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets, recruiting sales partners, creating demand, negotiating pricing and reviewing overall product and service requirements of our sales partners. Our sales representatives receive comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of suppliers’ products, supplemented by frequent product and service seminars conducted by supplier representatives and bi-weekly meetings among product, marketing and sales managers.
Our sales teams also provide sales partners with online ordering, API, EDI and other information systems, allowing sales partners to easily gain access to product specifications, availability, and customized pricing, as well as the ability to place and follow the status of orders. 
Marketing
We market our technology solutions and services through a range of digital and print channels, including online product catalogs customized for our North American and Brazilian markets; social media; search engine optimization and marketing; content marketing; content automation; e-commerce; email direct marketing, among others. Our marketing practices are tailored to fit the specific needs of our sales partners and suppliers - ensuring we help our partners create, deliver and manage solutions for end-customers across our vertical markets. Our comprehensive marketing efforts include sales promotions, advertisements, management of sales leads, trade show design and event management, advertorials, content creation, partner events, and training and certification courses with leading suppliers in an effort to recruit prospective sales partners. 
Operations
Information Technology Systems
Our information systems are scalable and capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management and accounting. Our sales partners and employees rely on our information systems for online, real-time information on pricing, inventory availability and reservation and order status. Our warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping and automated systems for freight processing and shipment tracking, each of which is integrated with our multiple information systems. The customer service and technical support departments employ systems for documentation and faster processing of sales partner inquiries. To ensure that adequate 
Index to Financial Statements

inventory levels are maintained, our buyers depend on the system’s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a perpetual basis. 
Warehouse and Shipping Strategy
We operate a 741,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, which is located near the FedEx hub facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and primarily serves North America. We also acquired warehouses in California and Kentucky through our POS Portal acquisition. Our principal warehouses for our Brazil operations are located in the Brazilian states of Paraná, Espírito Santo and Santa Catarina. Our objective is to ship all orders on the same day, using technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors. We offer reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize our sales partners' need for inventory.
Financial Services
Our sales terms include trade credit, various third-party financing options, which include leasing, flooring and other secured financing for qualified sales partners. These sales terms allow us to compete within our specific geographic areas to facilitate our growth plans. We believe these options reduce the sales partner’s need to establish multiple credit relationships.
Trade and Service Marks
We conduct our business under the trade names "ScanSource POS and Barcode," "ScanSource Catalyst," "ScanSource Communications," "ScanSource Services," "ScanSource Networking and Security," "ScanSource KBZ," "ScanSource Brasil," "Network1, a ScanSource company," "Intelisys," "POS Portal," "RPM Software, a ScanSource company" and "intY, a ScanSource company." 
Certain of our tradenames, trademarks and service marks are registered, or are in the process of being registered, in the United States or various other countries. We have been issued registrations for many of our marks including, among others, "ScanSource," "Catalyst Telecom," and "Network1" in countries in our principal markets. Even though our marks are not registered in every country where we conduct business, in many cases we have acquired rights in those marks because of our continued use of them. These marks do not have value assigned to them and have a designated indefinite life. We do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our marks. We also sell products and provide services under various third-party tradenames, trademarks and service marks, some of which we reference in this report, and these tradenames, trademarks, and service marks are the property of their respective owners.
