Unless the context indicates otherwise, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” or “us” refer to Sollensys Corp, a Nevada corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Eagle Lake Laboratories, Inc. (“Eagle Lake”) 
 
Overview
 
Our primary product is the Blockchain Archive Server—a turn-key, off-the-shelf, blockchain solution that works with virtually any hardware and software combinations currently used in commerce, without the need to replace or eliminate any part of the client’s data security that is being utilized. The Blockchain Archive Server encrypts, fragments, and distributes data across thousands of secure nodes every day, which makes it virtually impossible for hackers to compromise. Using blockchain technology, the Blockchain Archive Server maintains a redundant, secure, and immutable backup of data. Redundant backups and the blockchain work together to assure not only the physical security of the database but also the integrity of the information held within.
 
Blockchain Archive Server protects client data from “ransomware”—malicious software that infects your computer and displays messages demanding a fee to be paid in order for your system to work again. Blockchain technology is a leading-edge tool for data security, providing an added layer of security against data loss due to all types of software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system (i.e., malware).
 
Uniquely, the Blockchain Archive Server is a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack. The Blockchain Archive Server is a server that comes pre-loaded with the blockchain-powered cybersecurity software, which can be delivered, installed, and integrated into a client’s computer systems with ease.
 
In December 2020, we made our second product offering—the Regional Service Center—available on a limited test market basis. The Regional Service Center was added to our standard product line effective January 1, 2021. A Regional Service Center is a single unit system of 32 Blockchain Archive Servers capable of servicing up to 2,580 individual small accounts, and is marketed to existing IT service providers with established accounts. The Regional Service Center offers small businesses the same state of the art technology previously available only to large or very well-funded companies. Sollensys believes that smaller companies, and even certain individuals, will find the Regional Service Center affordable, paying only for the actual space they use.
 
In connection with the closing of the Stock Purchase, on August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the then-sole member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sollensys, pursuant to the power granted to the Board in Sollensys’ bylaws, increased the size of Sollensys’ Board to two members. Simultaneously, Mr. Lazar, as the sole Board member, appointed Donald Beavers as a director to fill the newly created Board vacancy. At the same time, Mr. Lazar appointed Donald Beavers as Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of Sollensys.
 
Also on August 5, 2020, following the above officer and director appointments and effective on the closing of the Stock Purchase, Mr. Lazar resigned from any and all officer and director positions with Sollensys.
 
Eagle Lake Share Exchange Agreement
 
On November 30, 2020, Sollensys entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Eagle Lake, (ii) each of the shareholders of Eagle Lake (the “Eagle Lake Shareholders”) and (iii) Mr. Beavers as the representative of the Eagle Lake Shareholders. Among other conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA Closing”), pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Sollensys would acquire 100% of Eagle Lake’s issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of a number of shares of Sollensys common stock to be determined at the SEA Closing.

The SEA Closing occurred on November 30, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Sollensys acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders 10,000,000 shares Eagle Lake’s common stock, no par value per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of 95,000,000 shares of Sollensys common stock (the “Share Exchange”). At the time of the SEA Closing, Eagle Lake had 10,011,667 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, which was 11,667 shares in excess of the number of shares of common stock authorized pursuant to Eagle Lake’s articles of incorporation. Such over-issued shares are void under Florida law and are not entitled to any rights of a stockholder of Eagle Lake. As such, the 10,000,000 shares of Eagle Lake common stock that Sollensys acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders, represented 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake of the presence of over-issued shares.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, Eagle Lake became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sollensys and the business of Eagle Lake became the business of Sollensys.
 
Eagle Lake was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 8, 2020. Eagle Lake offers advanced technology products for cybersecurity that ensure a clients’ data integrity through collection, storage, and transmission.

10% Convertible Promissory Note
 
On October 13, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note to AJB Capital Investments, LLC (“AJB”) an unrelated thirty party lender, in the principal amount of $600,000 (“AJB Note”). Pursuant to the terms of the AJB Note, the Company agreed to pay to AJB the principal amount of the AJB Note, together with guaranteed interest on the principal balance in the amount of 10% per calendar year. The AJB Note matured on April 13, 2023 (the “Maturity Date”); provided, however, that the Maturity Date may be extended at the Company’s sole discretion up to six months following the original Maturity Date. If the Maturity Date is extended, the interest rate will be 15% per annum for any period following the original Maturity Date, payable monthly. The AJB Note has an original issue discount of $60,000. Accordingly, the gross proceeds of the AJB Note was $540,000. Any amount of principal or interest on the AJB Note that is not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of the lesser of (i) 18%, and (ii) the maximum amount permitted under law from the due date thereof until the same is paid.
 
3

 

The AJB Note is convertible, subject to a 4.99% equity blocker, in the event of a default, as provided in the AJB Note, into common stock at a conversion price (the “Conversion Price”) equal to the Variable Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) (i) during the previous 10 trading day period ending on the date of issuance of the AJB Note, or (ii) during the previous 10 trading day period ending on the conversion date, whichever is lower. If the common stock is not deliverable electronically by the Depository Trust Company (“DWAC”), an additional 10% discount will apply for all future conversions until DWAC delivery becomes available. If the common stock is “chilled” for deposit into the DTC system and only eligible for clearing deposit, an additional 15% discount will apply for all future conversions until such chill is lifted. Additionally, if the Company ceases to be a reporting company pursuant to the Exchange Act, or if the AJB Note cannot be converted into free trading shares after 181 days from the issue date (other than as a result of AJB’s status as an affiliate of the Company), an additional 15% discount will be attributed to the conversion price.
 
While the AJB Note is outstanding, each time any third party has the right to convert monies owed to that third party into common stock (or receive shares pursuant to a settlement or otherwise), at a discount to market greater than the Conversion Price in effect at that time (prior to all other applicable adjustments in the AJB Note), then AJB, in its sole discretion, may utilize such greater discount percentage (prior to all applicable adjustments in this AJB Note) until the AJB Note is no longer outstanding. While the AJB Note is outstanding, each time any third party has a look back period greater than the look back period in effect under the AJB Note at that time, then AJB, in its sole discretion, may utilize such greater number of look back days until the AJB Note is no longer outstanding.
 
Upon the occurrence of certain events of default specified in the AJB Note, including, but not limited to, a failure to honor a conversion request, failure to maintain the Company’s quotation, or the Company’s failure to comply with its obligations under Exchange Act, all amounts owed to AJB under the AJB Note, including default interest if any, shall then become due and payable. Further, if the Company fail to maintain its quotation, fails to comply with its obligations under the Exchange Act, or loses the “bid” price for its common stock for a period of five days after written notice thereof to the Company, after the nine-month anniversary of the AJB Note, then the principal amount of the AJB Note will increase by $15,000 and AJB will be entitled to use the lowest trading price during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion and the Conversion Price will be redefined to mean 40% multiplied by the Conversion Price, subject to adjustment as provided in the AJB Note.
 
Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the AJB note the Company issued 5,125,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $530,000.
 
Common Stock Purchase Warrant
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, AJB may purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of $0.15, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Warrant, for a period ending on October 13, 2027. Exercises are subject to a 4.99% equity blocker.
 
The Company also agreed to include the shares exercisable upon exercise of the Warrant in a registration statement filed by the Company with respect to a public offering of the Company’s securities. If no such registration statement is filed or if the Company fails to include such shares in the registration statement, then no later than the date that is 90 days after October 13, 2022, the Company will file a registration statement including all shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant and will cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after October 13, 2022.
 
Security Agreement
 
In connection with entry into the SPA and issuance of the AJB Note, on October 13, 2022, the Company entered into a Security Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2022, by and between the Company and AJB (the “Security Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement, the Company agreed to grant to AJB an unconditional and continuing first priority security interest in all of the assets and property of the Company to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of the Company’s obligations under the AJB Note, the SPA and the other documents executed in connection with the SPA.
 
The Security Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations of the Company.

Distribution
 
Sales Structure
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is now available across the United States and Canada through authorized distributors. Currently, Sollensys Corp is the only authorized distributor of the Blockchain Archive Server, pursuant to a Reseller Agreement between Eagle Lake and Sollensys entered into on August 20, 2020 (the “Reseller Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Reseller Agreement, Eagle Lake appointed Sollensys as a non-exclusive distributor of Eagle Lake’s products and services. As a distributor for Eagle Lake, Sollensys has agreed to, among other things, use its best efforts to solicit orders from interested parties for Eagle Lake’s products and services, secure channel partners and distributors for Eagle Lake’s products and services, and to resell Eagle Lake’s products and services to for-profit organizations, non-profit-organizations, government entities, quasi-governmental agencies, and any other type of organizations in the United States and abroad. Sollensys also has the right to engage its own distributors for Eagle Lake’s products. For all sales, Sollensys is entitled to any profits generated on such sales, which is the difference between the cost of Sollensys to acquire the products and/or services from Eagle Lake to sell and the price at which Sollensys is ultimately able to sell those products and/or services to customers.
 
Delivery & Installation
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack. Delivery of the Blockchain Archive Server to a client is accomplished by delivering a server loaded with Eagle Lake’s blockchain cybersecurity software (i.e., the Blockchain Archive Server) to a client’s physical location where such client’s information technology (“IT”) systems infrastructure is accessible. Once physically delivered on-site, the Blockchain Archive Server is installed and integrated with the client’s existing IT system servers. The unit remains at the client’s location to run the software. Sollensys (or its authorized distributors) handles all delivery and installation of the Blockchain Server, and provides maintenance as needed.
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Cyberattacks have evolved from rudimentary malware into highly sophisticated, organized, and large-scale attacks. A broad range of industries are affected by these attacks, consumers to governments, no one is safe.
 
According to a 2019 Year End Report published by RiskBased Security, over 7,000 data breaches were reported in 2019 alone, resulting in over 15 billion records being exposed that show companies have an expanding need to protect themselves from persistent cyber-attacks.
 
Ransomware attacks have generated billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals and inflicted significant damage and expenses for consumers, businesses, and governments. Sophos publish a report in May 2020 titled “The State of Ransomware 2020”. This showed 59% of 500 U.S. organizations surveyed, experienced a ransomware attack, with a global average of 51% of companies having been victims of ransomware attacks in the last year. This report also stated that the average cost to rectify the impacts of a ransomware attack (considering downtime, human resources, device cost, network cost, ransom price, etc.) was $732,520 for organizations that do not pay the ransom. The price tag for organizations that do pay rises to $1,448,458. As of October 1, 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasury warns that paying a ransom my violate U.S. law.
 
An October 2020 article published by Security Magazine reported that data from 25,000 small-to-midsize organizations in the United States reveal ransomware as the top cyber insurance incident in the first half of the year. The average ransomware demand increased 100% from 2019 through the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, 10% of small businesses were put out of business in 2019 due to cyber-attacks according to DarkReading.com.
 
These trends provide significant data demonstrating the need for Sollensys’ Blockchain Archive Server in the cybersecurity market. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the “addressable enterprise security market” benefiting from Sollensys solutions is expected to reach nearly $17.3 billion in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 6.9% through 2024. The “addressable enterprise security market” represents revenue from five markets (web security, security information and event management, network security, corporate endpoint, and data loss protection).

Competition
 
The market for cybersecurity solutions for organizations (i.e., enterprises, governments, etc.) is highly competitive and constantly evolving. Conditions in our market are prone to frequent and rapid changes in technology, customer requirements and preferences, and industry standards resulting in frequent new product and service offerings and improvements and the entrance of new market participants. As a result, we face a broad set of competitors.
 
We compete for cybersecurity budgets both with larger integration providers, such as Symantec (a division of Broadcom), Palo Alto Networks, Sophos, Microsoft, Trend Micro, and Sentinel One in the endpoint, networking, and cloud access security broker (“CASB”) space, as well as with point solutions focusing on a subset of the cybersecurity market. These competitors include Crowdstrike, Carbon Black (a division of Vmware), Tanium, and Cylance (a division of BlackBerry) in the endpoint market, Netskope, and Bitglass in the CASB market, IBM and Cisco in network intrusion, Forcepoint, and Zscaler in the secure web gateways market, and IBM, Splunk, Micro Focus, Dell, and LogRhythm in the security operations market. Products and services differ depending on the organization, but are all considered part of the end user’s cybersecurity budget.
 
The principle competitive factors in the markets for our solutions include:
 

● | brand recognition and reputation;
--+----------------------------------


● | breadth and integration of product offerings; 
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | product features, reliability, performance, and effectiveness; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | price and total cost of ownership; 
--+---------------------------------------


● | strength and productivity of sales and marketing efforts; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | quality of customer service; and 
--+-------------------------------------


● | financial resources and stability. 
--+---------------------------------------


We are not aware of any direct competitors with a product solution similar to the Blockchain Archive Server. Nonetheless, we face competition for budget allocations in all of the areas outlined above. We believe we compete favorably in a number of the above factors; however, we believe that our primary competitive advantage is the compatibility and ease of installation of our Blockchain Archive Server, which was designed as a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack.
 
However, many of our current competitors and potential competitors have competitive advantages, such as more extensive operations, larger product development and strategic acquisition budgets, or greater financial, technical, sales, or marketing resources than we do. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Customers, Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products or services directly to customers. In addition, in the future, we may contract with third party distributors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to sell our products and services.
 
We have sold the Blockchain Archive Server to a number of different companies in a wide array of industries. Companies that have purchased the Blockchain Archive Server include SFTF, LLC, which operates five Ashley HomeStore Outlets in Jacksonville, Florida. Ashley HomeStore is the number one furniture and mattress retailer in America and the number one selling furniture store brand in the world. In addition, the Blockchain Archive Server has been purchased and installed for medical data protection at Ability Plus Therapy Inc., which operates a pediatric therapy center in Melbourne, Florida and at Island Direct Primary Care, a concierge medical service in Merritt Island, Florida. Both firms provide private health care and wellness services to individuals or companies. At these locations, a special version of the Blockchain Archive Server designed to meet the unique requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) regarding patient/doctor confidentiality was delivered to these customers.
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is available across the United States and Canada. To date, most customers have been small-to-medium sized businesses. We are dependent on any of these individual customers.

Suppliers and Raw Materials
 
We purchase the servers used to make the Blockchain Archive Servers from third-party retailers, such as Amazon. We have not entered into any agreements with suppliers for any hardware or other raw materials.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to compliance with a number of regulations, in the United States and internationally, in connection with the operation of our business. By virtue of the fact that our Blockchain Archive Server involves processing of personal information, we are subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations, which are evolving and being tested in courts, which may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.
 
A variety of data protection legislation apply in the U.S. at both the federal and state level, including new laws that may impact our operations. For example, in 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with enforcement by the state attorney general beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA defines “personal information” in a broad manner and generally requires companies that process personal information of California residents to make new disclosures about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt-out of certain data sharing with third parties or sale of personal information, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches.
 
In 2016, the European Union (the “E.U.”) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took effect in 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to existing E.U. law), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Similarly, there are a number of federal and state level legislative proposals in the U.S. that could impose new obligations on us. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing more onerous data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or other requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Although our sales are currently focused on customers in the U.S. and Canada, we may expand into Europe in the future, and would then be subject to such laws.
 
Like other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products may be subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the U.S. with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.

Corporate History
 
Sollensys Corp was formerly a development stage company, incorporated in Nevada on September 29, 2010, under the name Health Directory, Inc. The Company’s initial plans included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, and capital formation. A substantial portion of the Company’s efforts involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace. The Company did not, however, generate any revenues from these efforts.
 
Effective July 30, 2012, the holder of 3,000,000 shares, or approximately 79.8% of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities, executed a written consent approving an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Sollensys Corp, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 1,500,000,000, increase the number of authorized preferred shares to 25,000,000, and to split each outstanding share of common stock into 131.69 shares of common stock.
 
Subsequently, beginning September 30, 2012, the Company went dormant.
 
On December 27, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”), pursuant to Case number A-19-805633-B appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC (“Custodian Ventures”) as the custodian of Sollensys Corp David Lazar, who controls Custodian Ventures, was subsequently named the only interim officer and director of the Company.
 
On June 16, 2020, Custodian Ventures filed a motion with the Court asking the Court to enter an order concluding and terminating the custodianship of the Company. On July 20, 2020, the Court entered an order terminating custodianship and barring non-asserted claims against the Company.
 
Effective August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the interim Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and sole director of the Company and the beneficial owner, through his ownership of Custodian Ventures of 19,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, representing 100% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) by and among Eagle Lake, Sollensys Corp, and Custodian Ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, Eagle Lake agreed to purchase, and Custodian Ventures agreed to sell, 19,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A preferred stock in exchange for payment by Eagle Lake to Custodian Ventures of $230,000 (collectively with the other transactions in the SPA, the “Stock Purchase”). The Stock Purchase closed on August 5, 2020. The shares of Series A preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 50 shares of common stock per share of Series A preferred stock, and has voting power on an as-converted basis (voting with the common stock as one class), and thus represents 65.4% of the voting power of all shares of stock of the Company.

In connection with the closing of the Stock Purchase, on August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the then-sole member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company, pursuant to the power granted to the Board in the Company’s bylaws, increased the size of the Company’s Board to two members. Simultaneously, Mr. Lazar, as the sole Board member, appointed Donald Beavers as a director to fill the newly created Board vacancy. At the same time, Mr. Lazar appointed Mr. Beavers as Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company.
 
Also on August 5, 2020, following Mr. Beaver’s appointment and effective on the closing of the Stock Purchase, Mr. Lazar resigned from any and all officer and director positions with the Company. Mr. Lazar’s resignation was not the result of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices.
 
On November 30, 2020, Sollensys Corp entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Eagle Lake, (ii) each of the shareholders of Eagle Lake (the “Eagle Lake Shareholders”) and (iii) Mr. Beavers as the representative of the Eagle Lake Shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”).
 
Among other conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA Closing”), pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Sollensys Corp would acquire 100% of Eagle Lake’s issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of a number of shares of Sollensys Corp’s common stock to be determined at the SEA Closing.
 
The SEA Closing occurred on November 30, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Sollensys Corp acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders 10,000,000 shares Eagle Lake’s common stock, no par value per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of 95,000,000 shares of Sollensys common stock (the “Share Exchange”). At the time of the SEA Closing, Eagle Lake had 10,011,667 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, which was 11,667 shares in excess of the number of shares of common stock authorized pursuant to Eagle Lake’s articles of incorporation. Such over-issued shares are void under Florida law and are not entitled to any rights of a stockholder of Eagle Lake. As such, the 10,000,000 shares of Eagle Lake common stock that Sollensys Corp acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders, represented 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake of the presence of over-issued shares.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, Eagle Lake became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sollensys Corp and the business of Eagle Lake became the business of Sollensys Corp.
 
The Share Exchange is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Share Exchange Agreement is intended to be a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes.
