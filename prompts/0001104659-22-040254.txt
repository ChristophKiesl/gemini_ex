Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a newly-organized, blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, which we refer to throughout this annual report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this annual report on Form 10-K as a target business. Our sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Production Board (“TPB”), a holding company of businesses established to solve fundamental problems that affect our planet, by reimagining systems of production in agriculture, food, biomanufacturing, human health and life sciences. Through our sponsor, TPB provides us with unique expertise in identifying high-potential businesses, attracting key talent, and differentiated access to a deep network of investors and entrepreneurs worldwide. As described further below, we currently intend to consummate our initial business combination with an independent company in the sectors we operate, either as a standalone transaction or by combining with an independent company and TPB or one or more existing portfolio companies of TPB. We will not however complete an initial business combination with only TPB or a portfolio company of TPB.
We plan to pursue business combination opportunities with sustainability-focused companies across the food, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and life sciences sectors. We initially intend to focus our search on target businesses that are radically transformative within their industry, applying differentiated technology to reimagine outdated systems of production while offering compelling value to customers and shareholders, though we reserve the right to pursue an opportunity in any industry or sector.
We currently intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business across several related disciplines within our target industries, as well as on the reputation, significant experience and relationships of our management team to complete an initial business combination. The executives that comprise our management team are recognized leaders in building, operating, and investing in science-led businesses that seek to solve fundamental problems affecting our planet. They have a track record generating significant value creation at prominent companies across the hardware, software, food, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and life sciences sectors. In addition, our management team, through long-standing industry relationships, has global access to the operating, venture capital and financial sponsor communities, providing a key avenue to a pipeline of potential target acquisition opportunities.
Our Sponsor
Our sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Production Board and benefits from the operational expertise of TPB. Founded by David Friedberg, TPB is a holding company of businesses established to solve the most fundamental problems that affect our planet, by reimagining systems of production in agriculture, food, biomanufacturing, human health and life sciences. TPB operates as a permanent capital holding company, which affords it the flexibility to deploy capital in science-led businesses that TPB believes can have outsized returns with a long time horizon.

TPB takes a system-level, science-led approach to solving fundamental problems that affect the planet and its inhabitants. TPB does this by building disruptive and innovative businesses from the ground up, starting with significant research into breakthrough science and engineering. By combining these technical insights with an understanding of the global market dynamics surrounding food, agriculture, biomanufacturing and life sciences, TPB is able to define business theses that strive to deliver customers more for less, reduce the environmental footprint of the production systems utilized, and create significant value for shareholders. TPB also actively invests in existing businesses that map to these defined theses.
The Production Board’s Capabilities
Our sponsor is wholly-owned and operated by The Production Board. In addition, several members of our management and our sponsor’s management, including David Friedberg (our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of our sponsor), are on the management team of The Production Board, such that we expect to benefit from the proven track-record of business creation and unique capabilities of TPB. While TPB is not obligated to provide us any services or support with respect to sourcing, evaluating and consummating an initial business combination with potential targets, it has financial incentives to do so as the beneficial owner of our founder shares. We benefit from the following capabilities of TPB:

1. | Sourcing and Scientific Collaboration: TPB conducts deep scientific and technical research with scientists, academics and engineers, working across physics, biology, biochemistry, genomics, medicine, hardware and software engineering, with a goal of identifying emerging discoveries relevant to the markets we operate in, including food, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and life sciences. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Unique Theses: TPB aims to define problem-solution theses that it believes could positively impact these markets and enable substantial business value creation. TPB has significant experience developing and testing product and technology prototypes; defining feasibility metrics, timelines, and financial models, and conducting deep market mapping of existing businesses that might map to its theses. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Markets and Networks: TPB develops and maintains deep relationships with companies, executives, analysts, and investors across the markets in which it operates. These relationships help our sponsor identify technical, economic, and marketplace transitions that create opportunities for systemic evolution. These relationships also help our sponsor identify specific businesses that fit an existing thesis and may provide direct access to the management teams and Boards of those businesses. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Executive Leadership and Teambuilding: TPB organizes multi-disciplinary mission-aligned leadership teams to build new businesses and provides active leadership team recruiting and development for existing businesses. TPB has developed a network of experienced executives that may enhance leadership teams and offers in-house executive recruiting and leadership development to its companies. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Growth and Commercial Support: TPB is an active strategic partner to the businesses it invests in, providing strategic guidance, commercial partnership development, recruiting, and operating support. TPB’s network of business and financial relationships enhance commercial access, accelerate growth, and support scale. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Though we benefit from TPB’s capabilities, none of TPB’s businesses are a direct source of returns for our shareholders (other than to the extent such TPB business is a part of the initial business combination), including investors in our initial offering. TPB is not obligated to provide us any services or support with respect to sourcing, evaluating and consummating an initial business combination with potential targets. TPB does not receive any compensation or economic benefit from contributing its capabilities to us except the extent (1) we consummate our initial business combination with an independent company and TPB or one or more existing portfolio companies of TPB and TPB benefits from such business combination and (2) TPB benefits from its indirect beneficial ownership of our founder shares, which is derived from its ownership and control of our sponsor.
Our Management Team
Our management team consists of highly-experienced industry executives with proven track records.

Our Forward Purchase Agreements
We believe our ability to complete our initial business combination is enhanced by our forward purchase agreements. The forward purchases provide us with appropriate funding for our initial business combination.
Prior to our initial offering, we entered into the sponsor forward purchase agreement, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,500,000 forward purchase units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of up to $25,000,000. The purchase of the forward purchase units is expected to take place concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Our sponsor’s obligation to purchase the forward purchase units may be transferred, in whole or in part, to forward transferees who are investors in, or affiliates of, our sponsor, provided that upon such transfer the forward transferees assume the rights and obligations of our sponsor.

4



We also have entered into additional forward purchase agreements whereby the additional forward purchasers have agreed to purchase approximately 8,750,000 Class A ordinary shares, at a price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $87,500,000 in connection with the closing of our initial business combination. Forward purchase shares will be allocated among the additional forward purchasers pro rata based on such investors’ participation in our initial offering relative to all of the anchor investors. For example, if an anchor investor purchased 10% of the aggregate number of Class A ordinary shares purchased by all anchor investor in our initial offering, such investor would be entitled to purchase up to 875,000 forward purchase shares, which represents approximately 10% of the total number of forward purchase shares available for purchase. Pursuant to the terms of the additional forward purchase agreements, we will provide to the additional forward purchasers notice of our intent to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination (however, such additional forward purchasers will not be entitled to partake in negotiations with any prospective target), and thereafter the additional forward purchasers will have 10 business days to provide their respective funding commitments, including the ability to oversubscribe for any unallocated additional forward purchase shares. The additional forward purchasers may satisfy their funding commitments with respect to a number of additional forward purchase shares by (i) committing to purchase some or all of the additional forward purchase shares allocated to such additional forward purchaser, (ii) executing a non-redemption agreement with respect to an equal number public shares held by it (on a share-for-share basis such that the agreement not to redeem one Class A ordinary share shall be deemed to satisfy a commitment to purchase one additional forward purchase share), or (iii) a combination of the foregoing. The additional forward purchasers’ obligation to purchase the additional forward purchase shares may be transferred, in whole or in part, to forward transferees, provided that upon such transfer the forward transferees assume the rights and obligations of the additional forward purchaser. Any purchases of the additional forward purchase shares are expected to take place concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the additional forward purchase agreements, our sponsor has agreed to transfer up to 50% (not to exceed 2,187,500 Class B ordinary shares), but not less than 10% (not to exceed 437,500 Class B ordinary shares), of the Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of the closing of our initial offering to fully subscribing additional forward purchasers. The number of Class B ordinary shares to be transferred to such additional forward purchasers will be equal to the greater of (i) 10% of the Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of the closing of our initial offering (not to exceed 437,500 Class B ordinary shares) and (b) 50% of the Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of the closing of our initial offering (not to exceed 2,187,500 Class B ordinary shares) multiplied by the percentage of public shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has agreed that the remaining Class B ordinary shares held by it will be subject to price-based vesting conditions. Such shares will vest in three equal installments when the price of our Class A ordinary shares on Nasdaq equals or exceeds $10.00, $12.50 and $15.00 for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading-day period, commencing on the date of the closing of our initial business combination and ending on the third anniversary thereof. Our sponsor will forfeit any remaining founder shares for no consideration to the extent the trading price thresholds described above are not met during the specified period.
Assuming that each anchor investor fully subscribes for its allocation of forward purchase shares pursuant to the additional forward purchase agreements, the anchor investors would own, in the aggregate, up to 10,937,500 Class A ordinary shares following the closing of the business combination, which includes up to 2,187,500 Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares transferred to them pursuant to the terms of the additional forward purchase agreements, but does not include any Class A ordinary shares purchased by the anchor investors in our initial offering or in the open market.
In addition, if our sponsor fully subscribes for 2,500,000 forward purchase units pursuant to the sponsor forward purchase agreement, it would own 4,687,500 Class A ordinary shares (or 5,343,750 Class A ordinary shares if the underwrites’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) upon conversion of the 2,187,500 Class B ordinary shares (or 2,843,750 Class B ordinary shares if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) that it holds after the transfer of 2,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, in the aggregate, to the anchor investors. The potential combined holding of our sponsor and the anchor investors is substantial and could result in our public shareholders owning a smaller percentage of the combined company resulting from our initial business combination than public shareholders of other special purpose acquisition companies after their initial business combinations. To the extent our sponsor subscribes for forward purchase units and does not transfer an equal or greater number of Class B ordinary shares to the anchor investors pursuant to the additional forward purchase agreements, it could own significantly greater than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination.
The proceeds of all purchases made pursuant to the forward purchase agreements will not be deposited into our operating account.

5



The terms of the forward purchase units, forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants are expected to generally be identical to the terms of the units, the Class A ordinary shares and public warrants, respectively, being issued in our initial offering, except that the forward purchase units and additional forward purchase shares will have no redemption rights and will have no right to liquidating distributions from our trust account. In addition, as long as the forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants are held by our sponsor, the additional forward purchasers or the forward transferees, they will be subject to certain registration rights. The sponsor will, and we understand that the additional forward purchasers will, acquire the forward purchase units and the additional forward purchase shares, as applicable, with the investment intent to hold such forward purchase securities.
If our sponsor and the additional forward purchasers do not exercise their rights to purchase forward purchase units and additional forward purchase shares, as applicable, it may be significantly more difficult to secure capital to complete our initial business combination on favorable terms or at all.
Market Opportunity
We plan to pursue business combination opportunities with sustainability-focused companies that operate across the food, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and life sciences sectors. We expect to leverage TPB’s technical insights, operational experience, and broad business network to identify and close a business combination that creates shareholder value.
We believe that few of our current systems of production drive meaningful efficiency gains or use the best possible technology available. Inefficient industrialization has had significantly deleterious effects on our planet.

● | Climate Change: The cumulative impact of fossil-fuel based technologies has led to an increasingly dramatic impact on the environment. The annual natural disaster rate is up 3.5 times since 1900 and the last five years were the hottest ever recorded. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Food Security and Loss of Arable Land: The amount of land available for agriculture is declining rapidly, straining our ability to feed a growing global population. Each year, 24 billion tons of fertile soil are being lost, largely due to unsustainable agriculture practices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Declining Ecosystem: Industrialization and climate change has had a devastating effect on biodiversity. The extinction rate of species has increased by 2.5 times since 1900, causing approximately $577 billion of global crops at risk from pollinator loss. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Human Health: A focus on maximizing the quantity and profit extraction of food production has led to a drastic decline in the nutritional quality of food today. Cheap calories have led to approximately 40% of the American adult population being overweight, while lack of nutrient availability has left 11% of the global population undernourished. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe today that it is possible to transform our systems of production using chemical, biological, biochemical, hardware, and software-based tools available to us. Transforming these systems could enable significant improvements in the efficiency, cost, and environmental footprint of human consumption. There are several sectors where we have theses around how new technology tools present significant sustainability-focused business opportunities. These include, but are not limited to:

● | Food and Agriculture
--+---------------------


● | Transitioning from traditional crop species to alternative crops with new genetics that increase yields and nutritional density, while reducing inputs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biological alternatives to traditional crop inputs such as fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides and fungicides that increase yields, reduce costs, while reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture production.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient software-driven, decision-making support tools for crop producers that increase yields and reduce costs and the environmental footprint of agriculture production.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Biomanufacturing
--+-----------------


● | Transitioning from current production systems for proteins and materials, which are costly, timely and resource intensive, to ones that are distributed and based on biomanufacturing through fermentation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producing animal proteins without animals using fermentation systems, which would reduce fertilizer, land use, time, cost and the environmental footprint of animal protein production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Life Sciences
--+--------------


● | Human microbiome alternation and engineering as a means of delivering nutritional and health outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Novel engineered proteins that deliver novel health outcomes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Novel tools to enhance protein and microorganism design, engineering, and production with application ranging from human health to food to industrial applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Strategy
Our objective is to acquire a target that has the potential to meaningfully accelerate the adoption of scalable solutions for some of the biggest problems that humankind faces. We may do this by acquiring a stand-alone company that has the attributes we value and that, when combined with capital, can accelerate its path to success. We may also choose to combine with a target business as well as TPB or one or more TPB portfolio companies that can meaningfully accelerate the adoption of its solutions or scale of its business. See “Our Initial Business Combination Process and Possible Combination with TPB or a Portfolio Company of TPB” below.
We believe many businesses across the food, agriculture, biomanufacturing and life sciences sectors could benefit from access to the public markets, but have thus far been unable to access these markets due to a number of factors, including standalone lack of scale, value creation using technology, and perceived commercialization risk. We expect to utilize our management team’s experience in operating and leading successful companies and significant relationships in these sectors to achieve our objective. Our selection process will leverage our management team’s deep and trusted networks across the food, agriculture, biomanufacturing, and life sciences sectors, which we believe will provide us with access to attractive business combination opportunities in these sectors.
Acquisition Criteria
We intend to identify companies that have compelling growth potential and a combination of the characteristics listed below. We will use these guidelines to evaluate acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria.
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are critical to evaluating prospective companies within our targeted sectors:

● | Where we can materially impact the value of the company in partnership with management: We will seek to acquire a business where we expect TPB’s capabilities can be leveraged to improve the operations, financial performance and market position of the target. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have a defensible market position: We will seek to acquire a business that has a defensible position within a target market because of its differentiated technology, economies of scale, brand strength, distribution capabilities, vertical integration or other competitive advantages. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Close to our networks of operators, investors and advisors: We will aim to leverage TPB’s networks and differentiated access to our target sectors to source our business combination. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have an attractive financial profile: We will seek to acquire a business that has attractive product margins and a strong cash flow profile. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7




● | Have opportunities for growth: We will seek to acquire a business that has opportunities to grow through the application of technology or scaling-up, with limited market risk. We will focus on companies that have the potential to grow organically or through add-on acquisitions, and where future capital raises may not be necessary. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Would benefit from access to the public markets: We will seek to acquire a business that would benefit from better access to capital, an expansion of its investor base, or other benefits of becoming a public company. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.
Our Initial Business Combination Process and Possible Combination with TPB or a Portfolio Company of TPB
Concurrently with our initial business combination, we may combine with TPB or one or more portfolio companies of TPB. The resulting combined company would inherit our Nasdaq listing and its ordinary shares and warrants would be publicly traded. We believe the combination of our entity with an independent target of our choosing across the food, agriculture, biomanufacturing and life sciences sectors, and potentially TPB or a portfolio company of TPB, will allow the resulting combined company to leverage TPB’s existing experienced management team and geographic footprint and offer significant synergy and long-term value creation opportunities for our investors and serve as a platform for further growth.
Even though we currently intend to consummate our initial business combination with an independent company in the sectors TPB operates, either as a standalone transaction or by combining with an independent company and TPB or one or more existing portfolio companies of TPB, we cannot provide any assurance that such a merger with TPB or a portfolio company of TPB will occur at all, or, if it does, we cannot provide any assurance as to the terms thereof. In addition, we will likely not consummate a merger with TPB or a portfolio company of TPB if the target business with respect to our initial business combination is not within the intersection of food, agriculture, biomanufacturing and life sciences, or adjacent industries. If we pursue a combination with TPB, or a portfolio company of TPB, concurrently with our initial business combination, a committee of our disinterested directors will negotiate the terms and conditions of such merger (including the valuation of the portfolio company of TPB) on our behalf. Such committee of disinterested directors would also obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the proposed merger with the portfolio company is fair to our company and our shareholders from a financial point of view. Our public shareholders will have the same voting and redemption rights with respect to any merger with TPB or a portfolio company of TPB as are applicable to our initial business combination and described elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K .
In evaluating a prospective target business for our initial business combination, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with TPB, our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates. Similar to our approach with respect to a potential merger with TPB or a portfolio company of TPB, in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with TPB, our sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their affiliates, we, or a committee of disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member or FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.

Members of our management team will directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to our initial business combination.
In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and may determine to only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our shareholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided to any such officers and directors. We do not have any plan for any waiver of the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors’ post-business combination.
Further, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business or businesses in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target business and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. Subject to the foregoing, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations, or with TPB, or a portfolio company of TPB, alone. If we combine with TPB, or a portfolio company of TPB, concurrently with our initial business combination, we will not include the fair market value of TPB for purposes of satisfying the 80% of net assets test.
We will filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter.
