 Developments in our Company's business during the July 31, 2021 fiscal year covered by this report include the following:
 On August 19, 2019, the Company completed the second tranche of a non-brokered private placement for a total of $2,412,281 (C$3,207,850) through the sale of 4,582,644 units at a price of $0.53 (C$0.70) per unit where each unit consists of one share of common stock and one-half of one share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant is exercisable into one share of common stock at a price of $0.80 (C$1.00) until August 19, 2022. The Company has paid finders' fees and associated legal fees of $8,710 and issued a total of 11,196 finder's warrants with a value of $4,990 entitling the holder to acquire one share at a price of $0.80 (C$1.00) until August 19, 2022. The following weighted average assumptions were used for the Black-Scholes pricing model valuation of these warrants: Risk-free interest rate - 1.52%; expected volatility - 123.27%; share price of C$0.85 and strike price - C$1.00; expected life of warrants - 3 years.
 .
 On September 3, 2019, the Company completed a debt financing with Eridanus Capital LLC (the "Lender") for $1,000,000 (the "Loan"). The Loan has a term of 4 years and an annual interest rate of 10% for the first two years increasing to 20% in year 3 and to 25% in year 4. Interest will accrue and be paid along with the principal upon the maturity date. The Lender received 1,150,000 bonus share purchase warrants as additional consideration for advancing the Loan. The fair value of these warrants was calculated to be $444,942 which was netted against the loan payable balance along with $15,000 paid to the lender for a total of $459,942 in other issuance costs. Each warrant entitles the holder to acquire one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.80 (C$1.00) for a period of three years from the date of issuance. The Loan may be repaid prior to the maturity date, in whole or in part, provided that all accrued interest is paid. In addition, if total interest payments are less than $200,000, the difference will be paid to the Lender as prepayment compensation. The Loan is secured against the assets of the Company and its subsidiary and will be used for permitting, engineering and working capital at the Company's Idaho Maryland Gold Project.

Our plan of operations for the next 12 months is to continue the Use Permit process in Nevada County California, to re-open the Idaho-Maryland gold mine at the I-M Mine Property.
 The Company submitted the application for a Use Permit to Nevada County on November 21, 2019. On April 28th, 2020, with a vote of 5-0, the Nevada County ("County") Board of Supervisors approved the contract for Raney Planning & Management Inc. ("Raney") to prepare the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and conduct contract planning services on behalf of the County for the proposed Idaho-Maryland Mine Project. Raney has been working since that time on review of the technical studies submitted by Rise with the Use Permit application and preparing the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR"). A general outline of remaining milestones in the process to approval of the permit is outlined as follows;
 1) County planning staff and Raney prepare a Draft EIR
 2) Draft EIR is published for public comment;
 3) Raney publishes a Final EIR which includes responses to public comments on the Draft EIR; and
 4) County decision makers review the Final EIR, certify the environmental document and consider approval of the Use Permit and Reclamation Plan at a public hearing.
 The Company's estimate of the remaining timeline to approval is approximately early 2022. Ancillary construction and operational permits would follow as needed. 
 Project Design
 The Use Permit application proposes underground mining to recommence at an average throughput of 1,000 tons per day. The existing Brunswick Shaft, which extends to ~3400 feet depth below surface, would be used as the primary rock conveyance from the I-M Mine Property. A second service shaft would be constructed by raising from underground to provide for the conveyance of personnel, materials, and equipment. Gold processing would be done by gravity and flotation to produce gravity and flotation gold concentrates. Processing equipment and operations would be fully enclosed in attractive modern buildings and numerous mature trees located on the perimeter of the Brunswick site would be retained to provide visual shielding of aboveground project facilities and operations.
 The Company would produce barren rock from underground tunnelling and sand tailings as part of the project which would be used for creation of approximately 58 acres of level and useable industrial zoned land for future economic development in Nevada County.
 A water treatment plant and pond, using conventional processes, would ensure that groundwater pumped from the mine is treated to regulatory standards before being discharged to the local waterways.
 Detailed studies by professionals in the fields of civil and electrical engineering, biology, hydrology, cultural resources, traffic, air quality, human health, vibration, and sound have guided the design of the project.
 Approximately 300 employees would be required if the mine reaches full production.
 Employees
 The Company has one full-time employee, which is the Chief Executive Officer. Our other officers and directors provide services to us on an as-needed basis, and we plan to rely on their efforts, as well as those of a number of independent consultants, to manage our operations for the foreseeable future.

Government Regulations
 We plan to engage in mineral exploration and development activities and will accordingly be exposed to environmental risks associated with mineral exploration activity. We are the operator of the I-M Mine Property.
 Our exploration and development activities will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and permits governing protection of the environment. Among other things, its operations must comply with the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 as administered by the United States Department of Labor.
 Our plan is to conduct our operations in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material respects.
 The costs associated with implementing and complying with environmental requirements can be substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in developing or conducting operations on its properties, including the I-M Mine Property, the extent of which cannot be predicted with any certainty.
