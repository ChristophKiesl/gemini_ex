Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We were formerly a Nevada corporation based out of Orlando, Florida. We intended to participate in cutting edge development and import and sell state of the art 3D printers, scanners, and ancillary equipment. Our mission was to provide individual and corporate customers with the most advanced and reliable cutting edge 3D printing technology in the most cost effective packages available in the marketplace at whatever level is appropriate for their needs. We want our business to be the “go to” vendor of 3D printers for individuals and businesses. Our focus was on the development of powderless metal and medical printers and printing technology.
 
The 3D printing industry is in its very early stages but is already getting more press and generating more excitement than almost any other technological development of recent years. It is not often that a new idea is constantly described as moving the goalposts for the way we actually live our lives. Amidst all the press and the hype, the reality of what the technology is capable of and the speed of its improvement is breathtaking.
 
We were committed to supplying the best plastic, medical, culinary, and powderless metal 3D printers in the industry, and we are supplied by one of the largest and most experienced 3D printing research, development, and manufacturing entities in the world. 3D MakerJet’s research and development partner and manufacturer, ZBOT / Guangzhou DNSPOWER Design Co. LTD, was founded in 2000, and is a leader in the 3D printing industry. A cutting-edge developer in the manufacturing sector, ZBOT won the coveted CDA National Design Award for its ZBOT 3D Printer, which is the platform of the 3D MakerJet printer line, making their 3D printer the only CDA winner at the Civilian level, reflecting the product’s superior quality, as well as the manufacturer’s comprehensive strength, commitment, and capabilities.
