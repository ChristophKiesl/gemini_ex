ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Vivint Smart Home is a leading smart home platform company serving approximately 1.7 million subscribers as of December 31, 2020. Our mission is to redefine the home experience through intelligently designed cloud-enabled solutions, delivered to every home by people who care. Our brand name, Vivint, represents “to live intelligently,” and our solutions help our subscribers do just that.
We make creating a smart home easy and affordable with an integrated platform, best-in-class products, hassle-free professional installation and zero percent interest rate consumer financing for most customers. We help consumers create a customized solution for their home by integrating smart cameras (indoor, outdoor, doorbell), locks, lights, thermostats, garage door control, car protection and a host of safety and security sensors. As of December 31, 2020, on average our subscribers had 15 security and smart home devices in each home. 
We provide a fully integrated solution for consumers with our vertically integrated business model which includes hardware, software, sales, installation, support and professional monitoring. This model strengthens our ability to deliver superior experiences at every customer touchpoint and a complete end-to-end smart home experience. This seamless integration of high-quality products and services results in an average subscriber lifetime of approximately eight years, as of December 31, 2020.
Our cloud-based home platform currently manages more than 23 million in-home devices as of December 31, 2020. Our subscribers are able to interact with their connected home by using their voice or mobile device—anytime, anywhere. They can engage with people at their front door; view live and recorded video inside and outside their home; control thermostats, locks, lights, and garage doors; and proactively manage the comings and goings of family, friends and visitors. Our average subscriber engages with our smart home app multiple times per day.
Our technology and people are the foundation of our business. Our trained professionals educate consumers on the value and affordability of a smart home, design a customized solution for their homes and their individual needs, teach them how to use our platform to enhance their experience, and provide ongoing tech-enabled services to manage, monitor and secure their home. 
Our Smart Home as a Service (“SHaaS”) business model generates subscription-based, high-margin recurring revenue from subscribers who sign up for our smart home services. More than 95% of our revenue is recurring, which provides long-term visibility and predictability to our business. Despite the many uncertainties pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, our recurring revenue model has proven resilient.
General Developments
Prior to the Merger, we were a blank check company. On January 17, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), Vivint Smart Home and Legacy Vivint Smart Home, consummated the Merger. 
In connection with the Closing, Mosaic Acquisition Corp. changed its name to Vivint Smart Home, Inc.
Our Industry
The smart home market is an expanding global opportunity and in the very early stages of broad consumer adoption. The connected home has a multitude of devices and requires a platform to coordinate them all within a single unified system. Integrating smart home devices from different manufacturers that were not designed to work together is difficult, and often results in an experience that is complex, inconsistent and unreliable. Moreover, do-it-yourself ("DIY") solutions put a large burden on homeowners to install and support many devices themselves. Some DIY solutions also require a high upfront cost, which can be prohibitively expensive for certain customers, limiting their potential for mass adoption.
Just as developers of smart phone operating systems enabled entirely new kinds of applications and use cases for their mobile devices, we believe that our smart home operating system provides the foundation for the full smart home experience. 
Table of Contents

We believe there is a significant opportunity for companies to provide an end-to-end smart home experience. A successful smart home company must be able to provide the following:
•An end-to-end solution with a comprehensive integration of technology and people;
•A cloud-enabled operating system that provides a seamless and intuitive smart home experience;
•A portfolio of compelling use cases orchestrated across multiple devices and leveraging artificial intelligence for adaptive and personalized automation;
•A broad suite of smart devices designed to work as part of a comprehensive smart home;
•An extensible platform complete with deep partner integrations of popular stand-alone devices;
•Local professional services to educate consumers and to install and support devices in every home; and
•A trusted relationship with consumers who expect their sensitive home data to be kept private.
We believe our fully integrated solution that provides end-to-end product, sales and service throughout the life of the customer successfully addresses all these key points of friction and positions us to drive broad consumer market adoption.
Our Smart Home Platform 
We pioneered a comprehensive smart home platform and began installing connected home solutions in 2010. Our cloud-enabled smart home operating system delivers on the promise of a true smart home experience. 
Some key benefits of our platform include:
Integrated smart home experiences. We have developed and launched over 10 proprietary devices since 2010, all designed to seamlessly integrate into a comprehensive smart home solution. The software inside these devices, in combination with our cloud-based software and mobile apps, comprises the smart home operating system that knits these elements together to intuitively enable otherwise complex use cases that help address real-world problems. For instance, when someone comes to the front door, the homeowner may want to let them into the house. This requires a doorbell camera, lighting, locks, the security system, and indoor cameras to all work seamlessly together. Our smart home operating system does just this, enabling a multitude of use cases in a simple and intuitive fashion. 
Anywhere, anytime access. Our operating system securely manages real-time communications and allows users to interact with their homes from around the globe. In addition to in-home touchscreens and our comprehensive integrations with voice-control devices, we provide apps for Android and iOS mobile devices.
AI-driven automation. Our AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software uses the data from both our and partner devices to enable our subscribers to have a true smart home experience. Because our trained and experienced in-home service professionals (“Smart Home Pros”) install the right devices in the right places in the home, it enables us to collect superior data and generate unique insights. We believe that we have the broadest, deepest, and purest home activity dataset, which we use to understand the state of the home in real time. This enables us to intelligently manage the residence on the homeowners’ behalf, while still keeping them informed and in full control. 
Vivint Assist processes home events such as interactions with lights, locks, thermostats, touchscreens, voice-control devices, and door and motion sensors; thermodynamic data such as interior and exterior temperature and heating/cooling duty cycles; location data from mobile devices; and users’ interactions with Vivint Assist itself. Our software learns from key interactions, enriching our platform and making the smart home experience smarter. We believe that no other company is as well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to make the true smart home a reality.
Privacy and security. Much of the information that our technology manages on our subscribers’ behalf, including sensor data, video, and the insights gleaned by Vivint Assist, is sensitive and private, and we take our responsibility to protect this information seriously. We use this data to make our products smarter and provide intelligent suggestions to homeowners based on their daily routines, such as asking to lock doors or close the garage doors. Our subscribers trust us to help them manage their homes, which we consider a unique relationship that we strive to strengthen.
Curated partner relationships. We allow a select number of third-party, standalone devices into our system when doing so enhances the smart home experience for our subscribers. These may be devices that have a large installed base or that have unique capabilities, such as voice assistants. Using the Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant integrations for example, subscribers can use their voice to control their lights, change the temperature, make sure their garage doors are closed, lock their doors, or perform other actions. Other product and technology partnerships include AT&T, Chamberlain, Google Nest, Kwikset, Linear, Linksys, Philips Hue, Verizon, 2GIG and a variety of Z-Wave-enabled device manufacturers.
Seamless integration and support. We ensure that all partner devices are seamlessly integrated into our smart home platform, and that we are able to manage and support them as well as our own proprietary devices. This curated, partner-neutral 
Table of Contents

approach is designed to provide our subscribers with a worry-free, end-to-end experience from sale to installation through a lifetime of use and support.
Reliability. The smart home requires an operating system that is always-on, reliable, able to process large streams of incoming data, and protected by enterprise-grade security. We deliver new functionality continually, deploying weekly and bi-weekly updates to our software. We also push firmware updates to smart home devices throughout the year to deliver new functionality and improve device performance. We ensure that all of the mundane tasks of device management - security, firmware upgrades, telemetry, diagnostics, and more - are taken care of, so that the system is as reliable as possible. 
Increased usability and intelligence. With the vertical integration of the development and design of our products and services with our existing sales and customer service functions, we believe we are able to more quickly respond to market needs, and better understand our subscribers’ interactions and engagement with our system. This provides critical data which allows us to improve the power, usability and intelligence of our products and technology. 
Continuous innovation. Our Vivint Innovation Center headquartered in Lehi, Utah, and our research and development office in Boston, Massachusetts, focus on the research and development of new products and services, both within and beyond our existing offerings. Our innovation centers include people with expertise in all aspects of the development process, including hardware development, software development, design, and quality assurance. We believe that continuously improving the smart home experience will increase the lifetime value of our current subscribers and attracts new subscribers.
Our Products 
Our smart home products are designed to work as part of an integrated system, with features and capabilities that are often not present in devices designed primarily for standalone purchase and use. Our broad device portfolio enables our subscribers to achieve a comprehensive experience, across the entire home. 
Some of our key products include:
•Vivint Smart Hub - a 7-inch touchscreen hub that seamlessly connects all smart home devices and makes it easy to control the home. 
•Vivint Smart Home App – a single mobile app to control all of the smart home devices in a comprehensive Vivint smart home.
•Vivint Doorbell Camera Pro – an AI-powered doorbell camera with advanced analytics and Smart Deter technology to intelligently detect packages and actively help protect them from porch pirates and other potential threats. 
•Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro – an AI-powered security camera that uses advanced analytics and Smart Deter technology to intelligently detect and deter lurkers around the home.
•Vivint Indoor Camera – an indoor camera with two-way talk and one-touch callout so families can easily connect and communicate.
•Vivint Smart Thermostat – a thermostat that provides a new level of intelligence for temperature control and energy savings by integrating with all the door, window and motion sensors in a Vivint smart home. 
•Vivint Car Guard – a first-of-its-kind service that allows homeowners to manage the security of both their home and car with a single app. 
Our range of other devices, including smart locks, garage door control, door and window sensors, motion sensors, glass break detectors, key fobs, emergency pendants, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and water sensors extend the smart home experience to every part of the home, connecting users to their environments in new ways.
High-Performing Scalable Economic Model
We believe our end-to-end solution, long-term customer relationships, and subscription-based, high-margin recurring revenues drive significant lifetime value.
Our business is driven by the acquisition of new subscribers and by managing and retaining our existing subscriber base. Historically, the acquisition of new subscribers required significant upfront investment. To provide even greater subscriber accessibility and affordability to our Products and Services and improve our cash flow economics, in 2017 we launched Vivint Flex Pay, which enables qualified subscribers to purchase smart home devices with unsecured financing either through a third-party financing partner or through us, in most cases at zero percent annual percentage rate (“APR”). Vivint Flex Pay significantly reduced this upfront investment to acquire new subscribers and in turn dramatically improved our customer economics. Our Net Subscriber Acquisition Cost per New Subscriber decreased from $1,189 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $139 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a reduction of approximately 88%.
Table of Contents

Our existing subscriber base generates predictable, high-margin recurring revenue (with approximately 79% net service margins for the year ended December 31, 2020) from our cloud-enabled smart home solutions. Therefore, we focus our investment decisions on acquiring new subscribers in the most cost-effective manner while striving to maximize existing subscriber retention and lifetime. We drive long-term subscriber retention through our high-quality subscriber experience, from the time of first contact to day-to-day use. For example, our average subscriber engages with our smart home app multiple times per day. 
We will continue investing in innovative technologies that we believe will make our platform more valuable and engaging for subscribers, and we intend to continue investing in new subscriber acquisition channels to further improve the economics of our business model. We will also continue working to improve the lifetime value of our customers and the unit economics of our business by continually enhancing the smart home experience and identifying adjacent in-home products and services that leverage our smart home platform and customer relationships.
Sales and Marketing
Our go-to-market strategy is based on directly educating consumers about the value and benefits of a smart home experience. We reach consumers through a variety of highly efficient customer acquisition channels, including our direct-to-home and inside sales channels. Our nationwide sales and service footprint covers the majority of U.S.zip codes. Regardless of sales channel, our tech-enabled sales professionals always take a consultative approach to the sales process, educate potential subscribers on the benefits of smart home technology, and tailor a solution that serves each subscriber’s needs. This consultative sales process has enabled us to achieve a high adoption rate of our smart home solutions. 
Direct-to-Home Sales
Our direct-to-home tech-enabled sales representatives provide an in-home consultative sale to help homeowners understand the benefits of a smart home. Markets are selected each year based on a number of factors, including demographics, population density and our past experience selling in these markets. We also have a program whereby a number of direct-to-home sales representatives reside in certain select markets and sell in those markets on a year-round basis. We expect the number of new subscriber contracts generated through this program to continue to increase over time.
In response to the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease that was identified in late 2019 (“COVID-19”), during 2020 we implemented a number of new operating and safety protocols in accordance with the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), to protect the safety of our customers and customer-facing employees. These measures included:
•Daily "fitness-for-duty" assessments for all customer-facing employees, which include temperature and symptom checks.
•Contacting customers in advance of scheduled in-home service and installation appointments, to determine if anyone in the home is experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or has been exposed to someone with COVID-19, and rescheduling appointments if necessary.
•Following CDC guidelines for social distancing and sanitation.
•Using personal protective equipment during home visits, such as face coverings and gloves.
National Inside Sales
Our national inside sales channel provides a consultative experience for consumers who contact us. The inside sales channel generates leads through multiple sources, both digital and traditional, including paid, organic and local search, as well as display advertising. Driven by increasing brand awareness and marketing effectiveness, the number of new subscribers acquired through this channel in 2020 increased 18% compared to 2019. We believe that we will continue to experience growth in this channel as our brand awareness improves and customers’ understanding of the benefits of a smart home increases. 
Marketing Strategy
We are building a national brand across all our channels. Key to becoming a household name, we partner with celebrity ambassadors who are well-known, liked and trusted among our key demographics. Our celebrity ambassador campaigns are built around narrative storytelling and humor as the vehicle for delivering our primary message of “Smart security. Professionally installed.” We invest in certain marketing strategies which amplify the brand and awareness of our solutions, including through general paid media outlets. We also have exclusive brand naming rights for the Vivint Arena, home of the NBA’s Utah Jazz.

Field Operations
When it comes to creating a smart home experience, we believe many homeowners want and need professional help to set up their systems and to ensure that they are fully functional. We deploy Smart Home Pros throughout North America to provide professional installation and prompt tech-enabled services to our subscribers. In contrast to DIY solutions, we provide professional, white glove installation, followed by ongoing in-home service, customer support and 24/7 professional monitoring.
In addition to providing high quality installation and services, Smart Home Pros also deliver tailored in-home customer service. Our Smart Home Pros work together with customers to determine the most effective installation plan. Because of their experience and expertise, Smart Home Pros can offer recommendations for additional, industry-leading products to ensure the customer’s system provides the highest possible functionality and security. As part of the installation process, the customer is trained on how to use the system and Smart Home Pros work to answer any questions and address any customer concerns. We believe this customer-focused attention sets Vivint apart from our competition.
Our Smart Home Pros that provide in-home service and installation are also subject to the COVID-19 safety protocols discussed above under "Direct-to-Home Sales"
Customer Care and Monitoring 
Our customer service team responds to non-emergency inquires related to service and billing. In many cases, they can remotely troubleshoot system issues, without the need to send a Smart Home Pros technician to the home. Our customer service centers operate 24/7 year-round and are fully redundant across multiple locations. Our team has won multiple awards for customer service including the Business Intelligence Group’s “Excellence in Customer Service” award in 2019. We continue to improve our customer care offerings with online self-help tools and resources. Customer service representatives are required to pass background checks and, depending upon their job function, may require licensing.
Our two central monitoring facilities are located in Utah and Minnesota and are capable to act as primary backups for each other and operate 24/7 year-round, including on holidays. Our professional monitoring teams respond to medical, fire, flood, carbon monoxide and burglary alerts within seconds and relay appropriate information to first responders, such as local police, fire departments or medical emergency response centers. Our team has twice won the Monitoring Association’s “Monitoring Center of the Year” award, the highest accolade for central monitoring stations. All professionals who work in our monitoring facilities undergo comprehensive training and are required to pass background checks and, in certain cases, licensing tests or other checks.
Our Customers
We had approximately 1.7 million subscribers in North America as of December 31, 2020. Our business is not dependent on any single subscriber or a few subscribers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the respective market or on us as a whole. No individual subscriber accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated 2020 revenue.
Subscriber Contracts
We seek to ensure that our subscribers understand their smart home system, along with the key terms of their contracts by conducting two surveys with every subscriber. The first survey is conducted live via a digital interface prior to the execution of the contract and professional installation, and the second survey is conducted after the installation is completed. Each survey is recorded and stored in our subscriber relationship management and billing system software, enabling easy access and review.
Types of Contracts
When signing up for our Services, subscribers currently have the following three ways to pay for their Products: (1) qualified customers in the United States may finance the purchase of Products through a third-party financing provider ("Consumer Financing Program" or "CFP"); (2) we offer to a limited number of customers not eligible for the CFP, but who qualify under our underwriting criteria, the option to enter into a retail installment contract (“RIC”) directly with us or; (3) customers may purchase the Products at the outset of the service contract by check, automatic clearing house payments (“ACH”), credit or debit card ("Pay-in-Full" or "PIF"). We receive recurring revenue for Services on a month-to-month basis from these subscribers. When a subscriber signs up under the CFP program, we receive cash from the third-party financing provider for the subscriber’s purchase of products and the related installation costs. For certain third-party provider loans, we pay a monthly fee based on either the average daily outstanding balance of the loans or the number of outstanding loans, depending on the third-party financing provider. Additionally, we share in liabilities for credit losses depending on the credit quality of the customer. For other third-party loans, we receive net proceeds (net of fees and expected losses) for which we have 
Table of Contents

no further obligation to the third-party financing provider. RIC financing is available to a limited number of subscribers who do not qualify for the CFP based, among other things, on their credit profile. Going forward, we expect the number of Product purchases financed through RICs to be minimal.
Term and Termination
Historically, we have generally offered contracts to subscribers that range in length from 36 to 60 months, subject to automatic monthly renewal after the expiration of the initial term. A majority of new subscribers enter into 60-month contracts. As a result, the average initial contract length has increased over time, reaching an average of 51 months as of December 31, 2020. In limited circumstances, generally when the customer pays for their Products upfront, we offer a month-to-month contract at the time of origination. Subscribers have a right of rescission period prescribed by applicable law during which such subscriber may cancel the contract without penalty or obligation. Generally, these rescission periods range from 3 to 15 days, depending on the jurisdiction in which a subscriber resides. As a company policy we provide new subscribers 70 years of age and older a 30-day right of rescission. If the subscriber rescinds during the applicable rescission period under the terms of the contract, the subscriber is required to return the applicable equipment. Once the applicable rescission period expires, the subscriber is responsible for the monthly services fees under the contract.
Other Terms
We provide our subscribers with maintenance free of charge for the first 120 days. After 120 days, we will repair or replace defective smart home devices without charge, but we typically bill the subscriber a charge for each service visit. If a utility or governmental agency requires a change to our platform or tech-enabled service after installation of the system, the subscriber may be charged for the equipment and labor associated with the required change. We also charge subscribers a monthly fee related to the cost of maintaining our cellular communication network.
We do not provide insurance or warrant that the system will prevent a burglary, fire, hold-up or any such other event. Our contracts limit our liability to a maximum of $2,000 per event and, where permissible, provide a one-year statute of limitations to file an action against us. We may cease or suspend tech-enabled monitoring and repair service due to, among other things, work stoppages, weather, phone service interruption, government requirements, subscriber bankruptcy or non-payment by subscribers after we have given notice that their service is being canceled due to such non-payment.
Billing and Collections
A majority of our subscribers pay electronically either via ACH, credit or debit card, with approximately 89% paying electronically as of December 31, 2020. Our subscribers billed via direct invoice can be billed on any day of the month, with payment due 15 days subsequent to the invoice date. Subscribers are billed in advance for their monthly services based on their billing cycle and not calendar month. In those jurisdictions where we are entitled to do so by law, we charge late fees to subscribers whose accounts are more than 10 days past due.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights are important to our business and we continually refine our intellectual property strategy to maintain and improve our competitive position. We seek to protect new intellectual property to safeguard our ongoing technological innovations and strengthen our brand, and we believe we take appropriate action against infringements or misappropriations of our intellectual property rights by others. We review third-party intellectual property rights to help avoid infringement, and to identify strategic opportunities. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements to further protect our intellectual property.
Our portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents consists of 337 issued patents and additional pending-patent applications that relate to a variety of smart home, security and other technologies utilized in our business. We also own a portfolio of trademarks, including domestic and foreign registrations for Vivint, and are a licensee of various patents from our third-party suppliers and technology partners.
Competition
The smart home industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our major competitors range from large-cap technology companies (e.g., Amazon and Google) which predominantly offer DIY devices to expand their core market opportunity, to security-based providers such as ADT, Alarm.com, Brinks, FrontPoint, Guardian and SimpliSafe. We also face competition from industrial and telecommunications companies that offer connected home experiences such as Arlo, Comcast Xfinity 
Table of Contents

Home, Cox Communications, Honeywell, Resideo and Samsung. Historically, the vast majority of companies have not offered comprehensive smart home solutions and accompanying services that meet the growing requirements of households. 
We believe we compete effectively with each of our competitors, but we expect competition to intensify in the future. We face increasing competition from competitors who are building their own smart home platforms, such as Amazon, Apple and Google, as well as from companies that offer single-point connected devices. Having installed more than 2.8 million smart home and security systems, we believe we are well positioned to compete because we benefit from more than 21 years of experience; our efficient direct-to-home and inside sales channels; integrated smart home platform; innovative products; and our award-winning customer service.
Government Regulations
United States
We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities.
We are also required to obtain various licenses and permits from state and local authorities in connection with the operation of our businesses. The majority of states regulate in some manner the sale, installation, servicing, monitoring or maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. In the states that do regulate such activity, our company and our employees are typically required to obtain and maintain licenses, certifications or similar permits from the state as a condition to engaging in the smart home and security services business.
In addition, a number of local governmental authorities have adopted ordinances regulating the activities of security service companies, typically in an effort to reduce the number of false alarms in their jurisdictions. These ordinances attempt to reduce false alarms by, among other things, requiring permits for individual electronic security systems, imposing fines (on either the subscriber or the company) for false alarms, discontinuing police response to notification of an alarm activation after a subscriber has had a certain number of false alarms, and requiring various types of verification prior to dispatching authorities.
Our sales and marketing practices are regulated by the federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations typically place restrictions on the manner in which products and services can be advertised and sold, and to provide residential purchasers with certain rescission rights. In certain circumstances, consumer protection laws also require the disclosure of certain information in the contract with our subscriber and, in addition, may prohibit the inclusion of certain terms or conditions of sale in such contracts. Many local governments regulate direct-to-home sales activities and contract terms and require that salespeople and the company on whose behalf the salesperson is selling obtain licenses to carry on business in that municipality.
In addition, the CFP and RICs are subject to federal and state laws. These laws primarily require that consumer financing contracts include or be accompanied by certain prescribed disclosures, but these laws also may place limitations on particular fees and charges, and require licensing or registration of the party extending consumer credit. Citizens and any other financing partners providing third-party consumer financing under Vivint Flex Pay are responsible for compliance with such laws applicable to Vivint Flex Pay, and we are responsible for compliance with such federal and state laws regulating RICs.
Canada
Companies operating in the smart home and electronic security service industry in Canada are subject to provincial regulation of their business activities, including the regulation of direct-to-home sales activities and contract terms and the sale, installation and maintenance of smart home and electronic security systems. Consumer protection laws in Canada also require that certain terms and conditions be included in the contract between the service provider and the subscriber.
A number of Canadian municipalities require subscribers to obtain licenses to use electronic security alarms within their jurisdiction. Municipalities also commonly require entities engaged in direct-to-home sales within their municipality to obtain business licenses.
Data Privacy and Security
In the course of our operations, we gather, process, transmit and store subscriber information, including personal, payment, credit and other confidential and private information. We may use this information for operational and marketing purposes in the course of operating our business. Our collection, retention, transfer and use of this information are governed by U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, industry standards and protocols, or it may be asserted that such industry standards or protocols apply to us. In North America, federal and various state and provincial governmental bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations limiting, or laws and regulations regarding the collection, distribution, use, disclosure, storage, and security of certain categories of 
Table of Contents

information. These new laws and regulations may also impact the way we design and develop new technology solutions. Some of these requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from exploitation of a vulnerability in our systems or services, or from breaches experienced by our service providers and/or partners. We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding telemarketing and other telephonic communications and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts or SMS messages.
Many jurisdictions have established their own data security and privacy legal and regulatory frameworks with which we or our vendors or partners must comply to the extent our operations expand into these geographies or the laws and regulations in these frameworks otherwise may be interpreted to apply to us. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, internet protocol addresses. We are also bound by contractual requirements relating to privacy, data protection and information security, and may agree to additional contractual requirements addressing these matters from time to time.
Seasonality
Our direct-to-home sales are seasonal in nature with a substantial majority of our new customer originations generally during a sales season from April through August. We make investments in the recruitment of our direct-to-home sales force and the inventory prior to each sales season. We experience increases in subscriber contract costs during these time periods.
The management of our sales channels has historically resulted in a consistent sales pattern that enables us to more accurately forecast customer originations.
Human Capital Management
As a smart home platform company that provides home services to our customers, we know that our success relies heavily on our ability to attract, develop and retain top talent who are committed to delivering the peace of mind our customers expect. We recognize that delivering this peace of mind means we must understand the needs of our diverse customer base and the communities we serve across North America. The best way to do this is to employ top talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and experience that can connect with our customer’s needs.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 12,100 people including our seasonal direct sales and installation force, of which 11,960 were employed in the United States and 140 were employed in Canada. Less than 0.5% of our field-based employees were, as of December 31, 2020, represented by a union organization. However, in February 2021, we received a petition signed by the majority of these employees notifying the company of their desire to withdraw from the union. While we have maintained an open and productive working relationship with the union at all relevant times, upon receipt of the aforementioned petition, we notified the union that we no longer recognize them as representing our employees.
We place a premium on inclusion and strive to continually engage employees on ways to fully realize one of our core values of “We Win Together.” We believe this is a critical component of our strategies for attracting and retaining talent. One way we accomplish this is through Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”s), including our Vivint Pride, Vivint Veterans, Vivint Women and Vivint EDGE (Ethnically Diverse Group of Employees), as well as our Diversity Council. Our ERG programs are staffed by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. We use these groups to provide guidance to the organization on opportunities to improve inclusion across Vivint, to provide mentorship opportunities for our employee base, and to support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. Each ERG is sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise. In 2020, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by Forbes as one of “America's Best Employers for Diversity.” Approximately 37% of our employee base self identifies as ethnically diverse and approximately 20% of our employee base self identifies as female. 
Attracting talent
Attracting top talent starts at the candidate pipeline stage. Our talent acquisition team works closely with managers to develop job descriptions that are inclusive, to attract a broad spectrum of candidates. We work with many groups and networks including universities, alumni networks, job boards, diverse affinity groups, Utah’s Women Tech Council and veterans groups in order to cast a wide net to identify a diverse slate of qualified candidates. 
Developing Talent
Table of Contents

We are committed to the continued development of our employees. We rely heavily on experiential learning through stretch assignments, projects and other on-the-job opportunities while layering in mentoring, coaching, and formal training as appropriate to facilitate talent development. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned annual cadence across all business areas. The CEO and Senior Vice President of Human Resources hold meetings with senior leadership to review top talent, identify opportunities to develop and stretch our talent, and develop action plans to mitigate retention risks and talent gaps. This approach has enabled us to continue providing formal career growth to our internal employees with over 80% of open management positions being filled internally in 2020.
Retaining Talent
An important component of retention is a competitive total rewards package which includes:
•Competitive compensation that incentivizes performance
•Comprehensive health insurance coverage 
•Access to our on-site clinic for Utah County based employees, which delivers personalized health care and wellness solutions for our employees, including access to mental health professionals at a nominal cost
•Life insurance and disability leave
•401(k) matching
•Paid parental leaves for birth, adoption, or foster placement
•PTO for our hourly employees and unlimited paid time away for our salaried employees 
While a competitive total rewards program provides a solid foundation for retention, we believe it is critical to continually focus on ensuring our employees are highly engaged and feel valued. Our leaders hold regular one-on-one meetings, where leaders take time to connect with their employees, and to understand what is working well for them and areas for improvement and development. We also conduct an annual company-wide engagement survey and pulse surveys throughout the year to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics including, but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities, how we live our values and improvements we can make. We then develop plans to address opportunities for improvement, based on the survey results. 
Health and Safety 
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for all our employees. This requires us to identify the specific hazards within the unique working environments of our sales, service, installation and corporate operations. We use leading indicators reported through Job Safety Analysis and Job Safety Observation (audits) to provide an assessment of prevailing hazards identified on the job. Both indicators provide leaders with data that enables real-time coaching and engagement conversations while providing the Health and Safety Team analysis of the workplace hazards, for training and policy development. In addition, we utilize a number of measures including Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”), and Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate (“LTIR”), to measure the overall effectiveness of our health and safety program. For 2020, we had a TRIR of 1.7, a LTIR of 1.02 and zero work-related fatalities.
In 2020, one of our primary focuses in this area was maintaining a healthy and safe work environment for our employees through the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented a number of initiatives, including standard operating procedures aimed at keeping our employees and customers safe when in customers’ homes; requiring appropriate personal protective equipment; moving a significant portion of our office-based employees to a work from home environment; offering paid time off for those who are diagnosed with and quarantined due to COVID-19; and making rapid testing available to our employees based in our Utah County offices through our on-site clinic.
Suppliers
We license certain communications infrastructure, software and services from Alarm.com to support subscribers using our Go!Control panel, which was approximately 8% of our Total Subscribers at December 31, 2020. These Go!Control panels are connected to Alarm.com’s hosted platform. Alarm.com also provides an interface to enable these subscribers to access their systems remotely. We also license certain intellectual property from Alarm.com for our subscribers using the SkyControl panel.
Generally, our hardware device suppliers maintain a stock of devices and key components to cover any minor supply chain disruptions. Where possible we also utilize dual sourcing methods to minimize the risk of a disruption from a single supplier. However, we also rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers for critical components of our solution. Replacing any sole source or limited source suppliers could require the expenditure of significant resources and time to redesign and resource these products.
