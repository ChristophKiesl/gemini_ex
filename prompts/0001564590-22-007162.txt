Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing products intended to transform the way calcified cardiovascular disease is treated. We aim to establish a new standard of care for medical device treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (“atherosclerosis”) through our differentiated and proprietary local delivery of sonic pressure waves for the treatment of calcified plaque, which we refer to as intravascular lithotripsy (“IVL”). Our IVL system (our “IVL System”), which leverages our IVL technology (our “IVL Technology”), is a minimally invasive, easy-to-use, and safe way to significantly improve patient outcomes. 
Our Products and Product Pipeline
 Our IVL catheters are cleared or approved for use in a number of countries and development programs are underway to expand indications and geographies. We are currently selling the following products in countries where we have applicable regulatory approvals:
Products for Treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease (“PAD”):
  
• | Our Shockwave M5 IVL catheter (the “M5 catheter”) and M5+ IVL catheter (“M5+ catheter”) are five-emitter catheters for use in our IVL System in “medium” vessels for the treatment of above-the-knee PAD. The M5 catheter was CE-Marked in April 2018 and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in July 2018. The M5+ catheter, for which we are currently initiating a limited market release in the United States and select international locations, was CE-Marked in November 2020 and cleared by the FDA in April 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Shockwave S4 IVL catheter (“S4 catheter”) is a four-emitter catheter for use in our IVL System in small vessels for the treatment of below-the-knee (“BTK”) PAD. The second version of our S4 catheter was cleared by the FDA in August 2019 and accepted by our EU notified body in May 2020 for use in our IVL System.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Product for the Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease (“CAD”):
  
• | Our Shockwave C2 IVL catheter (“C2 catheter”) is a two-emitter catheter for use in our IVL System for the treatment of CAD. The C2 catheter was CE-Marked in June 2018. In August 2019, we received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for our C2 catheters using our IVL System for the treatment of CAD. In August 2020, we submitted an application to the FDA for U.S. pre-market approval (“PMA”) of our C2 catheters, which was approved by the FDA in February 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our differentiated range of M5 catheters, M5+ catheters, S4 catheters, and C2 catheters enables delivery of IVL therapy of diseased vasculature throughout the body for calcium modification. Our IVL catheters resemble in form a standard balloon angioplasty catheter, the device most commonly used by interventionalists. This familiarity makes our IVL System easy to learn, adopt and use on a day-to-day basis.
 Since inception, we have focused on generating clinical data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our IVL Technology. These initial studies have consistently shown low rates of complications regardless of which vessel was being studied. In addition to gaining regulatory approvals or clearances, the data from our clinical studies strengthen our ability to drive adoption of IVL Technology across multiple therapies in existing and new market segments. Our past studies have also guided optimal IVL procedure technique and informed the design of our IVL System and future products in development. In addition, we also have ongoing clinical programs across several products and indications, which, if successful, will allow us to expand commercialization of our products into new geographies and indications. 
 During 2021, we were engaged in the following clinical trials:
  
• | DISRUPT CAD III: This global study was designed to support our PMA application and, together with the DISRUPT CAD IV study, our Shonin submission in Japan, for our C2 catheters. In October 2018, we received staged investigational device exemption (“IDE”) approval for our DISRUPT CAD III global study. We began enrollment in the DISRUPT CAD III global study in 2019 and completed enrollment in March 2020. We submitted CAD III data to the FDA to support PMA application approval. We commenced the U.S. launch of our C2 catheter following FDA approval in February 2021.

• | DISRUPT CAD IV: This study is designed, along with DISRUPT CAD III, to support our Shonin submission in Japan for our C2 catheters. We began enrollment in the DISRUPT CAD IV Japan study in 2019 and completed enrollment in April 2020. We submitted CAD III and CAD IV data to support our Shonin submission in March 2021, with regulatory approval of our C2 catheters in Japan anticipated in the first half of 2022.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DISRUPT CAD III Post-Approval Study (CAD PAS): This is a required post-approval study in the United States for our C2 catheters. We began the initial collection of data in the last quarter of 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the treatment of CAD, our combined CAD I – IV studies have demonstrated consistent safety and effectiveness outcomes for our IVL System in severely calcified coronary lesions prior to stenting in 683 patients.
  
• | DISRUPT PAD III. This global study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of IVL as a vessel preparation procedure in moderate to severely calcified superficial femoral and popliteal lesions, followed by a drug-coated balloon or stent. We began enrollment in the DISRUPT PAD III study in February 2017 and completed enrollment in May 2020. We disclosed the 30-day results of the study in November 2020. Our PAD III study is the largest randomized study in heavily calcified femoropopliteal lesions to date and demonstrated that our IVL Technology was superior to balloon angioplasty. PAD III also has an observational registry component. The additional registry data demonstrates that IVL reduces residual stenosis and vascular complications in a variety of peripheral lesions including calcified infrapopliteal PAD, and successfully facilitates large bore access for transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures. Enrollment in the registry portion was completed in June 2021 and we anticipate that the trial results of the registry portion will be disclosed in 2022.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we initiated the following PAD studies in 2021:
  
• | PAD+: This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to assess the safety and performance of the M5+ catheters in our IVL System to treat calcified peripheral arteries. PAD+ is intended to support approval in pre-market countries, and to assess continued safety and effectiveness in the United States. We began enrollment in the PAD+ study in February 2021 and completed enrollment in September 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BTK II: This is a post-market, prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to assess the effectiveness of IVL for treatment of BTK PAD. We began enrollment in the BTK II study in November 2021.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A development program is also currently underway to explore the ability of our IVL Technology to directly treat calcified aortic valves to safely reduce the symptoms of and potentially delay or negate valve replacement treatment for aortic stenosis (“AS”).
 The Opportunity 
 Atherosclerosis is a common disease of aging in which arteries become narrowed (“stenotic”) and the supply of oxygenated blood to the affected organ is reduced by the progressive growth of plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque is comprised of fibrous tissue, lipids (fat) and, when it progresses, calcium. This calcium is present both deep within the walls of the artery (“deep” or “medial” calcium) and close to the inner surface of the artery (“superficial” or “intimal” calcium). 
 The first two indications we are targeting with our IVL System are occlusive PAD, the narrowing or blockage of vessels that carry blood from the heart to the extremities, and CAD, the narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. In the future, we see significant opportunity in the potential treatment of AS, a condition in which the heart’s aortic valve becomes increasingly calcified with age, causing it to narrow and obstruct blood flow from the heart. 
 The market opportunity for PAD and CAD can generally be defined as interventional procedures performed to treat those diseases where severe or moderate arterial calcium is present. In addition, IVL is utilized in so called “large bore” endovascular procedures such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements (“TAVR”) and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (“EVAR”) to treat calcified arteries along the access route, typically the common femoral or iliac arteries, where calcified arteries can hinder the advancement of large-sized sheaths required to deliver these large-sized heart valves or endovascular grafts. The number of interventional procedures and prevalence of severe or moderate calcium vary by arterial segment, but the aggregate addressable market for IVL is estimated to be over $6.9 billion.
 Coronary IVL is utilized to treat patients with CAD undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”) who have severe or moderate arterial calcium that hinder a balloon angioplasty and subsequent stent implantation. According to Clarivate, over six million PCI procedures will be performed globally in 2022. A study published in the American Journal of 
 8

Cardiology in 2014 demonstrated that more than 30% of patients undergoing PCI have severely or moderately calcified lesions and this percentage is growing. Minimizing complications is particularly important in the coronary vessels, but current plaque modification devices carry meaningful safety risks and are inherently challenging to use, which is why these devices are used very sparingly for PCI procedures in patients with calcified coronary artery disease. Despite significant under-penetration of the market, these devices still represented a market of $230 million in 2021 within the United States alone, according to Clarivate; we believe this market is significantly larger globally. Due to the increasing prevalence of calcified cardiovascular disease, the market growth for plaque modification devices exceeds that of PCI procedure growth. We believe the safety, ease of use and efficient impact on calcium of our IVL System will result in rapid adoption and market expansion in markets where our C2 catheter is introduced. We believe there is an over $3.6 billion total addressable market opportunity for our IVL System to treat CAD.
 The PAD population in the United States has been estimated to be at least eight million people, according to the National Institutes of Health. Globally over 1.8 million interventions are performed annually to treat symptomatic occlusive PAD. The presence of severe and moderate calcium ranges between 50 – 70% in the iliac, femoropoliteal and infrapopliteal arterial beds that are treated as part of PAD interventions. Current technologies are often not able to safely and effectively treat heavily calcified vessels. Accordingly, we believe our IVL system to treat symptomatic occlusive PAD has a total addressable market opportunity of $1.9 billion.
 In addition to PAD treatment, lower extremity arteries are sometimes treated with IVL as part of separate endovascular procedures, specifically TAVR or abdominal or thoracic EVAR (“TEVAR”) procedures, where the iliac or common femoral arteries along the access vascular route are blocked by a calcified narrowing that prevents these relatively large catheters from passing from the lower extremities into the aorta to deliver their respective lifesaving therapies. In 2022 Clarivate estimates that 260,000 TAVR procedures will be performed globally and up to 20% of these procedures are at risk for barriers to transfemoral access due to calcium. Similarly, Clarivate estimates that 215,000 EVAR and TEVAR procedures are performed globally with up to 20% of procedures at risk due to calcified lower extremity arteries. IVL is able to treat these calcified arteries and enable these so-called large bore procedures to be performed via standard transfemoral access technique, thereby reducing a risk of increased complications due to alternative access methods. We estimate that in aggregate large bore access procedures represent an additional addressable market opportunity of over $200 million.
 The global market for aortic valve replacement (“AVR”), the main treatment for AS, is growing rapidly, and is dominated by the emergence of TAVR devices. TAVR has rapidly developed into a multibillion-dollar market globally. According to an article published in the Journal of Thoracic Disease in 2017, the global market for TAVR was anticipated to be over 175,000 procedures performed worldwide in 2020 and is expected to grow to over 400,000 by 2028. We believe our IVL System may be able to improve the treatment of AS among patients in whom currently available solutions are inadequate. We are currently working to develop an IVL catheter which we believe can safely and effectively treat patients with AS. If successful, we believe this represents a potential total addressable market of over $3 billion for our IVL System to treat AS. 
 Current Challenges 
 The primary approaches to treat vascular disease are angioplasty balloons (“balloons”), drug-coated balloons (“DCB”), bare metal stents, and DES. These devices all work by using pressurized balloons to expand the diseased blood vessels. Calcified plaque creates challenges for these therapies in achieving optimal outcomes in treating PAD and CAD because the calcified vessels fail to expand under safe pressures. This, in turn, can lead to acute failure, damage to the blood vessel, which increases the rate of restenosis (re-occlusion of the vessel following endovascular treatment) or complications requiring adjunctive tools, future re-interventions or conversion to bypass surgery. These complications are significantly increased when treating calcified cardiovascular disease and include dissections, embolization, restenosis, vessel perforations and vessel recoil. 
 Plaque modification devices (including atherectomy and specialty balloons) have enhanced the treatment of some moderately calcified cardiovascular lesions by improving the ability of stent and balloon therapies to effectively expand in the vessel. Atherectomy devices are designed to break or remove superficial calcium by cutting or sanding the calcium in order to improve vessel expansion. Specialty balloon devices incorporate metallic elements like wires and cutting blades onto standard balloons; these devices are intended to make discreet cuts in the plaque and surrounding tissue in order to improve vessel expansion. Despite improvements in plaque modification devices, significant limitations remain, including being difficult to use and creating complications and inconsistent efficacy. Further, because medial calcium is encased in the vessel wall, the existing plaque modification devices are unable to impact medial calcium without damaging the vessel. Combined, these limitations decrease the utilization of plaque modification devices for treating calcified cardiovascular disease, thereby reducing the clinical benefit of angioplasty and stent therapies compared to their use in non-calcified anatomies.

Calcified iliac and femoral arteries can hinder the delivery of large endovascular devices for other catheter-based procedures, including those that treat aortic aneurysms (endovascular aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair procedures), severe AS treated with TAVR, and cardiac support devices for high-risk PCI (e.g., Abiomed’s Impella). The standard practice for these procedures is to gain vascular access in the femoral artery and insert large diameter sheaths that facilitate the delivery of the treatment devices to the aorta or the heart. However, when significant calcium is present in these arteries, it can prevent delivery of the devices, and thus may require more invasive treatments, increase complications or prevent the device from being used altogether. For example, in up to 20% of patients, the transfemoral approach through the iliac and femoral arteries is not viable for TAVR delivery or creates risk of vessel trauma due to the extent of vascular calcification, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
 Our Solution 
 We have adapted the use of lithotripsy to the cardiovascular field with the aim of creating what we believe can become the safest, most effective means of addressing the growing challenge of cardiovascular calcification. Lithotripsy has been used to successfully treat kidney stones (deposits of hardened calcium) for over 30 years. By integrating lithotripsy into a device that resembles a standard balloon catheter, physicians can prepare, deliver, and treat calcified lesions using a familiar form factor, without disruption to their standard procedural workflow. Our differentiated IVL System works by delivering shockwaves through the entire depth of the artery wall, modifying calcium in the medial layer of the artery, not just in the intimal layer. The shockwaves crack this calcium and enable the stenotic artery to expand at low pressures, thereby minimizing complications inherent to traditional balloon dilations, such as dissections or tears. Preparing the vessel with IVL facilitates optimal outcomes with other therapies, including stents and drug-eluting technologies. Using IVL also avoids complications associated with atherectomy devices such as dissection, perforation, and embolism. When followed by an anti-proliferative therapy such as a DCB or DES, the micro-fractures may enable better drug penetration into the arterial wall and improve drug uptake, thereby improving the effectiveness of the combination treatment. 
Our IVL System 
 
 (Left) Our IVL System consisting of a generator, connector cable and IVL catheter. (Right) Our IVL System delivering lithotripsy directly to a calcified vessel
 
Our IVL System includes a generator, connector cable, and a variety of IVL catheters designed to treat PAD and CAD. Our IVL System employs our IVL Technology to crack calcium through short, microsecond bursts of sonic pressure waves, which are generated within the IVL catheter, travel through the vessel and crack calcium without harming the soft tissue. Our IVL catheters utilize multiple lithotripsy emitters that are integrated into a standard, semi-compliant balloon-catheter platform. The IVL catheter is advanced to the target lesion and the integrated balloon is inflated with fluid at a low pressure to make contact with the arterial wall. IVL is then activated through the generator with the touch of a button, creating a small bubble within the catheter balloon which rapidly expands and collapses. The rapid expansion and collapse of the bubble creates sonic pressure waves that travel through the vessel and crack the calcium, allowing the blood vessel to expand under low static pressure. 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to apply our IVL Technology as a platform to treat a wide array of indications throughout the cardiovascular system. Ultimately, our plan is to have a family of IVL catheters that can treat calcium-related diseases across a wide variety of vasculatures and structures.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development
 We invest in research and development efforts that advance our IVL Technology and related technology with the goal to expand and improve upon our existing product offerings. 
 We believe our ability to rapidly develop innovative products is attributable to the dynamic product innovation process that we have implemented, the versatility and leveragability of our core technology and the management philosophy behind that process. We have recruited and retained engineers and scientists with significant experience in the development of medical devices. We have a pipeline of products in various stages of development that are expected to provide additional commercial opportunities. Our research and development efforts are based in Santa Clara, California.
 Manufacturing
 The manufacturing of our IVL catheters is principally done at our facilities in Santa Clara, California, however in 2021 we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with a third-party contract manufacturer, pursuant to which the contract manufacturer began manufacturing a portion of our demand for our M5 catheters and we are currently in the process of qualifying the contract manufacturer to manufacture our M5+ catheters.
 We stock inventory of raw materials, components and finished goods at our facilities in California and finished products with our direct sales representatives, who travel to our hospital customers’ locations as part of their sales efforts. In addition, our contract manufacturer holds an inventory of raw materials, components, and finished goods at its manufacturing facility as necessary to support our catheter production requirements.
 Our electronics (i.e., our generators and connector cables) are produced by original equipment manufacturing partners using our design specifications. We rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components, and we generally have no long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers, as we order on a purchase order basis. Under our contract manufacturing arrangements with our catheter contract manufacturer, however, we make binding one-year purchase commitments, subject to certain adjustment mechanisms specified in the contract manufacturing agreement.
 11

In the United States, we generally ship our IVL products from Santa Clara to our hospital customers in the United States but also may sell our IVL products directly to our hospital customers through our direct sales representatives, who deliver such products to hospital customers in the field. We have also offered consignment sales arrangements to certain customers. Internationally, we ship our IVL products from Santa Clara to either our third-party logistics provider located in the Netherlands who then ships directly to hospital customers and distributors pursuant to purchase orders or from Santa Clara directly to hospital customers and distributors pursuant to purchase orders. We also ship to some customers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom (the “UK”) on a consignment basis from our third-party logistics provider located in the Netherlands. Our catheter contract manufacturer generally ships all products to our facility in Santa Clara, where the products are held in inventory until ready to be shipped to U.S. or international customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 217 operations and manufacturing employees.
 Our rigorous quality control management programs have earned us a number of quality-related manufacturing designations. Our manufacturing facilities are compliant with International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485:2016. In 2014, we achieved compliance with the European Union’s Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) (the “MDD”) and we are working to achieve compliance with the new Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) (the “MDR”), which supersedes, subject to certain transition provisions contained in the MDR, the MDD. We use regular internal audits to help ensure strong quality control practices. An internal, on-going staff training, and education program contributes to our quality assurance program and training is documented and considered part of the employee evaluation process. We are also subject to periodic audits by regulatory agencies.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market our IVL System to hospitals whose interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists treat patients with PAD and CAD. We have dedicated meaningful resources to establish direct sales capability in the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, and the UK which we have complemented with distributors actively selling in over 50 countries in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. In addition, in 2021, we began developing our direct sales capability in Japan in advance of our C2 catheter launch, for which we anticipate Japanese regulatory approvals in the first half of 2022. We have been adding new US sales territories and are actively expanding our international field presence through new distributors, and additional sales and clinical personnel and expanded direct sales territories. Of note, we have received the CE Mark in Europe and 510(k) clearance in the United States for our IVL System using our peripheral catheters (our M5 and M5+ catheters and S4 catheters) and CE Mark in Europe for our IVL System using our C2 catheters. In August 2020, we submitted a PMA application with the FDA relating to our C2 catheters in the U.S., which was approved by the FDA in February 2021.
 Our sales representatives and sales managers generally have substantial and applicable medical device experience, specifically in the vascular space and market our products directly to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists who treat patients with PAD and CAD. We are focused on developing strong relationships with our physician and hospital customers in order to educate them on the use and benefits of our products. Similarly, our marketing team has a significant amount of domain expertise and a strong track record of success. Our global sales and marketing team totaled 250 professionals as of December 31, 2021.
 In the United States, our IVL generators and connector cables may be sold, rented, or loaned to hospital customers, while our disposable IVL catheters are sold to hospital customers or may be provided on a consignment basis whereby title to such catheters passes to the hospital once they are used in a clinical procedure. In the consignment model, following such use, we charge the hospital a predetermined set fee for each IVL catheter, which fee may be determined based on the hospital’s overall use of our IVL catheters.
 In addition to our direct sales organizations, we sell to distributors in certain geographies outside the United States where we have determined that selling through third party distributors is the best way to optimize our opportunities and resources. We select distribution partners who have deep experience in our markets, have strong customer relationships and have a demonstrated track record of launching innovative products.
 Our IVL System is simple, intuitive, easy to install and easy to use. This provides value to our customers, but also makes our sales model a source of competitive advantage. Lower service burden means we can develop a cost-efficient sales model by optimizing a mix of clinical specialists and salespeople. Moreover, our coronary and peripheral IVL catheters have similar call points, meaning we can further leverage our field sales team.
 12

Reimbursement
 In the United States, our products are generally purchased by hospitals, which in turn normally bill various third-party payors, including government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance plans, for the healthcare services required to treat each patient. The applicable third-party payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure or product, and, if so, the amount for which the provider will be reimbursed for treatment. In the United States, there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product or service may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product or service once coverage is approved. Payors may limit coverage to specific products or services on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved or -cleared products for a particular indication.
 Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both.
 Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under healthcare payment systems in the markets where we sell and distribute our products. We cannot assure you that government or private payors will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures performed using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will continue to be adequate.
 In addition, we expect that we will continue to see pressure globally by third-party payors to manage the cost of healthcare. Cost management may come in a variety of forms, including rules and practices of third-party payors, judicial decisions, laws and regulations, group purchasing and managed care organizations, and medical device reimbursement policies. Cost management could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our products and impact demand for our products, product pricing, reimbursement, and usage, and which, in turn, may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations.
 Competition
 The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with manufacturers and distributors of cardiovascular medical devices. The cardiovascular field is highly competitive and certain of our products may compete with products manufactured by other companies, including Boston Scientific Corporation, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (“CSI”), Medtronic plc and Philips N.V. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:

• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more established distribution networks;
--+----------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our proprietary IVL Technology, our focus on calcified cardiovascular disease and our organizational culture and strategy, will be important factors in our future success. We compete primarily on the basis that our products are designed to treat patients with calcified cardiovascular disease safely, easily, and effectively, with improved outcomes and procedural cost savings. Our continued success depends on our ability to:
  
• | develop innovative, proprietary products that can cost-effectively address significant clinical needs in a manner that is safe and effective for patients and easy to use for physicians;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to innovate and develop scientifically advanced technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstrate efficacy in our sponsored and third-party clinical trials and studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | apply technology across product lines and markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | attract and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cost-effectively manufacture and successfully market and sell products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 52 issued U.S. patents and 73 issued foreign patents, 18 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 28 pending foreign patent applications (including five Patent Cooperation Treaty applications). This portfolio includes 22 issued U.S. patents, 37 issued foreign patents, five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and six pending foreign patent applications relating to our current IVL Technology.
 On January 18, 2022 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued two opinions affirming the previous decisions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board, finding that the claims for U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,642,673 and 8,728,091, which were two of our issued U.S. patents relating to our current IVL Technology, are unpatentable following an inter partes review (“IPR”) proceedings filed by CSI, one of our competitors. U.S. Pat. No. 8,956,371, which is another of our issued U.S. patents relating to our current IVL Technology, remains the subject of an IPR proceeding also filed by CSI. For more information regarding these proceedings, see the section titled “Legal Proceedings.”
 These issued patents, and any patents granted from such applications, are expected to expire between 2029 and 2041, without taking potential patent term extensions or adjustments into account. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. We aim to protect our innovation with patents, but we cannot be sure that any applications we file will issue as patents, that any patents we obtain will withstand challenge or invalidation, or that we will obtain sufficient patent protection for innovation that turns out to be more important than anticipated.

 Government Regulation
 Our products are medical devices subject to extensive laws, rules, and regulations of various U.S. federal and state, and international regulatory bodies in each of the markets in which we sell or distribute our products. These laws, rules and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, pricing and discounts, post-marketing surveillance and interactions with healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us or one or more of our products to a variety of sanctions, such as loss of product approvals/clearances/certifications, issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, civil monetary penalties and judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.

United States
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it qualifies for an exemption as outlined below, De Novo authorization, or a PMA from the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

• | Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the U.S. federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), such as provisions that relate to adulteration, misbranding, registration and listing, notification (including repair, replacement, or refund), records and reports, and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from the premarket notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls may include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and guidance documents. It is typical for Class II devices to be subject to a requirement for clearance under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after review of a PMA application. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on Class III devices to ensure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 510(k) Clearance Pathway. When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to market a device, and we must receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA before we actually market the device. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments performance goal for a traditional 510(k) clearance is 90 days. As a practical matter, however, clearance often takes longer, because the review clock is paused by the FDA to allow time to resolve any questions the FDA may have. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, we must show that the proposed device (1) has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (2) it either has (a) the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or (b) if the proposed device has different technological characteristics than the predicate device, that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III.
 There are three types of 510(k) clearance: traditional, special, and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are typically for devices that have certain technological, design or labelling changes that require a new 510(k) but where the method(s) to evaluate the changes are well established and the results of change evaluation can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to special controls for the device type or to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for any particular device, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
 De Novo Classification Pathway. If a novel device is low risk but lacks a predicate device, it may be eligible for de novo classification. In this process, the FDA by order creates a new classification regulation placing the novel device in Class I or II. This process is lengthier and more expensive than a 510(k) review. For instance, the FDA requires that the premarket notification be submitted 150 days, rather than 90 days, before the day that the device is intended to be marketed. This 
 15

process is, however, quicker and less expensive than the PMA pathway described below. Once the classification regulation is established, subsequent devices in this type can use the 510(k) pathway.
 Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA application under Section 515 of the FD&C Act must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. The granting of a PMA is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). 
 After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are an important factor in the FDA’s overall decision-making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The FDA also may inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure the validity of the data and compliance with applicable FDA regulations.
 Upon completion of the PMA application review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an “approvable letter” which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a “not approvable letter” which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
 Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. 
 During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of the FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 
 16

Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.
 Ongoing Regulation by the FDA. Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements will apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II and Class III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”) requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular QSR inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, CDHS or other state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing approvals/clearances that have already been granted; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 The medical device reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or information that reasonably suggests a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Our approach has been to file such reports with the FDA even in cases where reporting might not otherwise be required out of an abundance of caution. 
 In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the 
 17

FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
 Anti-Kickback Statute. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.
 There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there may be limited or no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities, such as reimbursement support programs, educational and research grants, or charitable donations. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical devices, including discounts, providing items or services for free or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor and would be subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of our practices, such as the loaning of generators or consignment of catheters, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.
 The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Various states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar laws and regulations.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons, or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claims for payment of government fundsor knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Many pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities, including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable uses and interactions with prescribers and other customers, including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission of claims to the federal government.
 Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the subject entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend cases brought under the False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have adopted laws similar to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.
 Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knew, or should have known, was for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 18

Sunshine Act. The Affordable Care Act also included a provision, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires that any manufacturer of drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually, with certain exceptions, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with the reported information made public on a searchable website. Such reporting requirement was expanded by the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which requires manufacturers, beginning January 1, 2021, to report payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives in addition to physicians and teaching hospitals. Similar laws have been enacted at the state level and in foreign jurisdictions, including France.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
 Other Laws, Rules and Regulations. We are also subject to a variety of other U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including:
  
• | analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above U.S. federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and foreign laws that require medical device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state beneficiary inducement laws, which are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal, state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal, state, local and international laws relating to relating to safe working conditions, laboratory, and manufacturing practices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

International
 Regulation of medical devices in general. In addition to the rules and regulations described above, international sales of medical devices are subject to a variety of foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to be complex and evolving, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products, and require extensive compliance and monitoring obligations in the countries where we sell or distribute our products. 
 European Union. The European Union (the “EU”) has adopted numerous directives and standards harmonizing the requirements for the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Our products are regulated in the EU as medical devices per the MDR, which was published in May 2017 and came into application in May 2021, and which replaced, subject to certain transition provisions contained in the MDR, the MDD. Conformity with the MDD or MDR, as applicable, is indicated by the CE mark, which can be affixed by the manufacturer after a certificate of conformity is issued by the applicable Notified Body following the successful satisfaction of a variety of requirements. These requirements depend on the class of the product, but normally involve a combination of: (a) preparation of a design dossier; (b) self-assessment by the manufacturer; (c) a third-party assessment, which generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and manufacturing site by a Notified Body; and (d) review of the design dossier, which 
 19

may include safety and technical information, by the Notified Body. Our ability to affix the CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations and standards, including compliance with ISO 13485 and applicable vigilance and post-market surveillance.
 The MDR, among other things, expanded and modified the pre-market and post-market obligations of manufacturers under the MDD. We are currently relying on transitional provisions, which allow us to continue placing our products on the EU market until expiry of our current certificates of conformity issued under MDD, subject to compliance with certain conditions. However, we have updated our technical documentation and other quality management system processes in preparation for compliance with the MDR requirements. 
 United Kingdom. We anticipate that our compliance obligations under UK law will continue to increase and change following the departure of the UK from the EU as of January 1, 2021. Although the CE mark will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland whilst the Northern Ireland Protocol is in force, it will only be recognized in Great Britain until July 1, 2023, and after this date, an equivalent UK mark (UKCA mark) will become mandatory in Great Britain. We will only be able to affix the UKCA mark on our products following completion of a conformity assessment procedure which currently is based on that under the MDD, except that it needs to be supervised by a UK-based Approved Body. We will commence preparations to ensure we can use the UKCA mark by July 2023. The UK government has already made some changes to the MDD-derived regime, including requiring that we appoint a UK-based Responsible Person to serve a point of contact (where previously the UK would be covered by our EU-based Authorized Representative) and register our devices – and is considering further changes. We expect that over time the two processes will continue to diverge. 
 Other laws and regulations. In addition to laws regulating medical devices, our international operations, distribution and sales require us to comply with various rules of general application: the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions including the UK Bribery Act 2010 (the “UKBA”); U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws; U.S. and foreign tax laws; employment, immigration and labor laws; local intellectual property laws, which may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. law; and privacy laws such as the European General Data Protection Regulation and the UK equivalent. Some of these laws, for example the FCPA and the UKBA, have extraterritorial effect. In countries where we sell to our customers directly, we are also subject to more specific laws and codes that regulate interactions between manufacturers of medical devices and healthcare professionals. These rules also vary from country to country. 
 Regulatory Inspections
 We are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory entities, such as our European Notified Body, related to the regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured, and clinical trials sponsored, by us. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the investigators will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or Form FDA 483. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA following an inspection, we would be required to respond in writing, and would be required to undertake corrective and/or preventive or other actions in order to address the FDA’s or other regulators’ concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
Seasonality
 We have experienced some seasonality during summer months, which we believe is attributable to the postponement of elective surgeries for summer vacation plans of physicians and patients. We also anticipate that we may in the future experience some seasonal slowing of demand for our products in our fourth quarters due to year-end clinical treatment patterns, such as the postponement of elective surgeries during the holiday period. We expect these seasonal factors to become more pronounced in the future as our business grows.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 657 full-time employees worldwide, of which 383 were located at our headquarters in Santa Clara, California, 234 were remote and field-based employees throughout the country and 40 were located outside of the United States. Of these employees, 250 were in sales and marketing, 217 were in manufacturing and quality, 100 were in research and development, clinical and regulatory, and 90 were in general and administration. We routinely enter into contractual agreements with our employees, which typically include confidentiality and non-competition commitments. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining agreements with respect to their employment by us. However, in certain countries outside of the United States in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees in those countries subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage. 
 20

We believe that we have a good relationship with our workforce, our employees are a key factor in transforming the way calcified cardiovascular disease is treated by establishing a new standard of care for medical device treatment of atherosclerosis, and our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Our employee turnover for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 14%. We consider the turnover rate a valuable metric to measure the effectiveness of our programs and to assist in developing new programs. 
 To attract, develop, and retain talent, we emphasize:
  
• | Compensation and Benefits. We strive to provide a competitive mix of pay, benefits and services that help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include variable incentive compensation plans, potential annual discretionary bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others. In addition to our equity incentive programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. Accordingly, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We value diversity as a strength because we feel a diverse workforce leads to innovative ideas and solutions that help us change the way atherosclerosis is treated. We are an equal opportunity employer, and we maintain policies that prohibit unlawful discrimination, including based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital status, and veteran status. We are investing in the creation of a work environment where our employees can feel inspired to deliver their workplace best every day by developing and expanding our equality, diversity, and inclusion (“EDI”) initiatives across our entire workforce, including launching our EDI Council in 2020 to strengthen our EDI strategies and to further engage our employees in our EDI efforts and the establishment of a formal EDI policy in 2021 intended to create sustainable cultural change, led by our executive leadership and driven through diverse cross-functional teams. Our workforce was made up of approximately 50% female employees as of December 31, 2021, with 47% of management positions held by female employees.
