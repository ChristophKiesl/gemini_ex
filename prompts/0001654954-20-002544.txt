  Item 1.
 Business

 
 GENERAL
  
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company” or “PGI” refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are at 212 S. Central, St. Louis, Missouri, 63105, and its telephone number is (314) 512-8650.
  
 The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990’s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land. Over approximately the last 30 years, the Company’s business focus and emphasis changed substantially as it has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts almost exclusively on the disposition of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt.
  
 The Company’s remaining land inventory consists of 6 single family lots, an approximate 7 acre parcel and some other minor parcels of real estate consisting of easements in Citrus County, Florida, which are owned through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sugarmill Woods, Inc. (“Sugarmill Woods”). In addition, Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. (“PGIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 60 acres, but these parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale.
  
 QUALIFICATION AS INACTIVE REGISTRANT FOR SEC PURPOSES
  
 In early 2019, the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met and continues to meet all of the conditions under which a registrant may be deemed an “Inactive Entity” as that term is defined or contemplated in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and as the term “Inactive Registrant” is further contemplated in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance’s Financial Reporting Manual section 1320.2. Under Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X, the financial statements required thereunder with respect to an Inactive Registrant for purposes of reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including but not limited to annual reports on Form 10-K, may be unaudited. A representative of PGI informally discussed its view that PGI is an Inactive Registrant with a staff member of the Chief Accountant’s Office in the Division of Corporation Finance in February 2019.
  
 As an Inactive Registrant, PGI currently intends to continue to timely file Annual Reports on Forms 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including this Form 10-K, as well as Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q and any other required reports. PGI currently intends to include in such Annual Reports all annual consolidated financial statements required to be included therein pursuant to Regulation S-X. However, PGI will include annual consolidated financial statements that have been reviewed by a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) registered public accounting firm rather than audited.

  Item 1.
 Business (continued)

 
 PGI has engaged Milhouse & Neal to be the PCAOB registered public accounting firm that has reviewed its annual consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and its quarterly consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed for its fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019. PGI currently intends to include reviewed consolidated financial statements in its Forms 10-Q and Forms 10-K that it currently intends to file for its applicable fiscal periods hereafter.
  
 PGI meets all of the conditions in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X for an “Inactive Registrant” which are:
  
   (a)
 Gross receipts not in excess of $100,000;

   (b)
 Not purchasing or selling any of its own stock or granted options therefor;

   (c)
 Expenditures for all purposes not in excess of $100,000;

   (d)
 No material change in the business has occurred during the fiscal year;

   (e)
 No securities exchange or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the entity requires the entity to furnish audited financial statements.

 
 As the Company reviews its circumstances, it has met the conditions as an Inactive Registrant since 2017.
  
 The Company, formerly a Florida residential developer, is dormant with less than 70 acres of remaining landholdings, much of which has little value due to various restrictions. The Company’s consolidated financial statements show it has a Stockholders’ Deficiency of $92.6 million as of December 31, 2019. BKD, the Company’s PCAOB registered public accounting firm until the date the Company filed its Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018 which was February 25, 2019, expressed a “going concern” opinion with respect to the Company for its Fiscal 2018 financial statements and had expressed such opinions for many years previously. PGI has had no trading of its securities in many years. Any future real estate transactions by the Company will be limited, uncertain as to timing and as to value. Ultimately, PGI expects that proceeds from sales of its remaining real estate, if any, will provide some minimal recoveries for PGI’s senior debtholders. PGI has been an SEC registrant for over 40 years.
  
 As an Inactive Registrant, PGI currently intends to continue to provide comprehensive updates through its SEC filings.
