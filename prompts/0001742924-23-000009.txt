ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Livent Corporation was formed and incorporated by FMC Corporation as FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp. in the State of Delaware on February 27, 2018, and was subsequently renamed Livent Corporation ("Livent"). Prior to this time, our business was operated through various subsidiaries of FMC and their predecessors. Pursuant to a 2018 restructuring, FMC transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its lithium business to us in exchange for all of our common stock. We conducted our initial public offering of common stock in October 2018, and FMC completed the spin-off distribution of all remaining shares of our common stock that FMC owned in March 2019. We have been operating as an independent company since that time. Livent's principal executive offices are located at 1818 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103.

General    
We are a pure-play, fully integrated lithium company, with a long, proven history of producing performance lithium compounds. Our primary products, namely battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications. Our strategy is to focus on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast-growing electric vehicle ("EV") and broader battery markets, while continuing to maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal. With extensive global capabilities, nearly 80 years of continuous production experience, applications and technical expertise, long standing customer relationships and a favorable sustainability profile, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trends of vehicle electrification and renewable energy adoption.
We produce lithium compounds for use in applications that have specific and constantly changing performance requirements, including battery-grade lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries. We believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates, and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products. We also supply butyllithium, which is used in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products, as well as a range of specialty lithium compounds including high purity lithium metal, which is used in non-rechargeable batteries and in the production of lightweight materials for aerospace 

applications. It is in these applications that we have established a differentiated position in the market through our ability to consistently produce and deliver performance lithium compounds.
Livent Strategy
We believe that growth in EV sales will drive significant growth in demand for performance lithium compounds and that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend due to our leading position, long-standing customer relationships and favorable sustainability profile. We view sustainability as central to our mission and a key consideration in all of our investment and operational decisions.
To fully capitalize on our growth opportunities, our strategy will involve investing in our assets, our technology capabilities and our people to ensure we can continue to meet our customers’ growing demands as well as our broader commitments to other key stakeholders, including investors, employees, regulators and our local communities.
Expand our Production Capacities
We remain focused on expanding our lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide capacities. As planned, our lithium hydroxide expansion project at Bessemer City, North Carolina was mechanically completed by the end of 2022. We are well advanced on a 20,000 metric ton expansion of lithium carbonate in Argentina expected to come online in two equal phases in 2023 and early 2024, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022, we began engineering work on a second expansion to add an additional 30,000 metric tons of carbonate capacity in Argentina, with potential first production as early as the end of 2025. Upon completion, we would have total carbonate capacity in Argentina of approximately 70,000 metric tons. 
Construction has begun on an additional 15,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide capacity in China. This production asset will be located in the province of Zhejiang and is expected to be mechanically complete by the end of 2023. We are also evaluating the addition of a lithium recycling plant in North America or Europe. 
Nemaska Lithium, in which we currently have a 50% ownership interest, is a fully integrated development project in Québec, Canada which envisions a spodumene mine and concentrator in Whabouchi feeding into a new lithium hydroxide facility in Bécancour. The project is currently in late-stage engineering work and site clearing for the conversion facility in Bécancour. We expect Livent to lend its expertise to Nemaska Lithium, including technical support to progress the project and assistance with the development of an appropriate technical and commercial strategy, given our experience in qualifying and selling battery grade lithium products globally. 
Longer-term, we plan to expand our hydroxide capacity in multiple geographies in order to meet growing customer demand globally. We will also continue to evaluate our butyllithium capacity regionally and add capacity as demand continues to increase. For high purity lithium metal, we are evaluating expansion opportunities, including expansion of lithium chloride as a feedstock, to align with the potential increase in demand for lithium metal as customers develop next generation battery technologies. This includes opportunities for our proprietary LIOVIX® lithium metal product.
Diversify our Sources of Supply
We continue to pursue additional sources of lithium, which may include further expansion in Argentina, increasing our 50% ownership stake in the Nemaska Lithium Inc. development project and assets, acquisition and development of new resources, entering into long-term agreements with other producers, or some combination thereof. We will continually assess new resources that offer the potential to provide alternative sources of lithium products and will look to invest in developing such resources where it makes sense to do so.
Expand our Applications and Process Technology Capabilities
Our market position today depends on our ability to consistently provide our customers with the products they need, in a sustainable and responsible manner. To maintain this position, we are continuously investing to improve our application, process and extraction technologies, on both existing and new potential resources, and to reduce our environmental footprint. As we work with our customers to understand their evolving lithium needs, we will focus on expanding our extraction and processing capabilities and our ability to adapt the properties of our products, whether chemical or physical, to meet those needs. This may require us to invest in and potentially acquire new capabilities, hire people or acquire new technical resources.
Develop Next Generation Lithium Compounds
We believe that the evolution of battery technologies will lead to the adoption of lithium-based applications in the anode and electrolyte within the battery. This evolution will require new forms of lithium to be produced, such as new lithium metal powders or printable lithium products. We will continue to invest in our research and development efforts to help us create new products, such as LIOVIX®, and we will also invest with and partner with our customers to further their own research and development efforts.
Invest in Our People
Our business requires that we continue to hire, retain and engage research scientists, engineers and technical sales agents. We will continue to invest in our people through training and developing our employees to retain talent. We will look to continue to cultivate an inclusive and positive work environment that (i) creates and supports diversity; (ii) prioritizes equal opportunity and fairness in the company’s management systems and practices; and (iii) fosters a sense of belonging for employees with diverse perspectives, backgrounds and expertise.
Focus on Sustainability
We believe lithium will continue to play an important role in enabling a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable world, including the transition to a lower carbon future and the fight against climate change. Likewise, we believe that meeting the growing demand for lithium compounds must be balanced with considerations for responsible production across the spectrum of Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") issues and concerns. Our core values reflect this commitment to sustainability. We believe that operating in a safe, ethical, socially conscious and sustainable manner is important for our business. 
As such, we intend to continue to integrate ESG and sustainability considerations into our business, operations and investment decisions. In addition, we are determined to help set the standard in the lithium industry for sustainability, performance, transparency and independent validation. We believe that our ESG and sustainability efforts will continue to help us differentiate ourselves from competitors and help us develop and strengthen relationships with customers and other key stakeholders.
We encourage you to review our annual Sustainability Report and website (located at www.livent.com/sustainability) for more detailed information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives as well as our 2030 and 2040 sustainability goals. Nothing on our website, including our Sustainability Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Financial Information About Our Business
We operate as one reportable segment based on the commonalities among our products and services, the types of customers we serve and the manner in which we review and evaluate operating performance. As we earn a substantial amount of our revenues through the sale of lithium products, we have concluded that we have one operating segment for reporting purposes.
Business Overview
As a result of our focus on supplying performance lithium compounds for use in the rapidly growing EV and broader energy storage battery markets, we expect our revenue generated from lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate, energy storage and our Asia operations to increase. We intend to maintain our leadership positions in other high performance markets such as non-rechargeable batteries, greases, pharmaceuticals and polymers.
We believe that we have earned a reputation as a leading supplier in the markets we serve, based on the performance of our products in our customers’ production processes and our ability to provide application know-how and technical support. In the EV market, we are one of a small number of lithium suppliers whose battery-grade lithium hydroxide has been qualified by global customers for use in their cathode material production that is ultimately used in numerous global EV programs at scale. Throughout our history, as end market application technologies have evolved, we have worked closely with our customers to understand their changing performance requirements and have developed products to address their needs.
As a vertically integrated lithium producer, we benefit from operating one of the lowest cost lithium mineral deposits in the world that also has a favorable, industry leading sustainability footprint. We have been extracting lithium brine at our operations at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for more than 25 years, and have been producing various lithium compounds for approximately 80 years. Our operational history provides us with a deep understanding of the process of extracting lithium compounds from brine safely and sustainably. We have developed proprietary process knowledge that enables us to produce high quality, low impurity lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, and helps us to produce industry leading quality downstream products. We source the majority of our base lithium compounds for use in the production of performance lithium compounds from these low cost operations in Argentina. Our operations in Argentina are expandable, giving us the ability to increase our lithium carbonate and lithium chloride production to meet increasing demand. We also have the operational flexibility to procure lithium carbonate from third party suppliers as needed, allowing us to better manage our production requirements and produce more end-products for customers. 
We are one of a few lithium compound producers with global manufacturing capabilities. We use the majority of the lithium carbonate we produce in the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the U.S. and China. We use lithium chloride to produce lithium metal, a key feedstock in the production of butyllithium products in the U.S., the United Kingdom and China, as well as in the production of high purity lithium metal in the U.S. We have significant know-how and experience in lithium 

hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal production processes and product applications, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in these markets.

Products and Markets    
Our performance lithium compounds are frequently produced to meet specific customer application and performance requirements. We have developed our capabilities in producing performance lithium compounds through decades of interaction with our customers, and our products are key inputs into their production processes. Our customer relationships provide us with first-hand insight into our customers’ production objectives and future needs in terms of product volume, mix and specifications, which we in turn use to further develop our products. 
Other specialties include lithium phosphate, pharmaceutical-grade lithium carbonate, high purity lithium chloride and specialty organics. In addition to performance lithium compounds, we also produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, both of which we largely consume as feedstock today in the process of producing our performance lithium compounds.
Competition and Industry Overview
We sell our performance lithium compounds worldwide. Most markets for lithium compounds are global, with significant growth occurring in Asia, eventually expected to follow in Europe, and then the U.S. This is being driven primarily by the development and manufacturing of cathode active material for lithium-ion batteries. Cathode material capacity and production is currently concentrated in Asia, particularly China, Japan and Korea. Over the next few years, significant cathode material capacity and production is expected to come online in Europe and North America while capacity and production in China, Japan, Korea also increases. The market for lithium compounds faces barriers to entry, including access to an adequate and stable supply of lithium feedstock, the need to produce sufficient quality and quantity, technical expertise and development lead time. We expect capacity to be added by new and existing producers over time. We believe our lithium brines in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina, which have a favorable sustainability profile and are considered by the industry to be one of the lowest-cost sources of lithium, provide us with a distinct competitive advantage against current and future entrants. Additionally, as the EV supply chain gradually regionalizes to Europe and North America, our lithium resource in Argentina, 

downstream capabilities in the U.S. and the potential development of Nemaska Lithium in Canada (See subsection "Mineral Properties" to Item 2 for more information) position us well for partnering with leading automakers for their regional electrification roadmaps.
We compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner and prioritizing safety and sustainability. We also enjoy competitive advantages from our vertically integrated manufacturing approach, low production costs and history of efficient capital deployment. We believe that we are a leading provider of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in EV battery applications and in performance grease applications. We currently have lithium hydroxide capacity in the U.S. and China. We are also the only fully integrated producer of high purity lithium metal in the Western Hemisphere. We believe that we are one of only two global suppliers of butyllithium. Our primary competitors for performance lithium compounds are Albemarle Corporation and Ganfeng Lithium. 
Growth
According to BloombergNEF's June 2022 Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, under the Economic Transition Scenario ("ETS"), EV (battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric passenger vehicles) sales are expected to be approximately 39 million units in 2030, rising to approximately 73 million units in 2040, representing a penetration rate of 40% and 73%, respectively, of all passenger vehicles sold. According to EV Volumes’ January 2023 global battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles forecast, sales are expected to be approximately 46 million units in 2030, rising to approximately 74 million units in 2035, representing a penetration rate of 46% and 69%, respectively, of all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold. Both BloombergNEF, and EV Volumes expect battery electric vehicles to comprise a clear majority of the EV sales mix.
The strong EV demand growth in 2022 was driven by automakers’ increased product offering, increased consumer awareness and adoption, national and regional governments' announced incentives, subsidies and more stringent fuel economy/carbon dioxide emissions regulations to support electrification efforts. Throughout 2022, numerous automakers announced large investments towards drivetrain electrification and laid out roadmaps for launching a growing number of competitive models across various segments and increasing targets for share of EV sales in their overall unit sales.
In 2023 and beyond, fuel economy/carbon dioxide emissions regulations for commercial vehicles coupled with environmental commitments of an increasing number of corporations are likely to propel electric commercial vehicle sales. According to BloombergNEF's June 2022 Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, under the ETS, electric commercial vehicles (battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and range extender electric light-, medium-, heavy-duty commercial vehicles) sales are expected to increase from approximately 0.9 million units in 2020 to approximately 6 million units in 2030, and to approximately 15 million units in 2040. By 2040, according to BloombergNEF, electric light-duty commercial vehicles will have 61% share of all light-duty commercial vehicles sold, electric medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles will have 35% share of all medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles sold. Additionally, BloombergNEF estimate electric buses to have 83% share of all bus sales in 2040.
Besides electrification of transportation, electricity generation continued its decarbonization trend with solar and wind installations crossing new milestones; many of these commercial-, retail- and utility-scale installations are coupled with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage systems. 
In line with varying consumer preferences across regions, automakers are launching an increasing number of EVs across segments and for shorter-ranges and longer-ranges. Automakers have been introducing longer-range, bigger size, premium-performance-luxury EV models using higher energy density batteries and are increasingly doing so by using high (>60%) nickel content cathode materials. Continued strong demand for high nickel content cathode materials for automotive applications will require battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the production of cathode materials. Additionally, since late 2020, automakers have been increasing adoption of lithium iron phosphate cathode material initially for the China passenger vehicles market and subsequently for markets outside China. Lithium iron phosphate is predominantly synthesized using lithium carbonate, and thereby lithium carbonate demand has been witnessing strong growth.
As an existing, proven global producer of battery-grade lithium hydroxide, and lithium carbonate, we are well positioned to benefit from this expected increase in lithium demand from EV growth. As one of the pioneers in the lithium industry, we have relationships throughout the lithium-ion battery value chain. Across the battery value chain, product performance requirements have continued to evolve since the first lithium-ion batteries and cathode materials were introduced in the early 1990s. We have developed our application and materials knowledge by working with our customers over time to produce performance lithium compounds which meet evolving customer needs.
Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable lithium products. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles.

Raw Materials
Lithium    
Our primary raw material is lithium, and we obtain the substantial majority of our lithium from our operations in Argentina. We extract lithium from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina, which are believed to be one of the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium, through a proprietary selective adsorption and solar evaporation process. We process the brine into lithium carbonate at our co-located manufacturing facility in Fénix, Argentina and into lithium chloride at our nearby manufacturing facility in Güemes, Argentina. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our Argentine operations produced approximately 17 kMT, 16 kMT and 16 kMT of lithium carbonate, respectively, and approximately 5 kMT, 4 kMT and 5 kMT of lithium chloride, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Base Lithium production of both lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, on a LCE basis, was approximately 20.5 kMT, 18.5 kMT and 19.5 kMT, respectively.
We have also historically purchased a portion of our lithium carbonate raw materials from other suppliers as needed.
Salar del Hombre Muerto    
We conduct our Argentine operations through Minera del Altiplano SA ("MdA"), our local operating subsidiary. More information on MdA and the Salar del Hombre Muerto mining property may be found under Item 2., Mineral Properties.
Mineral concession rights
MdA holds title to mineral concession rights for its extraction activities in Salar del Hombre Muerto. More information on these mineral concession rights may be found under Item 2., Mineral Properties. 
Water 
Our Argentine operations require fresh water. We have water rights and all necessary permits for the supply of fresh water for our existing operations from the Trapiche aquifer, from which water is pumped through a battery of wells to our facilities. For our capacity expansion, we have secured water rights for the supply of fresh water from the Los Patos aquifer. We are not yet drawing water from the Los Patos aquifer. We have secured the necessary permits for the current phases of our expansion, and will apply for the necessary permits for future phases of our expansion when needed. We and the Catamarca province regularly monitor the water and salinity levels of the Trapiche aquifer.

We only had to temporarily suspend water extraction once, in January 2015, due to a dispute with the Catamarca province, and our access to our water source was quickly restored. We also regularly evaluate supplemental supplies of fresh water. The grant of water concessions and other water rights is subject to local governmental approvals, the timing and availability of which are uncertain and may be subject to delay or denial.
In October 2015, MdA entered into a water trust agreement with the Catamarca province that was amended in 2018. Under the amended trust agreement, MdA is obligated to pay into the trust an amount equal to 1.2% of its annual sales (calculated using the annual Contractual Price described under Item 2., Mineral Properties), in lieu of any water use fees. These payments are fully reflected in our financial statements.
Energy 
Our Argentine operations rely on a steady source of energy. In 2015, we completed construction of a 135 kilometer natural gas pipeline from Pocitos, within the Salta province, to our Fénix facilities at Salar del Hombre Muerto, which eliminated our reliance on natural gas shipments by truck. This pipeline is governed by various agreements between MdA and Recursos Energeticos y Mineros Salta, S.A., or ("REMSA"), a local natural gas sub-distributor, including a subdistribution agreement providing for contracted capacity through 2027. We are in discussions to increase our contracted capacity in advance of our needs for all phases of our expansion plans and may need to invest in additional infrastructure to support this expansion. REMSA or Gasnor S.A., another local natural gas distributor that operates in the northeast of Argentina, have no obligation to provide us the additional capacity on a timely basis or at all. If we cannot obtain such additional capacity, we would need to secure alternative arrangements to meet the increased energy needs of the planned expansion and such alternative arrangements may be less cost effective.
We are financing the construction of two gas compression plants to be built along the natural gas pipeline. One plant is being jointly financed with two other parties, and will be subject to joint control and management. The other plant is being solely financed by, and will be solely controlled and managed by, MdA.
MdA also has a natural gas supply contract with Pluspetrol S.A. providing for the supply of natural gas for our Fénix manufacturing facility. This supply agreement expires in April 2023 and is typically renewed on an annual basis. We also have a purchase agreement with YPF SA for the supply of diesel fuel and gasoline to our Fénix and Güemes manufacturing facilities. This purchase agreement expires in February 2024.
Other raw materials
We purchase raw materials and chemical intermediates for use in our production processes, including materials for use in our production of the proprietary adsorbent used to selectively extract lithium from our brine in Argentina, soda ash, or sodium carbonate, for use in our production of lithium carbonate, and lithium metal for our production of butyllithium. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, costs of major raw materials represented 18%, 14% and 13% of our total revenues, respectively. Major raw materials include soda ash, solvents, butyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, quicklime, metal and caustic soda. We generally satisfy our requirements through spot purchases and medium- or long-term contractual relationships. In general, where we have limited sources of raw materials, we have developed contingency plans to minimize the effect of any interruption or reduction in supply, such as sourcing from other suppliers or maintaining safety stocks. Supply chain constraints arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to remain a challenge in all countries where we operate. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID-19 Impacts."
Temporary shortages of raw materials may occasionally occur and cause temporary price increases. For example, we have had past regional interruptions in raw material supply, notably in China. In recent years, these shortages have not resulted in any material unavailability of raw materials. However, the continuing availability and price of raw materials are affected by many factors, including domestic and world market and political conditions, as well as the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulations. During periods of high demand, our raw materials are subject to significant price fluctuations, and such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, there could be inflationary pressure on costs of the raw materials and/or services that could impact our results of operations. The impact of any future raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions, including China, or in specific business lines cannot be accurately predicted. In line with recent market developments, we have seen price increases in butyllithium raw materials, especially solvents, butyl chloride and lithium metal. We have also seen significant price increases for certain of our raw materials as a result of recent global inflationary pressures. 
Seasonality
Our operations in Argentina are seasonally impacted by weather, including varying evaporation rates and amounts of rainfall during different seasons, which can be heavy at times. These changes impact the concentration in large evaporation ponds and can have an impact on the downstream processes to produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride. Heavy rainfall can damage pond liners, lead to loss of product, and make the ponds generally difficult to maintain. Our operations team continuously measures pond concentrations and models how they will change based on operating decisions. Our processes use proprietary 

and traditional technologies to minimize the variation of concentrations at the inlet to our plants. There was an abnormally large rain event during the last quarter of 2021. This resulted in reductions in lithium carbonate production of approximately 500 MT in 2021.
Argentine Law and Regulation
We are subject to various regulatory requirements in Argentina under the Argentine Mining Code, the Argentine Mining Investment Law and certain federal and provincial regulations, including with respect to environmental compliance. In addition, the relationship between us, MdA and the Catamarca provincial government is regulated through a contractual framework.
The Argentine Mining Code, which sets forth the rights and obligations of both mining companies and their workers, is the principal regulatory framework under which we conduct our operations in Argentina. The Argentine Mining Code provides for the terms under which the provinces regulate and administer the granting of mining rights to third parties.
The Argentine Mining Code establishes two basic means of granting title to mining property: the exploration permit and the mining concession, both of which convey valid mining title in Argentina.
Exploration permits grant their holders the right to freely explore for minerals within the boundaries of the territory covered by that permit as well as to request the mining concession for any discoveries within the covered territory.
Once a mining concession is granted, the recipient owns all in-place mineral deposits within the boundaries of the territory covered by the concession. Mining concessions are freely tradable by the title holder and can be sold, leased or otherwise transferred to third parties. Two requirements must be met to keep a mining concession in good standing: (i) the concession holder must make regular payments of a semi-annual fee known as a canon; and (ii) the concession holder must file and perform an initial five-year expenditure plan. In addition, prior to commencing mining activities, the concession holder must submit environmental impact studies, which must be renewed at least every two years, for approval by the relevant environmental authorities.
In addition to the Argentine Mining Code, we are also subject to the Argentine Mining Investment Law. The Argentine Mining Investment Law offers specific financial incentives to mining investors, including a 30-year term fiscal stability of national, provincial and municipal tax rates; a deduction from income tax for prospecting, exploration and feasibility study expenditures; a refund of Value Added Tax fiscal credits resulting from exploration works; accelerated depreciation of fixed assets; and a 3% cap on royalties payable out of production to the province where the deposit is located. Our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate expires in 2026.
Our fiscal stability rights under the Argentine Mining Investment Law have been challenged by the imposition of certain export taxes on our lithium chloride and carbonate exports that did not exist at the time we obtained our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate. For instance, in 2018, the Federal Government imposed an export duty on lithium carbonate and chloride through Decree No. 793/2018, which was in effect until December 31, 2020. In December 2019, after the change of Presidential administration, the Argentine Congress passed Law No. 27,541 creating a new legal framework for export duties and establishing a new rate for mining and hydrocarbon exports not to exceed 8% on the taxable amounts or the FOB value. In December 2020, the Executive Power issued Decree No. 1060/2020 establishing a new export duty applicable to all kinds of goods effective from January 1, 2021. In the case of lithium chloride and lithium carbonate, the applicable tax rate amounts to 4.5% and no cap has been set. In 2022, Argentine authorities established a reference price for exports of certain grades of lithium carbonate, with any exports below this price being subject to investigation by Customs authorities and the possible payment of higher export duties and corporate taxes. To date, this has not impacted our operations or finances. Separately, in January, 2023, the Argentina Ministry of Economy issued a resolution to cancel an export rebate regime relating to lithium products, which was followed by Presidential Decree No. 57/2023 in February, 2023. The Presidential Decree prospectively cancels all export rebates for lithium products.
Under our 30-year term fiscal stability certificate, we are entitled to reimbursement or set-off (against other federal taxes) of any amount paid in excess of the total federal taxable burden applicable to us under such certificate. Although we are litigating to exercise our fiscal stability rights and are requesting an administrative reimbursement with respect to the imposition of certain of such export taxes, there can be no assurance that we will seek, or be able to obtain, reimbursement or set-off.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to and incur capital and operating costs to comply with numerous foreign, U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing employee health and safety, the composition of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the usage and availability of water, the cleanup of contaminated properties and the reclamation of our mines, brine extraction operations and certain other assets at the end of their useful life.
Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file 

comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Currently, certain lithium products are undergoing a risk assessment review under REACH, which may eventually result in restrictions in the handling or use of lithium carbonate and other lithium products that we produce, which may increase our production costs. In addition, REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities and costs on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. South Korea has a similar Act on the Registration and Evaluation of Chemicals which is known as "K-REACH." Both REACH and K-REACH may lead to increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell in the European Union and South Korea, respectively. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand. In addition, customers may seek products that are not regulated by REACH and/or K-REACH, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the respective regulations. We continually monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.
In June 2016, modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act in the U.S. were signed into law, requiring chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. Other initiatives in Asia and potentially in other regions will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products.
Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances and wastes, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally. Such liabilities may be imposed on entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and wastes, entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances and wastes at the affected property, and entities that currently own or operate such property. Our Bessemer City, North Carolina facility is currently undergoing monitoring and remediation of contamination pursuant to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B corrective action permit. In addition, we currently have, and may in the future incur, liability as a potentially responsible party with respect to third party locations under CERCLA or state and foreign equivalents, including potential joint and several liabilities requiring us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs.
We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims and substantial liability for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of production, pollution and other environmental damages relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents, it is possible that the Company’s revenues, operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators could be impaired.
We record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and orders of regulatory agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future.
A discussion of environmental related factors and related reserves can be found in Note 9 "Environmental Obligations" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Management
Human Capital Management ("HCM") General Statement
At Livent, we are focused on strengthening our position as a global leader in the lithium industry – from both an operational and human capital perspective. Since our formation as a standalone company in 2018, investing in our employees has been a top priority. In 2022, the increased demand for lithium to support the growth of the EV and energy storage markets affected our business in three significant ways: (i) it drove our completion timelines for critical expansion efforts in the U.S. and Argentina to meet increased market demands, (ii) it highlighted the need for us to identify talent with the technical skills and experience needed to meet the shifting demands of our customers and the industry and (iii) it reminded us that we must be ready to support our employees’ continued development and career goals in a space that continues to evolve. The importance we place on relationships between and among us, our customers and our employees is evidenced in the ways we have reviewed and 

modified many of our human capital processes and programs, all of which highlight our emphasis on retaining talent and being an employer of choice within this dynamic industry. 
In 2022, we experienced a 21.4% global headcount increase over the previous year. This increase was driven by several factors, including: (i) our ongoing lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate expansion efforts in the U.S. and Argentina and (ii) a focus on career development and retention which resulted in an average overall turnover rate of 10.3%. Our demand for talent was significantly higher than the previous year. Like many companies, we have faced challenging market factors impacting our ability to attract talent including strong competition among employers, and increased work flexibility and compensation expectations among job seekers. 
As our workforce has grown, so have the needs to support the continued growth and development of our employees at all career levels. In 2021, we developed a talent management strategy focused primarily around understanding and supporting the learning and development needs of our employees. In 2022, we broadened that focus to a full life-cycle talent management approach from hire to retire. This expanded focus was in direct response to feedback we received from our employees in 2022 on how we could improve their overall career experience. Retaining talent will continue to be a top priority for us going forward. 
Finally, the health and safety of our employees continues to drive us in all decision-making aspects of our business. We value the physical, mental and emotional health of our employees and their families and continue to build on the successful support provided to our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to make these support systems available while also addressing the physical safety of our workforce, particularly our manufacturing employees.
The Executive Leadership Team ("ELT") and Board of Directors ("Board") have challenged our teams to advance their focus on (i) identifying and developing high-potential talent with experience in lithium extraction chemical processing and electric vehicle supply chain issues, (ii) global talent retention efforts, (iii) increasing our hiring of diverse talent and women where they are underrepresented, and (iv) creating an even more inclusive workplace. We are working to meet these challenges while maintaining our commitment to our customers, our employees, and the communities in which we operate, while being guided by our core values:
•Safety First. We put safety at the forefront of everything we do. Simply put: the safety of everyone is everyone's responsibility.
•Be Responsible. We act ethically and honestly and advance responsible and sustainable practices in all aspects of our business.
•Constantly Innovate. We move the world forward and strive to constantly innovate through agile thinking, our industry-leading material science expertise, and an intimate understanding of our core element: lithium.
•Celebrate Differences. We celebrate our differences in perspective, background, and expertise, empowering our employees to be authentic and transparent. By encouraging employees to bring their full selves to work, we make Livent more dynamic.
•Thrive with Customers. Customers are at the heart of everything we do. By listening to and learning from them, we work together to build better lithium technologies.
Board of Directors’ Oversight of the HCM Process 
Our Compensation and Organization Committee ("Compensation Committee") assists the Board in its oversight of the development, implementation and effectiveness of our policies and strategies relating to our human capital management function, including, but not limited to, those policies and strategies regarding corporate culture, talent acquisition and retention, pay equity, career development and employment practices. The Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors assists the Board in its oversight of our Corporate Social Responsibility programs, including those relating to community, health and safety, human rights, responsible supply chain, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion ("DE&I"). In 2022, we continued to provide the Board, Sustainability Committee and Compensation Committee with an HCM dashboard designed to help them make informed decisions impacting all areas of HCM. 
Employee Safety, Health, and Wellbeing
Safety remains a core value of our business and drives our focus in everything we do. We continue to publish weekly "safety, quality, sustainability and reliability" messages reminding employees to prioritize safe behaviors in their personal and professional lives. As a manufacturer with numerous ISO certifications, we have established Environmental, Health and Safety management systems that require us to comply with established standards to maintain our certifications. Through these systems we engage our employees, suppliers, customers, and key stakeholders to identify and mitigate risks to drive continual improvement in our safety, health, and environmental performance. Globally, we reported two recordable injuries in 2022. 
Although 2022 marked the easing of COVID-19 restrictions (with China being the last to do so) and a gradual return to "normalcy", our managers and ELT encouraged us to continue providing programs to support our employees’ mental and 

emotional wellbeing. We launched our second global mental health campaign in June 2022 in which we focused on four (4) pillars of mental health: stress management, sleep, nutrition, and physical activity. This 4-month program included a town-hall led by a panel of health and nutrition experts and, as we closed out the campaign, a celebration on World Health Day where we invited employees across the globe to share their insights around the day’s theme of "Our Planet, Our Health". 
Finally, we assessed the risks and benefits of maintaining a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all new U.S. employees and, at the end of 2022, decided to discontinue this policy. Employees whose roles require international travel must meet all current international COVID requirements in effect at the time of travel. We will continue monitoring our office work arrangements, vaccination policy, as well as state and local regulations to ensure the ongoing health and safety of our employees while re-engaging our teams. 
We have made no changes to our vaccine protocols for non-U.S. locations. We will continue to monitor changes in the spread of the virus in these regions and will make any necessary adjustments subject to legally recognized exemptions. 
Workforce Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We continue to operate in the U.S., Asia, Europe and Argentina. As of December 31, 2022, we had a combined workforce of approximately 1,350 full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees. Argentina remains our only location with a unionized workforce, with approximately 236 of our 538 employees being union members. The following represents our employee breakdowns by region: North America (34%); Latin America (49%); Europe (6%); and Asia (11%). Our global gender makeup is approximately 75% male, 24% female, and 1% unspecified. The gender composition of our senior leadership team is 45% female and 55% male, and our Board composition is 25% female and 75% male. 
Racial diversity metrics continue to only be tracked in the U.S. To maintain our focus on hiring more diverse talent in the U.S., we invested in partnerships with engineering, diversity recruitment and veterans’ organizations to specifically target certain talent pools for a variety of roles. As of December 31, 2022, the breakdown of the racial diversity amongst our U.S. employees is as follows: 

2022 v. 2021* U.S. Diversity
Asian | Black/African American | Hispanic | Two or More Races | Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander*** | White | Unspecified 
8% (+2%) | 22% (+2%) | 3% (+1%) | 1%** | <1% | 60% (-6%) | 5% (no change)

* # in parentheses indicates % change compared to 2021 data
** Was <1% in 2021
*** This is a new reportable category in the U.S. in 2022
For our U.S. population, we completed a rigorous pay equity analysis with a leading third party to determine if there was any bias in compensation linked to gender or race/ethnicity. Results from the statistical analysis, consistent with methods used by the U.S. Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, did not reveal any overall systemic gender or racial based pay gaps in terms of base pay and total cash. 
Early talent development continues to play a pivotal part in our overall recruitment strategy. In contrast to prior years, in 2022, we broadened our reach to attract college-level talent in the U.S. resulting in hiring a total of 12 students from a variety of colleges and universities to serve in internship roles across all functions (a number of whom were invited to work beyond their original term). Combined with apprenticeship programs in the U.K., Argentina, and Asia, we continue to attract and hire local and Indigenous resident populations where we operate. In 2022, we hired approximately 37 temporary and full-time employees across all three programs, of which 30% were female, 40% were male and 30% were unspecified.
Global DE&I training remains a focus for the organization and through partnership with one of our external training consultants, we facilitated training for several U.S.-based managers. Additional training sessions will be offered in 2023 both in partnership with external facilitators as well as through our new learning management system ("LMS") launching in 2023. Finally, in September 2022, our DE&I Committee launched a global newsletter series to share DE&I principles and give all employees an opportunity to learn and be exposed to different perspectives.
In 2022, our Employee Resource Groups ("ERG") continued to deliver programming designed to advance their missions and broaden the perspectives of Livent employees globally. These programs highlighted the maturation of each of these groups and their efforts to go beyond just heightening awareness to impacting recruiting, community outreach and mentoring. Each ERG was also assigned new executive sponsors to assist them with advancing their ideas through counsel and allyship so that they could become more impactful to the organization and the communities in which we operate. Our DE&I Committee, chaired by 

our Chief Human Resources Officer, continues to challenge our ERGs to consider ways in which they can impact Livent’s culture and live its core value to Celebrate Differences. In 2023, we have adopted a global DE&I theme of "Growing an Inclusive Work Environment" and have encouraged our ERGs to sponsor programming in support of this theme. We will continue working with our ERGs to review and support their initiatives while also extending the global reach of our programming. 

ERG | Year Formed | Mission | 2022 Highlights 
Black Employee Network | 2020 | To provide a safe space for the Black community at work to ensure Livent is inclusive at all professional levels. | •Quarterly meetings with Black Employee Network members and allies focused on addressing and raising awareness around relevant topics impacting our work and local communities

Talent Development & Management
We continue to see increased demands for lithium drive an unprecedented need for skilled talent in the markets in which we operate. This increased demand highlights the importance of providing continuous learning and development for our growing workforce as part of our overall talent retention and succession planning strategy. Our 2022 manufacturing expansion efforts challenged our ability to balance meeting hiring goals while leveraging available talent in our markets which, in some regions, meant relying on training to upskill workers to meet the needs of our business. In 2022, we filled approximately 335 jobs across all functions (approximately 71% external/29% internal). Our 2022 voluntary turnover rate was 7.6% which represents a decrease of 0.1% from the prior year. 
Globally, in 2022 we experienced a continuation of 2021’s talent acquisition challenges, specifically, steady market competition for talent driven by demanding compensation packages and desires for flexible/remote work arrangements for certain non-manufacturing roles. 
In advancing our learning and development strategy, we adopted a new set of core competencies which better reflect the behaviors required for success in our growing and rapidly changing industry. We have challenged our managers to become versed in these competencies and use them to drive outcomes in performance management discussions with their employees. To support managers’ adoption of these competencies, we facilitated live trainings as well as produced a series of training videos for their use and reference during our year-end performance management and goal-setting processes. We ended 2022 finalizing plans for the launch of our LMS system. This LMS will play an important role in supporting our employees’ growth and development and allow the organization to implement important succession planning steps for key roles. 
Compensation, Pay Equity & Benefits 
We recognize the importance of maintaining competitive compensation and benefits programs to be able to attract and retain the talent needed to meet the demands of our evolving business and industry as well as meet the needs of all our employees. We consistently review pay actions to ensure we maintain pay equity across the organization, and we intend to conduct another pay equity review in 2023. In 2022, we continued to build upon improvements made to our compensation and benefits program. Our updated compensation structure considers information received from local market data as well as external consultants. It remains comprised of base salaries, short and long-term incentive structures (based on job level), retention and recognition grants, and individual and business performance-based incentives. To support our managers’ adoption of the updated compensation structure, we delivered compensation training sessions and developed a manager toolkit containing compensation and performance management guidelines for their reference in making informed compensation decisions. 
Each year we evaluate our global benefits offerings (which vary by country/region and employment classification) to offer enhancements that are responsive to the needs of our employees while balancing the costs to be borne by the organization and our employees. Our U.S. benefits include tax-deferred savings programs; medical, prescription drug, vision, and dental insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; life and accident insurance; short and long-term disability insurance; 

an employee assistance program; paid time off; family leave; and wellness incentives. We continue to monitor costs year-over-year and make efforts to negotiate benefits packages that are affordable to all eligible employees. For the 2022 plan year, we offered reduced premiums based on COVID-19 vaccination status; this program was eliminated in 2023. No other material changes were made to our U.S. benefits in 2022. In 2023, we will implement a more robust mental health benefit in the U.S. to replace our existing Employee Assistance Program which will offer an enhanced diverse network of providers tailored to the specific needs of our employees and their dependents. 
Across all our regional locations, we continued to promote a variety of health and wellness programs aimed at heightening awareness around mental health, COVID-19 prevention and maintaining healthy, active lifestyles for our employees and their families. 
Advancing Employee Engagement & Positive Workplace Culture 
Our 2021 global employee engagement survey highlighted Teamwork, Work Environment and Beliefs and Attitudes (relative to creating an inclusive environment) as our most favorable categories. The three areas our team chose to focus on in 2022 were Manager Engagement, Career Experience, and Decision Making, Communication and Change Management. We formed a global, cross-functional action planning team to recommend and implement actions in direct response to the feedback we received from our employees. As a result, our global action planning team has laid the foundation for a variety of actions.
Additionally, to ensure responsiveness to the survey feedback at each of our manufacturing sites, we challenged our site leaders to implement any necessary actions they deemed appropriate as part of this process. Each location has implemented site-level action plans and will continue to review and measure their results in 2023. We will launch our second global employee engagement survey in Q3 2023 to measure our efforts against the 2022 enterprise-wide action plan. 
Social Responsibility
We remain committed to strong corporate social responsibility ("CSR") principles and incorporate them into all aspects of our business, tracking their impact in the communities in which we operate. Our CSR focus includes occupational health and safety; employee experience, engagement, and development; DE&I; community involvement and development; environmental actions; and human rights. 
Supply Chain Human Capital Management Safeguards 
We are committed to the objective of ensuring there is no modern slavery in our supply chains or in our business. Through our Human Rights Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Supplier Sustainability Policy and other internal policies, our supply chain initiatives and screening processes, and employee training, we are committed to sourcing components and materials from companies that share our values regarding respect for human rights, integrity, and environmental responsibility. We will continue to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to prevent modern slavery in our supply chains.
Sustainability & Environmental Priorities
Sustainability is a top priority for Livent. Underpinning our expansion efforts in the U.S., Argentina and around the world is our commitment to expanding lithium production in a sustainable and responsible way, to minimize impacts to the environment and benefit the communities in which we operate. 2022 marked the third consecutive year that Livent achieved a Gold sustainability rating from EcoVadis, placing Livent in the top 5% of the more than 90,000 companies assessed by EcoVadis around the world. EcoVadis assesses sustainability performance across four main categories: Environment, Labor & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. Also in 2022, Livent was placed in the highest tier of sustainable lithium producers in the inaugural ESG Report from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Recognition from leading industry raters and rankers highlights Livent’s leading sustainability profile and the progress we have continued to make on a number of fronts as we work to deliver on our 2030 and 2040 sustainability commitments. As one of the first lithium producers in the world to become a full member of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance ("IRMA"), we are leading by example in our industry and helping to drive an agenda for increased transparency, stakeholder engagement and responsible growth. In late December 2022, Livent completed the next stage of the IRMA process by completing a voluntary and comprehensive onsite assessment of our Fenix operations in Argentina. We also reached key milestones in our voluntary collaboration in the multi-year sustainable water study sponsored by BMW Group and BASF which was led by U.S.-based research teams from University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Each year, we publish a Sustainability Report, a copy of which can be found in the section captioned "Sustainability & Community" on our website at www.livent.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Community Involvement & Development 
We believe our success is dependent upon the trust and partnership we build with our local communities. We encourage our employees globally to become sound corporate citizens and engage in community outreach in the regions in which we operate. We support our communities around the world through a range of activities, including philanthropic giving, employee 

volunteerism, infrastructure development and local capacity building. Community engagement activities across Livent focus on promoting safety, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education, health and nutrition and poverty alleviation. Globally, each Livent facility runs its own community engagement activities based on employee understanding of local needs. Additional information regarding our community outreach efforts can be found in the section captioned "Sustainability & Community" on our website at www.livent.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
We are governed by a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all directors, officers (including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller), employees, suppliers, and contractors in their work on behalf of Livent. See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance, for more information about our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.
