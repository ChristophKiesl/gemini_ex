Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2021 and were formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and assets consisting almost entirely of investments held in the trust account. 
 We have not selected any specific business combination target. Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination, we intend to concentrate on sourcing business combination opportunities in industry sectors that are being fundamentally reshaped by the introduction of advanced technologies, such as robotics, automation and artificial intelligence (“RAAI”), commonly referred to as “Industry 4.0.” In addition to RAAI, which we expect will be a key theme and focus as we source business combination opportunities, we plan to also utilize the experience and relationship networks of our management team and board of directors to identify and source attractive and high growth opportunities in the environmental, social and governance, and specifically, the sustainability arena. We believe that companies in these sectors that are using advanced data analytics, software, artificial intelligence, and cutting-edge instrumentation and process automation to make their processes “intelligent” have a significant competitive advantage over those that have not yet embraced these solutions. We expect our focus on Industry 4.0, RAAI, and sustainability will be concentrated in various sub-verticals, such as robotics; artificial intelligence; mobility tech/autonomy; data management & analytics; augmented reality/virtual reality; manufacturing and operations automation; IoT; blockchain; DNA sequencing; energy storage; energy efficiency and decarbonization; renewable energy; energy and environmental/climate technology; smart grid/smart city; agriculture and food technology/innovation, recycling and remediation, advanced materials, and water and bioresources. 
 Our sponsor is Cascadia Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). On February 22, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 4,312,500 shares of Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”), of which 562,500 shares were forfeited in October 2021 in connection with the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. Prior to the closing of our Initial Public Offering, our Sponsor transferred 25,000 Founder Shares to each of our three independent directors and sold an aggregate of 937,500 Founder Shares to 12 qualified institutional buyers or institutional accredited investors that are not affiliated with us, our Sponsor, our directors or any member of our management, which we refer to as anchor investors. Each anchor investor agreed to (a) vote any Founder Shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination and (b) subject any Founder Shares held by them to the same lock-up restrictions as the Founder Shares held by our Sponsor and independent directors. 
 Initial Public Offering 
 The registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on August 25, 2021. On August 30, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 15,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000, and incurring offering costs of $8,830,225 of which $5,250,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. We granted 
 
1 

  the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. On October 9, 2021, the underwriter’s over-allotment option expired unexercised. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated a private placement with our Sponsor of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $5,000,000 (the “Private Placement”). Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. 
 Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 30, 2021, an amount equal to $150,000,000, or $10.00 per Unit, from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. If we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). 
 The outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with a business combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion, including the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and build a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from its strategic and operational expertise. After our initial business combination, we envision our strategy may include additional mergers and acquisitions and the application of new technologies and/or other operational improvements with a focus on generating attractive long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders. We will leverage our management team’s and Cascadia Capital’s network of potential transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience could catalyze a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to enhance their overall value. We also may benefit from our engagement of Cascadia Capital, LLC as a financial advisor on our business combinations and other transactions. 
Investment Criteria 
 Based on our management’s experience, we have developed the following non-exclusive investment criteria that we will use to screen for and evaluate prospective target businesses. 
 
2 

 
• | Companies that operate in industries and sectors that are ripe for technological disruption or are currently undergoing technological transformations. We plan to identify industries and sectors that are in the process of, or have significant potential to benefit from and adopt, an Industry 4.0 solution, and seek to acquire businesses that are well positioned to capitalize on this trend, which we believe is driving high growth opportunities in sectors that align well with our experience and expertise, such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (RAAI) and ESG (Sustainability).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies with an attractive and defensible competitive position. We intend to target companies with market positions and technologies that we believe offer long-term competitive advantages. These could include proprietary technology, a market leading product suite, unique processes, strong market share, or a culture of innovation that we believe is enduring and unique.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clear Benefit from a Business Combination with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company. We intend to seek a business that has a clear use of proceeds and a clear catalyst or inflection point resulting from our capital, team, public listing, roll-up synergies, deleveraging and/or re-rating milestones expected to propel the business through our structural dilution in the near term with enhanced financial results, margins, market position and stockholder value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tangible Benefit from our Capabilities. We intend to seek a business where the collective capabilities of our management and sponsor, and any operating partners we involve, can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary and/or High Conviction Transactions. We intend to leverage our business network to source our initial business combination on a proprietary basis, if possible. However, we will utilize our collective experience and insight to strategically consider participating in formal processes focused primarily on narrowing a pool of special purpose acquisition companies to a single winning bidder in instances where we believe we are optimally-positioned to win such processes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Committed and Capable Management Team. We plan to seek a business with a management team whose interests are aligned with our strategic focus and who can clearly and confidently articulate the business plan and market opportunities to public market investors. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target business’s management team and their board of directors by recruiting additional talent through our network of contacts or otherwise. This may include recruiting experienced industry professionals, or operating partners, to assist in our evaluation of the opportunity and marketing of the business combination prior to its completion, who may assume an ongoing role with the business or board thereafter.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to Grow, including Through Further Acquisition Opportunities. We intend to seek a business that has the potential to grow organically and inorganically through additional acquisitions, with management having identified a pipeline of potentially actionable accretive acquisitions. We expect to work with the ongoing management team to develop the business strategy around geographic expansion, new products, high-return capital expenditure projects and acquisitions, as well as creating and maintaining the optimal capital structure for growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preparedness for the Process and Public Markets. We plan to seek a business that has, or can put in place prior to the closing of a business combination, the governance, financial systems and controls required in the public markets. Specifically, we will seek to avoid situations where extensive accounting or restructuring work is required with an uncertain timetable or outcome before a transaction can be completed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the Initial Public Offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of 65% of our common stock. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficially own approximately 20% of our common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

• | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the requirements of other applicable law;

• | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on our initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions;

• | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or our executive officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. Whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

 Employees 
 We currently have one executive officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Website 
 Our website address is https://www.cascadiaacquisitioncorp.com. Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to these reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Alternatively, you may access these reports at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our Units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to stockholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to, GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

 We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
