   ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS

 
  The following section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally refers to business developments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Discussion of or references to prior period business developments that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 Overview
  Blue Dolphin is an independent downstream energy company operating in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Our subsidiaries operate a light sweet-crude, 15,000-bpd crude distillation tower with approximately 1.2 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity in Nixon, Texas. Blue Dolphin was formed in 1986 as a Delaware corporation and is traded on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol “BDCO”.
  
 Our assets are primarily organized in two segments: refinery operations (owned by LE) and tolling and terminaling services (owned by LRM and NPS). Subsidiaries that are reflected in corporate and other include BDPL (inactive pipeline and facilities assets), BDPC (inactive leasehold interests in oil and gas wells), and BDSC (administrative services). For more information related to our business segments and properties, see “Part I. Item 1. Business—Refinery Operations, —Tolling and Terminaling Operations, and —Inactive Operations” and “Part I. Item 2. Properties” in this report.
  
  Affiliates
  Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report. An Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties and funds working capital requirements during periods of working capital deficits, and an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products. Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries are currently parties to a variety of agreements with Affiliates. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note (3)” for additional disclosures related to Affiliate agreements, arrangements, and risks associated with working capital deficits.
 Going Concern
   Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed more fully below, these factors include inadequate liquidity to sustain operations due to defaults under our secured loan agreements, margin deterioration and volatility, and historic net losses and working capital deficits. Our consolidated financial statements assume we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on sustained positive operating margins and having working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on long-term debt. Without positive operating margins and working capital, our business will be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue. If we are unable to make required debt payments, we would likely have to consider other options, such as selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs or otherwise reducing our cash requirements, or negotiating with our creditors to restructure our applicable obligations, including a potential bankruptcy filing.
  
  Defaults Under Secured Loan Agreements. We are currently in default under certain of our secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties. As a result, the debt associated with these obligations was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes (1), (3), (10), and (11)” for additional disclosures related to third-party and related-party debt, defaults on such debt, and the potential effects of such defaults on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
  
  Third-Party Defaults
    ●
 Veritex Loans – Defaults under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 permit Veritex to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Any exercise by Veritex of its rights and remedies under our secured loan agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations. Veritex exercising its rights would also adversely impact the trading price of our common stock and the value of an investment in our common stock, which could lead to holders of our common stock losing their investment in its entirety. We can provide no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our secured loan agreements with Veritex, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) LE and LRM will be able to refinance or restructure the payments of the debt, and/or (iii) Veritex, as first lien holder, will provide future default waivers. The borrowers continue in active dialogue with Veritex. As of the filing date of this report, payments under the Veritex loans were current, but other defaults remained outstanding.

 Amended Pilot Line of Credit – Upon maturity of the Pilot Line of Credit in May 2020, Pilot sent NPS, as borrower, and LRM, LEH, LE and Blue Dolphin, each a guarantor and collectively guarantors, a notice demanding the immediate payment of the unpaid principal amount and all interest accrued and unpaid, and all other amounts owing or payable (the “Obligations”). Pursuant to the Amended Pilot Line of Credit, commencing on May 4, 2020, the Obligations began to accrue interest at a default rate of fourteen percent (14%) per annum. Failure of the borrower or any guarantor of paying the past due Obligations constituted an event of default. Pilot expressly retained and reserved all its rights and remedies available to it at any time, including without limitation, the right to exercise all rights and remedies available to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit or applicable law or equity.

 
 Pursuant to a June 1, 2020 notice, Pilot began applying Pilot’s payment obligations to NPS under each of (a) the Terminal Services Agreement (covering Tank Nos. 67, 71, 72, 73, 77, and 78), dated as of May 2019, between NPS and Pilot, and (b) the Terminal Services Agreement (covering Tank No. 56), dated as of June 1, 2019, between NPS and Pilot, against NPS’ payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. Such tank lease setoff amounts only partially satisfy NPS’ obligations under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit, and Pilot expressly retained and reserved all its rights and remedies available to it at any time, including, without limitation, the right to exercise all rights and remedies available to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit or applicable law or equity. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the tank lease setoff amounts totaled $1.3 million and $0, respectively. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of interest NPS incurred under the Amended Pilot line of credit totaled $1.0 million and $0, respectively.
  
 On November 23, 2020, NPS and guarantors received notice from Pilot that the entry into the SBA EIDLs was a breach of the Amended Pilot Line of Credit and Pilot demanded full repayment of the Obligations, including through use of the proceeds of the SBA EIDLs. Pilot also notified the SBA that the liens securing the SBA EIDLs are junior to those securing the Obligations. While the SBA acknowledged this point and indicated a willingness to subordinate the SBA EIDLs, no further action has been taken by Pilot as of the filing date of this report.
  
 Any exercise by Pilot of its rights and remedies under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit would have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including crude oil and condensate procurement and our customer relationships; financial condition; and results of operations. NPS and guarantors continue in active dialogue with Pilot to reach a negotiated settlement, and we believe that Pilot hopes to continue working with NPS to settle the Obligations. NPS and guarantors are also working on the possible refinance of amounts owing and payable under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. However, progress with potential lenders has been slow due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. NPS’s ability to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend this credit facility is dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance, and the general condition of the financial markets. Given the current financial markets, we could be forced to undertake alternate financings, including a sale of additional common stock, negotiate for an extension of the maturity, or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay such indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all. If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify. In the event we are unsuccessful in such endeavors, NPS may be unable to pay the amounts outstanding under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit, which may require us to seek protection under bankruptcy laws. In such a case, the trading price of our common stock and the value of an investment in our common stock could significantly decrease, which could lead to holders of our common stock losing their investment in our common stock in its entirety.
  
   ●
 Notre Dame Debt – Pursuant to a 2015 subordination agreement, the holder of the Notre Dame Debt agreed to subordinate their right to payments, as well as any security interest and liens on the Nixon facility’s business assets, in favor of Veritex as holder of the LE Term Loan Due 2034. To date, no payments have been made under the subordinated Notre Dame Debt and the holder of the Notre Dame Debt has taken no action as a result of the non-payment.

 
 Our financial health could be materially and adversely affected by defaults in our secured loan agreements, margin deterioration and volatility, historic net losses and working capital deficits, as well as termination of the crude supply agreement or terminal services agreement with Pilot, which could impact our ability to acquire crude oil and condensate. In addition, sustained periods of low crude oil prices due to market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial constraints on producers, which in turn has resulted in long term crude oil supply constraints and increased transportation costs. A failure to acquire crude oil and condensate when needed will have a material effect on our business results and operations. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, our refinery experienced downtime as a result of lack of crude due to cash constraints.
  
  Related-Party Defaults
  Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report, an Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products, and we borrow from Affiliates during periods of working capital deficits.

  Margin Deterioration and Volatility. Our refining margins generally improve in an environment of higher crude oil and refined product prices, and where the spread between crude oil prices and refined product prices widen. Steps taken early on to address the COVID-19 pandemic globally and nationally, including government-imposed temporary business closures and voluntary shelter-at-home directives, caused oil prices to decline sharply in 2020. In addition, actions by members of the OPEC and other producer countries with respect to oil production and pricing significantly impacted supply and demand in global oil and gas markets. In response to margin deterioration and volatility, we adjust throughput and production at the Nixon refinery based on prevailing market conditions. Although federal, state, and local governments and health officials have made strides to contain the virus, treat its effects, and implement vaccine programs and OPEC has since agreed to certain production cuts, oil prices have remained depressed and oversupply and lack of demand in the market persists. Oil and refined product prices and demand are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict when prices and demand will improve and stabilize. As of the date of this report the Nixon refinery is still operating at reduced throughput levels and we expect it to continue to do so until market conditions substantially improve. We are currently unable to estimate the impact these events will have on our future financial position and results of operations. Accordingly, we expect that these events will continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
  
  Historic Net Losses and Working Capital Deficits.
   Net Losses
  Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was $14.5 million, or a loss of $1.15 per share, compared to net income of $7.4 million, or income of $0.66 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The significant increase in net loss during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was the result of: (1) lower refining margins associated with commodity price volatility, as noted above, and (2) lower throughput volumes and barrels sold. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included a $9.1 million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the GEL Settlement.
 Working Capital Deficits
  We had a working capital deficit of $72.3 million and $59.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $22.9 million and $19.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash (current portion), and restricted cash, noncurrent were as follow:

 | December 31, 
----------------------------------+---------------
 | 2020 | 2019
 | (in thousands)
Cash and cash equivalents | $549 | $72 
Restricted cash (current portion) | 48 | 49 
Restricted cash, noncurrent | 514 | 547 
Total | $1,111 | $668


 
 See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note (1)” regarding going concern factors and associated risks.
  
  Operating Risks
  Successful execution of our business strategy depends on several key factors, including, having adequate working capital to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements, maintaining safe and reliable operations at the Nixon facility, meeting contractual obligations, and having favorable margins on refined products. As discussed under “Part I, Item 1. Business —Going Concern” and throughout this report, we are currently unable to estimate the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future financial position and results of operations. Under earlier state and federal mandates that regulated business closures, our business was deemed as an essential business and, as such, remained open. As U.S. federal, state, and local officials address surging coronavirus cases and roll out COVID-19 vaccines, we expect to continue operating. Governmental mandates, while necessary to address the virus, will result in further business and operational disruptions, including demand destruction, liquidity strains, supply chain challenges, travel restrictions, controls on in-person gathering, and workforce availability.
  
 Despite this, management believes that it has taken all prudent steps to mitigate risk, avoid business disruptions, manage cash flow, and remain competitive in a low oil price environment. We are managing cash flow by optimizing receivables and payables by prioritizing payments, managing inventory to avoid buildup, monitoring discretionary spending, and delaying capital expenditures. At the Nixon facility, we adjust throughput and production based on prevailing market conditions. Facility-dependent personnel, including those needed to maintain the Nixon facility, report to the facility under strict protocols that are designed to ensure personnel health and safety. We are also supporting non-facility-dependent personnel through remote work and virtual meeting technology, and we are encouraging all personnel to follow local guidance. All non-essential business travel and attendance at conferences, trainings, and other gatherings have been suspended.

 There can be no assurance that our business strategy will be successful, that Affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs when we experience working capital deficits, that we will meet regulatory requirements to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) and decommission offshore pipelines and platform assets, that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that margins on our refined products will be favorable. Further, if Veritex and/or Pilot exercise their rights and remedies under our secured loan agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
  
  Refinery Operations
  Our refinery operations segment consists of the following assets and operations:
  
 
Property | Key Products Handled | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+----------------------+-------------
Nixon facility ● Crude distillation tower (15,000 bpd) ● Petroleum storage tanks ● Loading and unloading facilities ● Land (56 acres) | Crude Oil Refined Products | LE | Nixon, Texas


 
  Capital Improvement Expansion Project. During 2020, we safely completed a 5-year capital improvement expansion project of the Nixon facility. The expansion project involved the construction of nearly 1.0 million bbls of new petroleum storage tanks, smaller efficiency improvements to the refinery, and acquisition of refurbished refinery equipment for future deployment. The increase in petroleum storage capacity has helped with de-bottlenecking the Nixon refinery. Additional petroleum storage capacity will allow for increased refinery throughput of up to approximately 30,000 bpd while deployment of various refurbished refinery equipment will help improve processing capacity and increase the Nixon refinery’s complexity. The total cost of the project, which was funded through the Veritex loans, was approximately $32.5 million.
  
  Crude Oil and Condensate Supply.  Operation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. We have a long-term crude supply agreement in place with Pilot. Under the initial term of the crude supply agreement, Pilot will sell us approximately 24.8 million net bbls of crude oil. Thereafter, the crude supply agreement will continue on a one-year evergreen basis. Effective March 1, 2020, Pilot assigned its rights, title, interest, and obligations in the crude supply agreement to Tartan Oil LLC, a Pilot affiliate. Either party may terminate the crude supply agreement by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice. Pilot also stores crude oil at the Nixon facility under two terminal services agreements. Under the terminal services agreements, Pilot stores crude oil at the Nixon facility at a specified rate per bbl of the storage tank’s shell capacity. Although the initial term of the terminal services agreement expired April 30, 2020, the agreement renewed on a one-year evergreen basis. Either party may terminate the terminal services agreement by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice. However, the terminal services agreement will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the crude supply agreement. In addition, sustained periods of low crude oil prices due to market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant financial constraints on producers, which in turn has resulted in long term crude oil supply constraints and increased transportation costs. A failure to acquire crude oil and condensate when needed will have a material effect on our business results and operations. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, our refinery experienced downtime as a result of lack of crude due to cash constraints.
  
  Products and Markets. Our market is the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which is represented by the EIA as Petroleum Administration for PADD 3.  We sell our products primarily in the U.S. within PADD 3. Occasionally, we sell refined products to customers that export to Mexico.
  
 The Nixon refinery’s product slate is moderately adjusted based on market demand. We currently produce a single finished product – jet fuel – and several intermediate products, including naphtha, HOBM, and AGO. Our jet fuel is sold to an Affiliate, which is HUBZone certified. The product sales agreement with the Affiliate has a 1-year term expiring the earliest to occur of March 31, 2022 plus 30-day carryover or delivery of the maximum quantity of jet fuel. Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing.
  
  Customers. Customers for our refined products include distributors, wholesalers and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts in place with most of our customers, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms. Certain of our contracts require our customers to prepay and us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation on a forward-looking basis, which could result in higher or lower relative prices on future sales of our refined products.
  
  Competition. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and are engaged on a national or international level in many segments of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, gathering and transportation, and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined products slate because of changing commodity prices, market demand, and refinery operating costs.

  Safety and Downtime. Our refinery operations are operated in a manner materially consistent with industry safe practices and standards. These operations are subject to regulations under OSHA, the EPA, and comparable state and local requirements. Together, these regulations are designed for personnel safety, process safety management, and risk management, as well as to prevent or minimize the probability and consequences of an accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Storage tanks used for refinery operations are designed for crude oil and condensate and refined products, and most are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our refinery operations have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies.
  
  The Nixon refinery periodically experiences planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. Unplanned shutdowns can occur for a variety of reasons, including voluntary regulatory compliance measures, cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities, disabled equipment, or lack of crude due to cash constraints. However, in Texas the most typical reason is excessive heat or power outages from high winds and thunderstorms. The Nixon refinery did not incur significant damage related to freezing temperatures in February 2021. However, the plant was down for approximately 8 days as a result of lost external power. Planned turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. Refineries typically undergo a major turnaround every three to five years. Since the Nixon refinery was placed back in service in 2012 (commonly referred to as “recommissioning”), turnarounds are needed more frequently for unanticipated maintenance or repairs.
  
  We are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime will result in lost margin opportunity, potential increased maintenance expense, and a reduction of refined products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.
  
  Tolling and Terminaling Operations
  Our tolling and terminaling segment consists of the following assets and operations:
  
 
Property | Key Products Handled | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+----------------------+-------------
Nixon facility ● Petroleum storage tanks ● Loading and unloading facilities | Crude Oil Refined Products | LRM, NPS | Nixon, Texas


 
  Capital Improvement Expansion Project. As previously noted, we completed a 5-year capital improvement expansion project of the Nixon facility during 2020. Tolling and terminaling capital improvements primarily related to construction of new petroleum storage tanks to significantly increase petroleum storage capacity. Increased petroleum storage capacity will provide an opportunity to generate additional tolling and terminaling revenue.
  
  Products and Customers. The Nixon facility’s petroleum storage tanks and infrastructure are primarily suited for crude oil and condensate and refined products, such as naphtha, jet fuel, diesel, and fuel oil. Storage customers are typically refiners in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston – San Antonio – Dallas/Fort Worth area). Shipments are received and redelivered from within the Nixon facility via pipeline or from third parties via truck. Contract terms range from month-to-month to three years.
  
  Operations Safety. Our tolling and terminal operations are operated in a manner materially consistent with industry safe practices and standards. These operations are subject to regulations under OSHA and comparable state and local regulations. Storage tanks used for terminal operations are designed for crude oil and condensate and refined products, and most are equipped with appropriate controls that minimize emissions and promote safety. Our terminal operations have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies.

 Inactive Operations
  We own certain other pipeline and facilities assets and have leasehold interests in oil and gas properties. These assets, which are shown below and included in corporate and other, are not operational and are fully impaired. We fully impaired our pipeline assets in 2016 and our oil and gas leasehold interests in 2011. Our pipeline assets and oil and gas leasehold interests had no revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note (16)” related to pipelines and platform decommissioning requirements and related risks.

Property | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------
Freeport facility ● Crude oil and natural gas separation and dehydration ● Natural gas processing, treating, and redelivery ● Vapor recovery unit ● Two onshore pipelines ● Land (162 acres) | BDPL | Freeport, Texas
Offshore Pipelines (Trunk Line and Lateral Lines) | BDPL | Gulf of Mexico 
Oil and Gas Leasehold Interests | BDPC | Gulf of Mexico 

  Pipeline and Facilities Safety.
  Although our pipeline and facility assets are inactive, they require upkeep and maintenance and are subject to safety regulations under OSHA, PHMSA, BOEM, BSEE, and comparable state and local regulations. We have response and control plans, spill prevention and other programs to respond to emergencies related to these assets.
 Personnel
  We have no employees. We rely on an Affiliate to manage our facilities pursuant to the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. Services under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement include personnel serving in a variety of capacities, including, but not limited to corporate executives, operations and maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and administrative and professional services. At December 31, 2020, the Affiliate had a total of 199 employees, 161 full-time and 38 part-time. No personnel were covered by collective bargaining agreements. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note (3)” for additional disclosures related to Affiliate arrangements.
 Insurance and Risk Management
  Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in crude oil and condensate refining operations, as well as the transportation and storage of crude oil and condensate and refined products. We have property damage and business interruption coverage at the Nixon facility. Business interruption coverage is for 24 months from the date of the loss, subject to a deductible with a 45-day waiting period. Our property damage insurance has deductibles ranging from $5,000 to $500,000. In addition, we have a full suite of insurance policies covering workers’ compensation, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, environmental liability, and other business risks. These coverages are supported by safety and other risk management programs.
 Intellectual Property
  We rely on intellectual property laws to protect our brand, as well as those of our subsidiaries. “Blue Dolphin Energy Company” is a registered trademark in the U.S. in name and logo form. “Petroport, Inc.” is a registered trademark in the U.S. in name form. In addition, “www.blue-dolphin-energy.com” is a registered domain name.

 Government Regulations
   General. Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local laws, regulations, permits, and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern obtaining and maintaining construction and operating permits, the emission and discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air, and water, the handling and disposal of solid, liquid, and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. These requirements may also significantly affect our customers’ operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, we do not expect such effects will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
  
  Air Emissions and Climate Change Regulations.  Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, we are required to obtain permits, as well as test, monitor, report, and implement control requirements. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at the Nixon facility and certain emission sources located offshore, and our ability to secure future permits may become less certain. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs.
  
 The EPA has undertaken significant regulatory initiatives under authority of the Clean Air Act’s NSR/PSD program to further reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These regulatory initiatives have been targeted at industries with large manufacturing facilities that are significant sources of emissions, such as refining, paper and pulp, and electric power generating industries. The basic premise of these initiatives is the EPA’s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with NSR/PSD regulations adopted by the EPA that require permits and new emission controls in connection with any significant facility modifications or expansions that can result in emission increases above certain thresholds. As part of this ongoing NSR/PSD regulatory initiative, the EPA has consent decrees with several refiners that require refiners to make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities. We have not been selected by the EPA to enter a consent decree. If selected, as a small refiner we do not expect any additional requirements to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
  
 The EPA strengthened the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion in 2015 from the 75-parts per billion level set in 2008. To implement the revised ozone NAAQS, all states will need to review their existing air quality management infrastructure State Implementation Plan for ozone and ensure it is appropriate and adequate. Where areas remain in ozone non-attainment, or come into ozone non-attainment as a result of the revised NAAQS, it is likely that additional planning and control obligations will be required. States may impose additional emissions control requirements on stationary sources, changes in fuels specifications, and changes in fuels mix and mobile source emissions controls. The ongoing and potential future requirements imposed by states to meet the ozone NAAQS could have direct impacts on terminaling facilities through additional requirements and increased permitting costs and could have indirect impacts through changing or decreasing fuel demand.
  
 The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 created RFS2 requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. We applied for an extension of the temporary exemption afforded small refineries through December 31, 2010. The EPA granted the Nixon refinery a small refinery exemption from RFS2 requirements for 2013 and 2014. Since 2014, the Nixon refinery has solely produced HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product that does not fall under RFS2.
  
 Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include actions to develop national, state, or regional programs, each of which would require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of our customers. In 2015, the EPA amended the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, to include among other things a new Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment that encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from equipment and sources within the petroleum and natural gas gathering boosting systems. In 2016, the EPA promulgated regulations regarding performance standards for methane emissions from new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, and in September 2018, proposed targeted improvements to these standards to streamline implementation of the rules. These and other legislative regulatory measures will impose additional burdens on our business and those of our customers.
  
  Hazardous Substances and Waste Regulations. The CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liability on a broad group of potentially responsible parties for response actions necessary to address a release of hazardous substances into the environment. The law authorizes two kinds of response actions: (i) short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response, and (ii) long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. Neither we nor any of our predecessors have been designated as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute.

 We generate petroleum product wastes, solid wastes, and ordinary industrial wastes, such as from paints and solvents, that are regulated under RCRA and comparable state statues. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because we are considered small quantity generators of hazardous wastes by the EPA and state regulations. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. The Hazardous Waste Generator Improvement Rule of the EPA provides some additional flexibility for small generators but also increases certain recordkeeping and administrative burdens. Several states are now in the process of adopting this rule. Any additional changes in the regulations could increase our capital and operating costs.
  
 We currently own properties where crude oil, refined petroleum hydrocarbons, and fuel additives have been handled for many years by previous owners. At some facilities, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. Although prior owners and operators may have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, these properties and wastes disposed thereon are now subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed or released wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including impacted groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination to the extent we are not indemnified for such matters.
  
  Water Pollution Regulations. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including chemical components of crude oil and refined products, into federal and state waters. The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters except as authorized by the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency with delegated authority. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risks and subjects us to the provisions of the CWA, OPA 90, and related state requirements.
  
 Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements mandate the use of structures, such as berms and other secondary containment, to prevent hydrocarbons or other pollutants from reaching a jurisdictional body of water in the event of a spill or leak. These requirements prevent pollutant releases and minimize potential impacts should a release occur. We have federally certified OSROs available to respond to a spill and, in the case of our offshore pipelines, we maintain the statutory $35.0 million coverage required proof of financial responsibility. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, we can be subject to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences.
  
 Wastewater is subject to restrictions and strict controls under the CWA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits. Process wastewater from the Nixon refinery is tested and discharged to a nearby municipal treatment facility pursuant to applicable process wastewater permits. Wastewater from our offshore facilities, including our oil and natural gas pipelines and anchor platform, is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable produced water permits. Stormwater at the Nixon facility is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable stormwater permits.
  
  Offshore “Idle Iron” Decommissioning Regulations. In 2018 BSEE updated its earlier 2010 guidance and regulations on decommissioning that mandates lessees and rights-of-way holders permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when no longer useful for operations. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator’s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the minimum bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM.
  
 We are required by BOEM to: (i) maintain acceptable financial assurance (pipeline bonds) for the decommissioning of our assets offshore in federal waters and (ii) decommission these assets following a certain period of inactivity. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained $2.6 million in AROs related to abandonment of these assets. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes (12) and (16)” for additional disclosures related to idle iron decommissioning requirements for our pipelines and facilities assets and related risks.
  
  Health, Safety and Maintenance
  We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety. In general, we believe current expenditures are fulfilling the OSHA requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees. Based on new regulatory developments, we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards. However, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be estimated at this time.
  
 BSEE also requires offshore operators to employ a SEMS plan.  SEMS are designed to reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills, develop protocols as to who at the facility has the ultimate operational safety and decision-making authority, and establish procedures to provide all personnel with “stop work” authority. We have a SEMS program in place.
