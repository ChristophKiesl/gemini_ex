Item 1. Business
We are a geographically diversified homebuilder with active operations in 13 states within three geographic regions in the United States: the West, East, and Southeast. Our homes are designed to appeal to homeowners at different price points across various demographic segments and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction. Our objective is to provide our customers with homes that incorporate extraordinary value and quality, at affordable prices, while seeking to maximize our return on invested capital over the course of a housing cycle.
Beazer Homes USA, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Abernathy Road, Suite 260, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, and our main telephone number is (770) 829-3700. We also provide information about our company, including active communities, through our Internet website located at www.beazer.com. Information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference. 
Business Strategy
We continue to execute against our long-term balanced growth strategy, which we define as the expansion of earnings at a faster rate than our revenue growth, supported by a less-leveraged and return-driven capital structure. This strategy provides us with the flexibility to increase return on capital, reduce leverage, or increase investment in land and other operating assets in response to changing market conditions. 
We remain committed to this strategy, which is designed to increase shareholder value by improving our return on assets while reducing operational risk and debt. Our specific objectives at the beginning of fiscal 2021 included generating higher Adjusted EBITDA and double-digit growth in earnings per share, growing our total lot position through higher land spending and increased use of lot option agreements, and retiring at least $50.0 million of debt. 
For fiscal 2021, we recorded net income of $122.0 million, or $4.01 per diluted share, compared to net income of $52.2 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $262.7 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $204.4 million in the prior year, an increase of $58.3 million, or 28.5%. Over the past five years, we have achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0% for Adjusted EBITDA.
As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, our land position included 21,987 and 17,830 controlled lots, respectively. Through expansion of our use of lot option agreements, 45.4% and 33.0% of our controlled lots, as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively, were under option contracts. 
We repurchased $30.7 million of our Senior Notes and repaid $50.0 million of our Senior Unsecured Term Loan during fiscal 2021. Over the past five years, we repaid a total of $281.4 million of debt. We expect to continue to reduce outstanding debt over time, and we intend to end fiscal 2022 with less than $1.0 billion of outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2021, we had outstanding debt of $1.05 billion.
For fiscal 2022, as we are near the end of our near-term deleveraging goal, we will focus on continuing to grow our land position, improving operating margin, delivering extraordinary customer experience, and encouraging employee well-being. 
Differentiating Beazer Homes
We know that our buyers have many choices when purchasing a home. To help us become a builder of choice and thereby achieve the operational objectives we have outlined, we have identified the following three strategic pillars that differentiate Beazer's homes from both resale homes and other newly built homes:
Mortgage Choice – Most of our buyers need to arrange financing in order to purchase a new home. Unlike many of our major competitors, we have no ownership or other interest in a mortgage company, which allows us to partner with our customers to help them get the most competitive interest rates, fees and service levels available. For every Beazer community, we identify Choice Lenders, who are selected for their ability to provide a comprehensive array of products and programs, meet our high customer service standards and willingness to compete to earn our customer’s business. We then provide our customers with an industry-leading online comparison tool that helps them easily compare multiple mortgage offers side-by-side.
Choice PlansTM – Every family lives in their home differently, which is why we created Choice PlansTM. Choice PlansTM provide our buyers with more floor plan flexibility at no additional cost. For example, buyers of to-be-built homes can typically choose between two different configurations in the kitchen/great room and in the primary bedroom/bathroom based on individual preferences, at no additional cost. Offering these pre-designed floor plan alternatives allows us to offer fewer 
different plans, which improves efficiency and reduce costs while creating living areas that match an individual buyer's lifestyle.
Surprising Performance – We place an emphasis on building high-quality homes and delivering outstanding customer experience. All Beazer homes are designed and built to provide Surprising Performance, which means more quality, comfort, and savings. We deliver these benefits through our people, materials, and process. Our homes are built to the latest ENERGY STAR® standards, and we provide buyers with an energy rating for their home, completed by a qualified third-party rating company. Used homes typically have a HERS® index score (on a scale in which a lower score is better) of 130. As of September 30, 2021, the average new Beazer home has a gross HERS® index score of 56. Each new Beazer home also comes equipped with powerful technologies, including Category 6 ethernet wiring (Cat6), a centralized network panel and immediate internet connectivity via a LTE Wi-Fi router. In December 2020, Beazer became the first national builder to publicly commit to ensuring that by the end of 2025 every home we build will be Net Zero Energy Ready. Net Zero Energy Ready means that each home will have a gross HERS® index score (before any benefit of renewable energy production) of 45 or less, and homeowners will be able to achieve net zero energy consumption by attaching a properly sized renewable energy system.

Seasonal and Quarterly Variability
Our homebuilding operating cycle historically has reflected escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. However, these seasonal patterns may be impacted or reduced by a variety of factors. During fiscal 2021, supply chain disruptions as well as our efforts to actively manage sales pace resulted in a shift from our typical seasonal trend such that higher levels of new order activity were observed during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021, which led to increased closing levels starting in the second fiscal quarter. 
Markets and Product Description
We evaluate a number of factors in determining which geographic markets to enter and remain in as well as which consumer segments to target with our homebuilding activities. We compete in sixteen geographic markets across the United States in part to reduce our exposure to any particular regional economy. Within these markets, we build homes in a variety of new home communities. We continually review our sixteen markets based on aggregate demographic information, land prices and availability, competitive dynamics, and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to re-allocate our investments generally to those markets where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital.
We maintain the flexibility to alter our product mix within a given market, depending on market conditions. In determining our product mix, we consider demographic trends, demand for a particular type of product, product affordability, consumer preferences, land availability, margins, timing, and the economic strength of the market. Depending on the market, we attempt to address one or more of the following categories of home buyers: entry-level, move-up, or 55+. Within these buyer groups, we have developed detailed targeted buyer profiles based on demographic and psychographic data, including information about marital and family status, employment, age, affluence, special interests, media consumption, and distance moved. Although we offer a selection of amenities and home customization options, we generally do not build “custom homes.” In all of our home offerings, we attempt to increase customer satisfaction by incorporating quality and energy-efficient materials, distinctive design features, convenient locations, and competitive prices.
Gatherings. In 2016, Gatherings® by Beazer Homes was officially introduced across several markets within Beazer's geographic footprint through age restricted condominiums. We strive to provide extraordinary value, a strong commitment to customer service, and a quality, lower-maintenance home for those seeking a 55+ lifestyle. In addition to condominiums, we are in the process of expanding the Gatherings® brand to include town homes, villas, duets, and single family homes. Our Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Orlando markets are actively selling Gatherings homes, while development is currently underway in Atlanta, Maryland, and additional sites in Houston. As of September 30, 2021, we have approved communities representing nearly 765 potential future sales.
Marketing and Sales
We make extensive use of digital and traditional marketing vehicles and other promotional activities, including our website (www.beazer.com), real estate listing sites, digital advertising (including search engine marketing and display advertising), social media, video, brochures, direct marketing, and out-of-home advertising (including billboards and signage) located in the immediate areas of our developments, as well as additional activities. In connection with these marketing vehicles, we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks and Internet domain names, including Beazer Homes®, Gatherings®, and Choice PlansTM, for use in our business.
In response to the changing needs of consumers, our sales operations continue to improve our virtual sales tools to connect with our customers online, including a 24/7 chatbot feature with live chat support, self-guided tours to allow homebuyers to tour models privately, safely, and outside of normal business hours, and self-service appointments to help customers schedule an appointment with ease and speed.
Our practice is to build, decorate, furnish, and landscape model homes for each community we build and maintain on-site sales offices. As of September 30, 2021, we maintained and owned 215 model homes. We believe that model homes play a particularly important role in our selling efforts, and we are continuously innovating within our model homes to provide a unique, memorable, and hands-on experience for our customers, including digital kiosks, interactive site maps/plans, interactive magnetic floor plan boards, interactive Surprising Performance rooms, signage, and more. The selection of interior features is also a principal component of our marketing and sales efforts. 
Our homes are customarily sold through commissioned new home sales counselors (who work from the sales offices located in the model homes used in the community) as well as through independent brokers. Our new home counselors are available to assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans, pricing information, tours of model homes, the community's unique selling proposition, detailed explanations of our differentiators as discussed above, and associated savings opportunities. Sales personnel are trained internally through a structured training program focused on sales techniques, product familiarity, competitive products in the area, construction schedules, and Company policies around compliance, which management believes results in a sales force with extensive knowledge of our operating policies and housing products. Sales personnel must be licensed real estate agents where required by law.
We sometimes use various sales incentives in order to attract homebuyers. The use of incentives depends largely on local economic and competitive market conditions. 
Depending on market conditions, we also at times begin construction on a number of homes for which no signed sales contract exists, known as “speculative” or “spec” homes. This speculative inventory satisfies demand by providing near ready or move in ready homes targeted at relocated personnel and others who require a completed home within 60 days.
Operational Overview
Corporate Operations
We perform the following functions at our corporate office to promote standardization and operational excellence:
•evaluate and select geographic markets;
•allocate capital resources for land acquisitions;
•maintain and develop relationships with lenders and capital markets to create and maintain access to financial resources;
•maintain and develop relationships with national product vendors;
•perform various centralized functions including accounting, finance, purchasing, legal, risk, planning/design, and marketing activities to support our field operations; 
•operate and manage information systems and technology support operations; and
•monitor the operations of our divisions and partners. 
We allocate capital resources in a manner consistent with our overall business strategy. We will vary our capital allocation based on market conditions, results of operations, and other factors. Capital commitments are determined through consultation among executive and operational personnel who play an important role in ensuring that new investments are consistent with our strategy. Financial controls are also maintained through the centralization and standardization of accounting and finance activities, policies, and procedures.
Field Operations
The development and construction of each new home community is managed by our operating divisions, each of which is led by a regional market leader and/or an area president who reports to our Chief Executive Officer. Within our operating divisions, our field teams are equipped with the skills needed to complete the functions of land acquisition, land entitlement, land development, home construction, local marketing, sales, warranty service, and certain purchasing and planning/design functions. However, the accounting and accounts payable functions of our field operations are concentrated in our national accounting center, which we consider to be part of our corporate operations.
Land Acquisition and Development
Generally, the land we acquire is purchased only after necessary entitlements have been obtained so that we have the right to begin development or construction as market conditions dictate. The term “entitlements” refers to subdivision approvals, development agreements, tentative maps, or recorded plats, depending on the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Entitlements generally give a developer the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with conditions that are usually within the developer's control. Although entitlements are ordinarily obtained prior to the purchase of land, we are still required to obtain a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process. In limited circumstances, we will purchase property without all necessary entitlements where we have identified an opportunity to build on such property in a manner consistent with our strategy.
We select land for purchase based upon a variety of factors, including:
•internal and external demographic and marketing studies;
•suitability for development during the time period of one to five years from the beginning of the development process to the last closing;
•financial review as to the feasibility of the proposed project, including profit margins and returns on capital employed;
•the ability to secure governmental approvals and entitlements;
•environmental and legal due diligence;
•competition in the area;
•proximity to local traffic corridors, job centers, and other amenities; and
•management's judgment of the real estate market and economic trends and our experience in a particular market.
We generally purchase land or obtain an option to purchase land, which, in either case, requires certain site improvements prior to home construction. Where required, we then undertake, or the grantor of the option then undertakes in the case of land under option, the development activities (through contractual arrangements with local developers, general contractors, and/or subcontractors), which include site planning and engineering as well as constructing roads, water, sewer, and utility infrastructures, drainage and recreational facilities, and other amenities. When available in certain markets, we also buy finished lots that are ready for home construction. During our fiscal 2021 and 2020, we continued to pursue land acquisition opportunities and develop our land positions, spending approximately $440.8 million and $276.9 million, respectively, for land acquisition and $154.7 million and $163.9 million, respectively, for land development. 
We strive to develop a design and marketing concept for each of our communities, which includes determination of the size, style, and price range of the homes, layout of streets and individual lots, and overall community design. The product line offered in a particular new home community depends upon many factors, including the housing generally available in the area, the needs of a particular market, and our cost of lots in the new home community. 
Option Contracts
We acquire certain lots by means of option contracts from various sellers and developers, including land banking entities. Option contracts generally require the payment of a cash deposit or issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a fixed or variable price.
Under option contracts, purchase of the underlying properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers. Our liability under option contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the non-refundable deposits, letters of credit, and other non-refundable amounts incurred, which totaled approximately $114.7 million as of September 30, 2021. The total remaining purchase price, net of cash deposits, committed under all land option contracts was $676.1 million as of September 30, 2021.
We expect to exercise, subject to market conditions and seller satisfaction of contract terms, substantially all of our option contracts. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as market conditions, weather conditions, and the timing of the completion of development activities, will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether lot options will be exercised at all.

Construction
We typically act as the general contractor for the construction of our new home communities. Our project development activities are controlled by our operating divisions whose employees supervise the construction of each new home community by coordinating the activities of independent subcontractors and suppliers, subjecting their work to quality and cost controls and ensuring compliance with zoning and building codes. We specify that quality, durable materials be used in the construction of our homes. Our subcontractors follow design plans prepared by architects and engineers who are retained or directly employed by us and whose designs are geared to the local market. Our home plans are created in a collaborative effort with industry leading architectural firms, allowing us to stay current with changing home design trends as well as expanding our focus on engineering without sacrificing value for our customers.
Agreements with our subcontractors and materials suppliers are generally entered into after a competitive bidding process during which we obtain information from prospective subcontractors and vendors with respect to their financial condition and ability to perform their agreements with us in accordance with the specifications we provide. Subcontractors typically are retained on a project-by-project basis to complete construction at a fixed price. We do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for materials being utilized for homes under construction. We have numerous suppliers of raw materials and services used in our business, and such materials and services have been and continue to be available. However, material prices may fluctuate due to various factors, including demand or supply shortages and the price of certain commodities, which may be beyond the control of us or our vendors. When it is economically advantageous, we enter into regional and national supply contracts with certain of our vendors. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good.
Warranty Program
We currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined standards. In addition, we provide a limited warranty for up to ten years covering only certain defined structural element failures. 
Our homebuilding work is performed by subcontractors who typically must agree to indemnify us with regard to their work and provide certificates of insurance demonstrating that they have met our insurance requirements and have named us as an additional insured under their policies. Therefore, many claims relating to workmanship and materials that result in warranty spending are the primary responsibility of these subcontractors.
In addition, we maintain third-party insurance, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, for most construction defects that we encounter in the normal course of business. We believe that our warranty and litigation accruals and third-party insurance are adequate to cover the ultimate resolution of our potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation. However, there can be no assurance that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by homebuyers; that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates; that we will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence, or building related claims; or that claims will not arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and/or not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. Please see Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.
Customer Financing
As previously mentioned, we do not provide mortgage origination services. Unlike many of our peers, we have no ownership interest in any lender and are able to promote competition among lenders on behalf of our customers through our Mortgage Choice program. Approximately 94% of our fiscal 2021 customers elected to finance a portion of their home purchase.
Competition
The development and sale of residential properties is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality, and price with numerous large and small homebuilders, including many homebuilders with nationwide operations and greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us. We also compete for residential sales with individual resales of existing homes and available rental housing. 
We utilize our experience within our geographic markets and the breadth of our product line to vary regional product offerings to reflect changing market conditions. We strive to respond to market conditions and to capitalize on the opportunities for advantageous land acquisitions in desirable locations. Our product offerings strive to provide extraordinary value at an affordable price with intentional focus on Millennials and Baby Boomers because they are the two largest demographic groups of potential home buyers.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building, design, constructions, the availability of water, and matters concerning the protection of health, safety and the environment. These laws may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Any delay or refusal from government agencies to grant us necessary licenses, permits and approvals could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
As part of our due diligence process for land acquisitions, we often use third-party environmental consultants to investigate potential environmental risks, and we require disclosures, representations and warranties from land sellers regarding environmental risks. We also take steps prior to our acquisition of the land to gain reasonable assurance as to the precise scope of any remediation work required and the costs associated with removal, site restoration and/or monitoring. To the extent contamination or other environmental issues have occurred in the past, we will attempt to recover restoration costs from third parties, such as the generators of hazardous waste, land sellers or others in the prior chain of title and/or their insurers. 
In order to provide homes to homebuyers qualifying for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured or Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct homes in compliance with FHA and VA regulations. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding operating procedures, investments, lending, and privacy disclosures and premiums.
In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. Also, in various states, our new home counselors are required to be licensed real estate agents and to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to real estate agents.
Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, where applicable, could result in loss of licensing and a restriction of our business activities in the applicable jurisdiction.
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2021, we employed 1,052 persons, of whom 258 were sales and marketing personnel and 257 were construction personnel. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, at times certain of the independent subcontractors engaged by us may be represented by labor unions or may be subject to collective bargaining arrangements. 
We believe that our employees are critical to our continued growth and success. As a result, a safe and healthy working environment for our employees at every level of our organizations is our highest priority. This includes a health and safety audit system with comprehensive independent third-party inspections, as well as required attendance at certain health and safety related training programs by all of our team members applicable to their respective job responsibilities.
Upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we rapidly established a cross-functional task-force and deployed enhanced IT resources to facilitate new processes and procedures and keep our teams informed with the most up to date information. We also took a number of additional and unprecedented actions, including temporarily closing our sales centers, model homes and design centers to the general public and shifting to appointment-only interactions with our customers where permitted, as well 
as modified our construction operations to enforce enhanced safety protocols around social distancing, hygiene, and health screening. 
We have also adopted ethical practices and policies to direct how we do business. The objectives of our practices and policies underscore this commitment, including:
•To treat all employees with dignity and respect; 
•To embrace employee diversity and inclusion;
•To strongly encourage opportunities for training, growth, and advancement; and
•To uphold ethical standards and comply with applicable laws and our internal guidelines, including a Code of Conduct applicable to all employees and an actively-managed ethics hotline.
To put our objectives in action, we consistently measure employee engagement, maintain disciplined equal employment recruiting, hiring and promotion policies, provide company-wide learning and development programs on inclusion (beginning with unconscious bias training for all employees), and review pay practices for fairness and equality with a third-party consultant.
Competition for qualified personnel is also intense across our footprint. We believe our competitive advantage lies in our ability to attract and retain talented people who consistently exemplify integrity and respect – powerful attributes that enable us to focus on outcomes versus mere hours worked. From competitive compensation and benefits programs, to industry-leading programs such as 12-week parental leave and flexible time off (with no accrual or maximum time away from work), our employee experience is centered on engagement and work-life balance.
