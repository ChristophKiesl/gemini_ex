Business Segments
In 2015, our business operations consisted of two reportable segments, the Pharmaceutical Packaging Systems segment (“Packaging Systems”) and the Pharmaceutical Delivery Systems segment (“Delivery Systems”). Beginning in 2016, we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and 
3

development, which resulted in a change to Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products as our reportable segments.
Segment results presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this change. Please refer to Note 17, Segment Information, for additional details.
Proprietary Products Segment
Our Proprietary Products reportable segment, which is a combination of the previous Packaging Systems segment and the proprietary products portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, develops commercial, operational, and innovation strategies across our global network, with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug customers.
Proprietary Products offers proprietary packaging, containment and drug delivery products. The packaging products include stoppers and seals for injectable packaging systems, which are designed to help ensure drug compatibility and stability, while also supporting operational efficiency. Proprietary Products also offers syringe and cartridge components, including custom solutions for the specific needs of injectable drug applications, as well as administration systems that can enhance the safe delivery of drugs through advanced reconstitution, mixing and transfer technologies.
In 2016, we announced the availability of the 1-3mL NovaPure® plunger, an innovative, high-quality component for pre-filled delivery systems, designed to reduce particulates, ensure consistency of delivery and fit the changing needs of higher-volume injectable drug delivery systems. This new offering adds to our current portfolio of NovaPure products, which includes the 1mL long NovaPure plunger and 13mm and 20mm NovaPure lyo and serum stoppers. Our NovaPure plungers are designed and manufactured using scientific, risk-mitigating Quality by Design principles to ensure dimensional control and consistency, sub-visible and visible particulate control, and low parts per million defect attributes.
We also offer drug containment solutions, including CZ vials, syringes and cartridges, which can provide a high-quality solution to glass incompatibility issues and can stand up to cold storage environments, while reducing the risk of breakage that exists with glass. It is an integrated life-cycle solution that is designed to maintain drug safety, purity and efficacy.
In addition, we offer a variety of self-injection systems, which are innovative, patient-centric technologies that are easy to use and can be combined with connected health technologies that have the potential to increase adherence.
The development of our SmartDose® technology platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the first combination product that incorporates our SmartDose technology for use in the U.S. in July 2016, and several other active development programs are in place. This technology platform is designed for controlled, subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs, and the device incorporates prefillable CZ cartridges. The technology platform is fully programmable, has a single push-button operation and a hidden needle for safety.
Analytical Lab Services completes the product offerings in Proprietary Products. This group provides specialized testing for drug packaging, devices and administration systems.
The growth strategy for Proprietary Products includes organic growth through market segmentation, new-product innovation, strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion. Proprietary Products has manufacturing facilities in North and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific, with affiliated companies in Mexico and Japan. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.
See Note 17, Segment Information, for net sales and asset information for Proprietary Products.

Contract-Manufactured Products Segment
Our Contract-Manufactured Products reportable segment, which consists of the contract manufacturing portion of the previous Delivery Systems segment, serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design, manufacture, and automated assembly of complex devices, primarily for pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device customers.
Contract-Manufactured Products includes a variety of custom contract-manufacturing and assembly solutions, which use such technologies as multi-component molding, in-mold labeling, ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly. We manufacture customer-owned components and devices used in surgical, diagnostic, ophthalmic, injectable, and other drug delivery systems, as well as consumer products.
Contract-Manufactured Products has expertise in product design and development, including in-house mold design, an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling, process design and validation and high-speed automated assemblies. Contract-Manufactured Products has manufacturing operations in North America and Europe. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites.
See Note 17, Segment Information, for net sales and asset information for Contract-Manufactured Products.
International
We have significant operations outside of the United States (“U.S.”), which are managed through the same business segments as our U.S. operations – Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. Sales outside of the U.S. accounted for 51.1% of consolidated net sales in 2016. For a geographic breakdown of sales, see Note 17, Segment Information.
Although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks. These risks include currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. Dollar (“USD”), multiple tax jurisdictions and, particularly in South America and Israel, political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products. 
See further discussion of our international operations, the risks associated with our international operations, and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors; Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources; Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk; Note 1 under the captions Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation; and Note 9, Derivative Financial Instruments.
Raw Materials
We use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products: elastomers, aluminum and plastic. Elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials. We currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers.
We employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments, which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers, we rely on single-source suppliers for many critical raw materials. We purchase certain raw materials in the open market. This strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem. These risks are managed, where possible, by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigorous quality control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets and know-how, is important to our business. We own or license intellectual property rights, including issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products. Some key value-added and proprietary products and processes are licensed from Daikyo. Our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market position and in the growth of our business, and are expected to continue to be of value in the future. 
Seasonality
Although our Proprietary Products business is not inherently seasonal, sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers' production schedules and the year-end impact of holidays on production. This can vary from year-to-year, depending upon customer inventory management programs and customer product launches.
Our Contract-Manufactured Products business is not inherently seasonal.
Working Capital
We are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements. In addition, some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders, which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption. Levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above. For a more detailed discussion of working capital, please refer to the discussion in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Marketing
Our Proprietary Products customers include most of the major biologic, generic, and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world, which incorporate our components and other offerings into their products for distribution to the ultimate end-user.
Our Contract-Manufactured Products customers include many of the world's largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and medical device companies. Contract-Manufactured Products components generally are incorporated into our customers' manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly.
Our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network, with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors. 
Our ten largest customers accounted for 36.8% of our consolidated net sales in 2016, but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of net sales. See Note 17, Segment Information, for information on sales by significant product group.
Order Backlog
Order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer. We also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers. Products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received. Order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors, including customer ordering patterns and the necessary lead-time to deliver customer orders. Order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand, and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth. 
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the order backlog for Proprietary Products was $373.3 million and $413.2 million, respectively. The decrease in backlog primarily reflects a return to normal levels and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. In 2015, we had orders being placed further in advance by certain customers, some as much as 
6

several quarters, while others focused more on short-term stock-building. The majority of the order backlog for Proprietary Products at December 31, 2016 is expected to be filled during 2017.
The majority of Contract-Manufactured Products manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations, with terms between one and three years, subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements.
Competition
We compete with several companies across our Proprietary Products product lines. Due to the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our long-standing participation in the market, competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance, although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost-control programs across their operations.
In addition, there is a small number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components. We compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management, as well as our knowledge of, and experience in, compliance with regulatory requirements.
We also have specialized knowledge of container closure components, which is integral to developing delivery systems. With our range of proprietary technologies, we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices, including suppliers of prefillable syringes, auto-injectors, safety needles and other proprietary systems.
We differentiate ourselves from our competition by being an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide pre-approval primary packaging support and engineering development, analytical services, regulatory expertise and after-sale technical support. Customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites.
Our Contract-Manufactured Products business operates in very competitive markets for its products. The competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders. Given the cost pressures they face, many of our customers look off-shore to reduce cost. We differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as high-speed automated assembly, insert-molding, multi-shot molding and expertise with multiple-piece closure systems.
Research and Development Activities
We maintain our own research-scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products, and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development. Our quality control, regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems. The engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing, and for the design and construction of processing equipment. We continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market. Research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes, injectable containers, advanced injection and safety and administration systems.
Commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years. New products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices, and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer's products following our development period.
We spent $36.8 million in 2016, $34.1 million in 2015, and $37.3 million in 2014 on research and development, all of which related to Proprietary Products.

Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2016 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2017.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 7,300 people in our operations throughout the world, including approximately 7,100 full-time employees.
