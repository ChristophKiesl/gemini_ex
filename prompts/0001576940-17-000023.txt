 ITEM 1.BUSINESS.
 General
 We are engaged in the development, design, construction, marketing and sale of single-family attached and detached homes in metropolitan areas in Colorado, Austin and San Antonio, Texas (which we refer to as “Central Texas”), Houston, Texas, Las Vegas, Nevada, Atlanta, Georgia, and Salt Lake City, Utah.  Our homebuilding operations are organized into the following six operating segments based on the geographic markets in which we operate: Atlanta, Central Texas, Colorado, Houston, Nevada, and Utah.  In many of our projects, in addition to building homes, we are responsible for the entitlement and development of the underlying land. 
 Commencing with our private placement of 12.1 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which we refer to as our “common stock”) in May 2013, in which we raised $223.8 million in net proceeds, we have grown significantly through acquisitions of existing homebuilders, executing on our land acquisition strategy, and a partnership with another homebuilder.  Through our acquisitions of existing homebuilders,  we entered the (i) Central Texas market in September 2013 through the acquisition of Jimmy Jacobs Homes L.P. (which we refer to as “Jimmy Jacobs”) for approximately $16 million, (ii) Las Vegas, Nevada market in April 2014 through the acquisition of Las Vegas Land Holdings, LLC (which we refer to as “LVLH”) for approximately $165 million, (iii) Houston, Texas market in August 2014 through the acquisition of Grand View Builders (which we refer to as “Grand View”) for approximately $13 million, (iv) Atlanta, Georgia market in November 2014 through the acquisition of Peachtree Communities Group, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (which we refer to as “Peachtree”) for approximately $57 million.  We entered the Utah market in May 2016 by acquiring 47 finished lots in Salt Lake City.  In December 2016, we entered the Charlotte, North Carolina market by acquiring 57 finished lots, but had not commenced building or selling homes as of December 31, 2016.  During 2016, we increased our land position, improved the quality of our backlog, and strengthened our capital resources to grow our business.  
 Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K are available on our website at www.centurycommunities.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the “SEC”).
 Description of Business
 ﻿
 Land acquisition process
 ﻿
 We acquire land for our homebuilding operations with the primary intent to develop and construct single family detached or attached homes for sale on the acquired land.  From time to time we may sell land to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land positions. We generally acquire land for cash, either through bulk acquisitions of land or through option contracts.  Option contracts are generally structured where we have the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land at predetermined prices on a defined schedule.  Potential land acquisitions are identified by our local management within the markets in which we operate.  Our land acquisition process includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis which include an evaluation of expected returns, projected gross margins, estimated sales paces and pricing.  All potential land acquisitions are approved by our Corporate office to ensure appropriate capital allocations taking into consideration current and projected inventory levels and risk adjusted returns.  
 ﻿
 Homebuilding marketing and sales process
 ﻿
 We build and sell an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points. Our emphasis is on acquiring well located land positions and offering quality homes with innovative design elements. The core of our business plan is to acquire and develop land strategically, based on our understanding of population growth patterns, entitlement restrictions and infrastructure development. We focus on locations within our markets with convenient access to metropolitan areas that are generally characterized by diverse economic and employment bases and demographics and increasing populations. We believe these conditions create strong demand for new housing, and these locations represent what we believe to be attractive opportunities for long-term growth. We also seek assets that have desirable characteristics, such as good access to major job centers, schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities, and we strive to offer a broad spectrum of product types in these locations. Product development and customer service are key components of the lifestyle connection we seek to establish with each individual homebuyer. Our construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeal to a broad range of potential homebuyers, from entry-level to first- and second-time move-up buyers and lifestyle homebuyers. Additionally, we believe

our diversified product strategy enables us to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. 
 ﻿
 Our philosophy is to provide a positive experience to our homeowners by actively engaging them in the building process and by enhancing communication, knowledge and satisfaction. We provide our customers with customization options to suit their lifestyle needs and have developed a number of home designs with features such as outdoor living spaces, one-story living and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to universal design needs. We also engineer our homes for energy efficiency, which is aimed at reducing the impact on the environment and lowering energy costs to our homebuyers. As part of these efforts, we offer homebuyers environmentally friendly alternatives, such as solar power to supplement a home’s energy needs.
 We engage architects, engineers and other professionals in connection with the home design process who are familiar with local market preferences, constraints, conditions and requirements. We serve as the general contractor, with all construction work typically performed by subcontractors. While we maintain long-standing relationships with many of our subcontractors and design professionals, we typically do not enter into long-term contractual commitments with them. 
 ﻿
 We sell our homes through our own sales representatives and through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes and the selection of options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. 
 We advertise directly to potential homebuyers through the internet and in newspapers and trade publications, as well as through marketing brochures and newsletters. We may also use billboards, radio and television advertising, and our website, to market the location, price range and availability of our homes. We also attempt to operate in conspicuously located communities that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns. Model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts by not only creating an attractive atmosphere, but also by displaying options and upgrades. 
 Customer relations, quality control and warranty programs
 We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors we employ are monitored and we make regular inspections and evaluations of our subcontractors to ensure our standards are met. 
 We maintain quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing and post-closing periods. These employees are also responsible for providing after sales customer service. Our quality and service initiatives include taking customers on a comprehensive tour of their home prior to closing and using customer survey results to improve our standards of quality and customer satisfaction. 
 Generally, we provide each homeowner with product warranties covering workmanship and materials for one year from the time of closing, and warranties covering structural systems for eight to 10 years from the time of closing in connection with our general liability insurance policy. The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide to us customary warranties on workmanship.
 Customer Financing 
 We seek to assist our homebuyers in obtaining financing by arranging with mortgage lenders to offer qualified buyers a variety of financing options. Most homebuyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home, and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers. During the fourth quarter of 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, Parkway Financial Corp., formed Inspire Home Loans (which we refer to as “Inspire”).  Inspire will offer mortgage services to our homebuyers.  In addition to Inspire, Parkway Title LLC will provide title services to select markets in which we operate. Materials 
 When constructing homes, we use various materials and components. It has typically taken us four to six months or more to construct a home, during which time materials are subject to price fluctuations. Such price fluctuations are caused by several factors, among them seasonal variation in availability and increased demand for materials as a result of the improved housing market.

Seasonality 
 We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Historically, new order activity is highest during the spring and summer months. As a result, we typically have more homes under construction, close more homes, and have greater revenues and operating income in the second half of our fiscal year.  Historical results are not necessarily indicative of current or future homebuilding activities. 
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we own and operate a golf course within our Rhodes Ranch community in our Nevada division. We experience lower average daily rounds in the second and third quarters of the year, and therefore lower revenues, due to the high temperatures during the summer and early fall months in Nevada, as well as reseeding activities in September to prepare the courses for the winter months. Conversely, we experience higher average daily rounds and therefore higher revenues during the first and fourth quarters of the year when lower temperatures are typically experienced in Nevada.
 Governmental regulation and environmental matters 
 We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. 
 ﻿
 We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. 
 Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in those cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. To date, we have never had a significant environmental issue. 
 Segment and geographic area disclosures
 ﻿
 We have identified our Atlanta, Central Texas, Colorado, Houston, Nevada, and Utah divisions as reportable operating segments.  Our Corporate operations are a nonoperating segment, as it serves to support our homebuilding operations through functions such as our executive, finance, treasury, human resources, and accounting departments.

  Competition
 ﻿
 We face competition in the homebuilding industry, which is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, home buying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion or lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products, or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. We also compete with other homebuilders that have long-standing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or plan to operate and we compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
