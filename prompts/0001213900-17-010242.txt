ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
NightFood Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us” “the Company” or “NightFood”) is a Nevada corporation organized on October 16, 2013 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of NightFood, Inc., a New York corporation (the “Subsidiary”) from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson. All of our operations are conducted by the Subsidiary. We are in the business of manufacturing, marketing and distributing snacks specially formulated and promoted for evening consumption. A large number of Americans consume nighttime snacks that are high in sugar, fat, sodium, and calories; such snacks can impair sleep and also impair health in general. Management believes that our products are unique in the food industry and that there is a substantial market for our products, through online commerce as well as traditional retail distribution. Our corporate address is 520 White Plains Road – Suite 500, Tarrytown, New York 10591 and our telephone number is 888-888-6444. We maintain a web site at www.nightfood.com. Any information that may appear on our web site should not be deemed to be a part of this report.
 
Industry Overview
 
We are an early-stage company that is seeking to establish a market within the snack industry by offering a line of snack foods that are specifically formulated for evening consumption. Based on available figures for 2013 published by SymphonyIRI Group, American consumers spend over $50 Billion annually on snacks consumed at night, and this figure continues to grow. A majority of adults are trying to eat foods and snacks that they understand will prevent or manage health problems and 37% of consumers are willing to pay more for foods with perceived health benefits. Moreover, industry data indicates that the most popular nighttime snack choices include products and categories that are traditionally considered high in calories, and “unhealthy” options, such as cookies, salty snacks (chips, pretzels, and popcorn), ice cream, and candy.
Our Products, Present and Proposed
 
Our initial product is the NightFood nutrition bar. NightFood nutrition bars are made from commercially available ingredients and a proprietary combination of other components in a proprietary process. During the course of fiscal 2016, the Company modified its packaging, positioning, and branding, including switching from a 6 count retail pack to a 12 count pack for the bars. The packages are typically merchandised both open and closed, so the consumer can purchase an individual bar, or an entire box of bars.. NightFood® is the first product positioned as a healthier and better alternative to other convenient nighttime snack options. Compared to the existing popular options, each 140 calorie NightFood® bar is specially formulated to satisfy late-night cravings, tackle nighttime hunger, on fewer calories, and with a healthier, more sleep-friendly nutritional profile. We believe that NightFood® bars are an optimal nighttime snack in terms of composition and calories. In addition, the bars contain a clinically proven bioactive ingredient called Chocamine®. Chocamine is a patented natural cocoa extract that is believed to promote satiety and craving satisfaction, while also providing the health and relaxation benefits of chocolate without the caffeine, fat, calories, and sugars.

In April of 2016, the Company reached an agreement with RFI Ingredients, LLC, the exclusive manufacturer of Chocamine, which granted the Company, subject to possible future minimum volume requirements, exclusive use of Chocamine in any snack food products formulated and marketed for nighttime consumption. 
 
Depending upon the success of the NightFood® bar and our available resources, we intend to consider expanding our product line to include formulations with and without sleep aiding bioactive ingredients, nighttime snack products specifically for children, and snacks in different food formats such as cookies, chips, ice cream, etc. In furtherance of our planned expansion of our product offerings, we have entered into an agreement to acquire a company which is licensed to produce FiberOne™ ice cream. See Business-Planned Acquisition However, that agreement has not been completed and its future is uncertain as various deadlines have passed.
 
Production
 
We have utilized contract manufacturers for producing our products, packaging for our products, and 3rd party logistics for warehousing and order fulfillment. For our warehousing and logistics, we are currently using Landis Logistics. For our next production run of nutrition bars, we are currently evaluating various potential manufacturers. We believe that the nature of the market for such services ensures there will be several alternative suppliers available on acceptable terms.
Marketing and Distribution


During FY2017, the Company received purchase orders from its largest retail chain to date, in Meijer supermarkets. NightFood bars are available in both flavors in substantially all Meijer supermarket locations.
 
Management believes that securing a chain like Meijer can be a tremendous milestone. However, the Company believes the opportunity for most rapid and efficient scaling of revenue is through direct-to-consumer online channels, and that is where we are directing our focus at this time. To that end, the Company has implemented a strategy that it believes will allow for much more significant revenues starting in FY2018.
 
NightFood 12-packs were made available on Amazon for the first time on June 9, 2017. To date, sales have been promising, and customer reviews have averaged well over 4 stars out of 5. The Company issued a news release on August 23, 2017 that in July 2017, gross direct-to-consumer sales were higher than any other month in Company history, exceeding $10,000. In addition, it was announced that as of August 23, 2017, August revenues to date had already surpassed those of July, 2017.
 
The Company expects to launch its primary direct-to-consumer sales initiative through a relationship with marketing partner Common Thread Collective (CTC) during late September or early October, 2017.
 
If successful, the relationship with CTC will allow the Company to get a substantially greater return on each direct-to-consumer advertising dollar, resulting in accelerated revenue growth. . We can give no assurances as to the revenues to be derived from these efforts. Furthermore, any new initiative includes many risks including unanticipated delays.
 
Competition
 
The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such participants as large companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A. and Quaker Oats and more specialized companies such as Cliff Bar, Quest Nutrition and many smaller companies. Many of these competitors have well established names and products. Management is not aware of any competitor offering snacks targeting the nighttime snack occasion, or formulated to satisfy unhealthy nighttime cravings in a sleep-friendly way. We will initially compete based upon the unique nature of our product. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We own the registered trademark “NightFood®” and believe that it will prove important to our business. Additionally we own the domain NightFood.com as well as many other relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com, nighttimesnack.com, and nighttimesnacking.com, as well as NightFood.us, NightFood.net, TryNightFood.com, GetNightFood.com, NiteFood.com, TryNightFood.com, BuyNightFood.com, and Night-Food.com. We also own the toll-free number 888-888-NIGHT. We rely on proprietary information as to our formulas and have non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers.  In June 2017, after receiving unsolicited inquiries from international distributors in multiple foreign countries, the Company retained the intellectual property law firm Pinnacle IP to assist and consult on matters of international trademark protection for the NightFood brand.

Personnel
 
We currently have no employees except Sean Folkson, our President and CEO, and Peter Leighton, our VP of Marketing who is currently serving the company on a part-time basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan, we anticipate hiring additional employees in the future to assist with various company functions. We rely on consultants and outsourced services to accomplish work that might otherwise be done by employees in a large established company.
Customers
 
In FY 2017, one customer, KeHE Distributing, made up 87% of our revenue.
 
Possible Planned Acquisition
 
On November 25, 2016 we executed and delivered a Plan of Reorganization Including Option to Acquire (the “Plan”) by and among the Registrant, Hook Group, LLC (“Hook”) and Suffield Foods. LLC (“Suffield”). The Plan contemplates our acquiring an equity interest in and potentially merging Hook and its subsidiary Suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. Pursuant to the Plan, we have agreed to use its best efforts to invest up to $9,000,000 in Hook in exchange for preferred equity in Hook. The Plan contemplated an investment in Hook by the Registrant in tranches over approximately 18 months. The Plan provided that any time after we had invested $7,500,000 in Hook, we may request a merger of Hook with and into our wholly owned subsidiary, Fiber One™ Ice Cream, Inc., in exchange for the Hook members receiving a 50% shareholder interest in us. Such merger would be subject to shareholder approval by us. Hook is a licensee of General Mills Marketing, Inc. and holds the right to manufacture and distribute ice cream under the Fiber One™ brand name. We are seeking to raise funds through the sale of equity to meet our obligations under the Plan, but has obtained limited commitments for funding. If funding is not realized, the Plan may not go into effect. The forgoing is a summary of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the Plan, which is an exhibit hereto. We anticipate, based on discussions with Hook management, that the Plan will be amended to change the amount and timing of capital investments due thereunder to require a smaller investment by us prior to the merger. However, there is no written agreement for such amendment and we cannot give assurance that the acquisition with Hook will occur. At this time there is no enforceable agreement for completion of this transaction and we are pursuing other avenues for future revenues. Therefore the consummation of this acquisition is presently not likely.
