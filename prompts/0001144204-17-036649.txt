Each product subscription includes a core set of tools/research along with the personal finance management suite providing an individual complete access to the information necessary to cultivate and manage their financial situation. Wealth Generators offers four packages available through a monthly subscription that can be cancelled at any time at the discretion of the customer. A unique component of the product marketing plan is the distribution method whereby all subscriptions are sold via current participating customers who choose to distribute and sell the services.

Recent Developments
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company entered into a Contribution Agreement with the members of Wealth Generators, LCC, a limited liability company (“Wealth Generators”), each of which are accredited investors (“Wealth Generators Members”) pursuant to which the Wealth Generators Members agreed to contribute 100% of the outstanding securities of Wealth Generators in exchange for an aggregate of 1,358,670,942 shares of our common stock of the Company (the “Wealth Generators Contribution”).  The closing of the Wealth Generators Contribution occurred on March 31, 2017.  Considering that, following the contribution, the Wealth Generators Members control the majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock and the Company effectively succeeded its operations to Wealth Generators, it is considered the accounting acquirer in this reverse-merger transaction. A reverse-merger transaction is considered, and accounted for as, a capital transaction in substance; it is equivalent to the issuance of Wealth Generators securities for the Company’s net monetary assets accompanied by a recapitalization.  Wealth Generators is the surviving and continuing entity and the historical financials following the reverse merger transaction will be those of Wealth Generators. 
 
As a result of the Wealth Generators Contribution, the following Wealth Generators Members received shares of common stock of the Company as follows:
 

Wealth Engineering LLC | 408,144,751

The Products & Services
 
Our Philosophy
 
By enabling the marriage of technology and knowledge we are able to deliver innovative solutions directly to individuals around the world. Education and information for personal finance and general financial education is largely overlooked in all levels of education. An on-going cycle of debt accumulation, inability to save, lack of planning and inadequate knowledge on how to cultivate our “capital” is passed from generation to generation.
 
By creating easy access, focused tutorials, and step by step planning, our education and technology tools provide individuals the necessary information to understand the power of proper utilization of money along with the ability to design their own path toward financial fitness.
 
Our products generally fit under 3 categories:
 

· | FIND - Find money you didn't know you had by learning to better allocate the money you already make. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GROW - Grow your wealth utilizing the financial markets with powerful technology and the experience of market experts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | KEEP - Keep more of what you've earned by leveraging digital tools that make tax-time headaches like receipt and mileage tracking a snap.

FxOnE Alert Tool - Wealth Generators created a convenience tool to help the user follow the alerts without having to stop what the user is doing. Our proprietary technology software allows the user to personalize the trade parameters and risk management so the user can participate even when not available.
The FX Accelerator utilizes technology to monitor the Forex market, attempts to identify opportunities, and sends signals in real time. It utilizes proprietary software and algorithmic technology to track the most active currency pairs in the Forex market. The FX Accelerator is a higher volume strategy issuing 2 to 12 opportunities per day. The FX Accelerator employs a systematic arbitraging strategy and uses extensive quantitative analysis of real-time price data to detect opportunities.
The FX Multiplier 2.0 allows the user to be a part of the Forex market as a liquidity provider, which is typically only available to institutions. Forex trading generally involves predicting the strength of one currency to another. The FX Multiplier 2.0; however, does not attempt to make market predictions, it simply relies on a performance based algorithm and artificial intelligence technology to strategically accumulate inventory. The FX Multiplier 2.0 is active at all times, strategically controlling inventory. It moves with the market, holding inventory of currency ahead of the market so when that supply is in demand, small profits can be achieved on the inventory.
EQUITY MARKETS
 
The goal of the Equity Pack brings the knowledge and expertise of individuals who have been involved in the market for years directly to the user. Our market experts provide the financial technology, education, and research that allows the user to make decisions concerning the user’s money in the market. The user maintains complete control of the user’s money by using an online brokerage of your choosing. Most equity pack strategies require a margin account, and you will need level four options approval or higher.

Keep
 
The core component of our Keep philosophy is the deductr software and its ability to track and manage potential tax write-offs including automated mileage tracking in real-time. Fully deploying the capabilities of deductr, an individual can see their up to the minute potential tax write offs throughout the year. Tax season becomes a painless submission of deductr reports versus the agonizing manual process of trying to calculate expenditures once per year.
Our Packages
 
Each of our packages includes all three components of the FIND * GROW * KEEP philosophy. The only change in package offerings is the type of financial research and education selected in the GROW portion.
 
Each of our product packages includes a ten day no questions asked return policy. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time and are billed monthly.
 
Distribution Method
 
The Company uses a network marketing distribution model to sell its product subscriptions. A current customer can participate in the optional bonus plan that rewards them for selling product subscriptions. We believe this component of our offering is extremely powerful as it provides:

· | An additional income stream for the member who becomes a distributor 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Individuals are much more comfortable discussing financial matters with people they know 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The network becomes a support system for the subscribers as they learn together and share their experiences 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The distribution model, while powerful, requires strict policies and procedures to ensure the company’s presentation and messaging are accurate and compliant.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Various laws and regulations in the United States and other countries regulate network marketing, or direct selling. These laws and regulations exist at many levels of government in many different forms, including statutes, rules, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative orders. Generally, the regulations are directed at: (i) ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within a sales organization is based on product sales rather than on investments in the organization or on other criteria that are not related to sales; and (ii) preventing the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities. Network marketing regulations are inherently fact-based and often do not include "bright line" rules. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that the regulations, or a regulator's interpretation and enforcement of the regulations, could change.
 
Network marketing companies, and the industry in general, continue to experience significant media and public scrutiny in many countries. Several companies that use similar distribution methods to ours have been scrutinized and penalized in several markets where we operate. This scrutiny, along with the uncertainty of the laws and regulations pertaining to network marketing in many countries, can affect how a regulator or member of the public perceives our Company. We cannot predict the impact that this scrutiny may have on our business, the industry in general or our stock price.
 
Competition
 
The Company faces competition for each of its product categories but does not have a similar competitor with the full suite of services offered. Each of the financial education products, alerts, tools and newsletters face competition from similar product companies such as TheStreet.com, Motley’s Fool, Jim Cramer and similar subscription based financial research services. The personal money management education and tools face competition from free mobile apps designed for the same purpose although Investview’s personal money management does not advertise or entice the user to refinance, secure new loans and is a pure management tool that serves the individual and not the advertiser. The company’s tax management tools and education have limited competition and we have deployed Deductr as our tool of choice. Unique to our company is not the individual product but the combined suite of products for one monthly subscription price, cancellable at any time by the user and distributed exclusively by the active members through the optional bonus plan for those who choose to sell the service to others.

We believe our competitive advantages include:
 - One of the most generous bonus programs in the network marketing segment
 - A management team with extensive experience in financial education and market strategy research/technology
 - A young and motivated distributor base
 - A large demographic that services all genders, race, religion, and nationalities
 - A delivery platform enabling us to launch new products quickly and efficiently worldwide
 
Our competitive weaknesses include:
 - translation challenges as we continue international expansion
 - components of our distributor backend that are programmed by third party providers
 
Intellectual Property
 
The company’s success is predicated on the adoption of new and innovative technology, education and research along with constantly improving convenience tools. The delivery of alerts and financial information through our platform provides various levels of automation that is programmed and designed by the company exclusively for our products. We own the intellectual property for many of our products strategies and platform delivery mechanisms while we make other products available through licensed arrangements. In this way, we can continually offer a full suite of “best of breed” services to ensure our members are receiving the most value and leading-edge programs for their monthly subscription.
Government Regulation
 
We have positioned the Company as a knowledge provider and educator, which seeks to augment a user’s informed decision-making process, rather than act as a conductor of investment decisions or a representative of investment services. As such, our activities do not fall within the scope of securities industry regulation. We do not provide securities brokerage or investment advisory services. Our products and services also do not require that any representative distributing the services of Investview conduct themselves as an investment advisor or broker. We in fact encourage all representatives and users of our information services to seek unrelated investment professionals for securities related activities.
 
We are subject to government regulation in connection with securities laws and regulations applicable to all publicly owned companies, as well as laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally. We are also increasingly subject to government regulation and legislation specifically targeting Internet companies, such as privacy regulations adopted at the local, state, national and international levels and taxes levied at the state level. Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet, enforcement of existing laws, such as consumer protection regulations, in connection with Web-based activities has become more aggressive, and it is expected that new laws and regulations will continue to be enacted at the local, state, national and international levels. Such new legislation, alone or combined with increasingly aggressive enforcement of existing laws, could inhibit the growth in use of the Internet and decrease the acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium, which could in turn decrease the demand for our services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance and business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31st, 2017, the Company has 22 employees.
