At December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of such loans was $59,895, all of which was payable to related parties. These loans are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.

Following December 31, 2020, the Company believes that it will require additional funding for ongoing operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and have no current arrangements for any such financing.
 
Risks and Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
The Company has had only limited revenues which have been derived from its consulting agreements.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.

COVID-19 Pandemic. 
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Several countries around the world, including China, have taken steps to restrict travel. Our operations are principally located in China, which has taken action to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Disruptions to our business operations, or to our vendors’ or customers’ business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of facilities or the ability to travel. If a critical number of our employees or consultants become too ill to work, or we are not able to access sufficient human resources due to enforced office closures, our ability to conduct our business could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Similarly, if our customers experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19, or any other, pandemic, demand for our services could also be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries and localities in which we or our vendors and customers operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Competition 
 
The Company encounters substantial competition from a wide variety of entities in both of its business lines, most of which is from companies which are better capitalized than the Company. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no employees.
