The company has entered into licensing agreements with Denise Richards, Carmen Electra, and Holly Sonders to use their name, image, likeness, and endorsement of menus.
 
A virtual restaurant is a food service business that serves customers exclusively by delivery based on phone orders or online food ordering. It is a separate food vendor entity that operates out of an existing restaurant's kitchen. Virtual restaurants can economize by not having a full-service restaurant premise with a storefront and dining room by occupying cheaper real estate.
 
The company is developing concepts and menus to license to existing restaurants and expects to collect revenues from subscriptions to its menus and concepts and ingredient sales.
 
The Company intends to generate revenue by selling subscriptions to menus it has developed or are presently developing. Restaurants will pay a monthly subscription fee to carry our celebrity-branded menus. Furthermore, the Company will be entitled to an additional 5% of the gross sales of the Company’s menu items from restaurants that carry the Company’s brands.
 
Example: Restaurant X pays a monthly fee of $500 per menu to the Company. The Company will also be entitled to 5% of gross sales of that menu. The Company has three separate licensing agreements for each celebrity.
 
License Agreement #1- Carmen Electra

Competition
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. We compete with other restaurants on the taste, quality, and price of our food offerings. Additionally, we compete with other restaurants in service, ambiance, location, and overall customer experience. We believe that we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and quick casual establishments, and to a lesser extent, with quick-service restaurants in general. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional, or local chains, and many have more significant financial and marketing resources than we do.
