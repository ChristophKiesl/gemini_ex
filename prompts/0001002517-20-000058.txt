Item 1.Business
Overview
Nuance Communications, Inc. ("We", "Nuance", or the "Company") is a technology pioneer and market leader in conversational artificial intelligence ("AI") and ambient clinical intelligence. We deliver intuitive solutions that understand, analyze, and respond to people - amplifying their ability to help others with increased productivity and security. We work with thousands of organizations globally across healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, government, and retail - to create stronger relationships and better experiences for their customers and workforce. We offer our customers a wide range of products and services, including clinical documentation, solutions for clinicians, radiologists and care teams, as well as intelligent customer engagement and security biometric solutions for leading brands. In addition, our solutions increasingly utilize our innovations in AI, including cognitive sciences and machine learning to create smarter, more natural experiences with technology. Using advanced analytics and algorithms, our technologies create personalized experiences and transform the way people interact with information and the technology around them. We market and sell our solutions and technologies around the world directly through a dedicated sales force and a global network of resellers, including system integrators, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, distributors, hardware vendors, telecommunications carriers and e-commerce websites.
We are a global organization steeped in research and development ("R&D"). We have approximately 1,600 language scientists, developers, and engineers dedicated to continually refining our technologies and advancing our portfolio to better meet our customers’ diverse and changing needs. As of September 30, 2020, we had operations and sales force in 28 countries. Our corporate headquarters is in Burlington, Massachusetts, and our international headquarters is in Dublin, Ireland. In fiscal year 2020, our revenue was approximately $1.5 billion.
In connection with our ongoing comprehensive portfolio and business review, during the first quarter of 2021, we announced our strategic plan to sell our medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group. These businesses provide critical support to healthcare organizations, and upon the closing of the sale, Nuance will be both a minority stakeholder and business partner committed to the success of the new business, named DeliverHealth Solutions. 
As a result, we expect the results of medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses to be included within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations, and the related assets and liabilities to be classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. 
Our Strategy 
With the sale of our Imaging segment, the spin-off of our Automotive segment, the exit of our Mobile Operator Services business and the wind-down of Devices, as well as the anticipated sale of our medical transcription and EHR go-live businesses, we are

positioned to be a simpler and more growth-oriented company, which enables us to prioritize and execute our conversational AI strategies within Healthcare and Enterprise. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Transitioning to and expansion of our Healthcare cloud-based offerings. We are transitioning our Healthcare solutions to the cloud, enabling us to shift our revenue mix to a more subscription-based, higher-value recurring model. We have established Nuance as a cloud platform in all our strategic solutions within Healthcare. During fiscal year 2020, we continued to make significant progress migrating our customers to the cloud with Dragon Medical One ("DMO") PowerScribe One, and CDE One. We launched new cloud solutions, such as cloud-based Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation ("CAPD") solutions, and Nuance® Dragon Ambient eXperience™ (DAX™), an ambient clinical intelligence ("ACI") solution. We have created a go-to-market approach that aligns sales compensation to our cloud models, and have enabled our channel to sell Dragon Medical cloud. We also launched new Dragon Medical cloud offerings in certain international markets, including France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Finland.


• | Expanding our Intelligent Engagement portfolio in Enterprise, with a focus on cloud. While we maintain leadership in interactive voice response ("IVR") offerings, we have increased our focus on Intelligent Engagement growth opportunities, including digital, voice, and Security and Biometrics solutions. We expanded the cloud-native stack with the roll-out of Nuance Mix™ and Intelligent Engagement Services for Conversational AI, Messaging, and Agent AI. We continue to grow our market share of Nuance Gatekeeper, a cloud-native voice biometrics and authentication solution. These solutions offer customers more flexible integration with third-party systems and the ability to deploy across hosted, public, or private clouds. It gives large enterprises flexible deployment options while making Nuance technology available to smaller organizations via the cloud model.


• | Accelerating our innovation activities. We are accelerating investment in research and development ("R&D"), focusing on new AI products that deliver additional value to our existing customer base. In Healthcare we continued to expand the number of specialties supported by Nuance DAX and launched Nuance DAX for telehealth. Building on our Dragon Medical One platform, we offer CAPD solutions for sub-specialties, including surgical, cardiovascular, pediatrics, and the emergency department, as well as new capabilities for the clinical documentation specialists through CDE One. Building on our large radiology installed base, we offer a suite of additional offerings for image sharing, communication, workflow orchestration, incidental findings follow-up, and the AI marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging in Healthcare. In Enterprise, building on our strong footprint in the Fortune 100 with IVR, we increase revenue, cost savings, and customer satisfaction through the addition of digital offerings and security and biometrics solutions for a seamless omnichannel experience. Enterprises have a choice of deployment whether they leverage our world-class professional services team or leverage Nuance Mix, an open enterprise-grade, SaaS tooling suite for creating advanced conversational experiences that power virtual assistants and IVR using Nuance’s industry-leading and cloud-agnostic conversational AI. 


• | Expanding our go-to-market presence. We are increasing sales coverage in new markets and developing solutions to build on our platform approach to increase our customer lifetime value. In Healthcare, we are pursuing under-served markets, including community hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and surgery centers. We also launched new solutions for specialty areas such as pediatrics, the emergency department, cardiovascular, and surgical. In Enterprise, we are expanding our Intelligent Engagement solutions into our existing IVR customer base and delivering new rapid AI development tools that will allow us to increase our penetration into mid-market accounts.


• | Expanding internationally. In Healthcare, we continue to expand our international presence in the U.K., France, DACH region, Nordics, Australia, and Canada with a growing direct sales force and new offerings. We launched new Dragon Medical cloud offerings in certain international markets, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. In Enterprise, we continue to expand our international presence in the U.K., France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Canada with expanded Intelligent Engagement offerings and sales focus.


• | Growing through targeted acquisitions and strategic investments. While organic growth is our priority, we also expect to selectively and opportunistically pursue acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies that advance the strategies described above.

Segments
As of September 30, 2020, we had three reportable segments: Healthcare, Enterprise, and Other.
