Item 1. Business 
Overview
 We are one of the world’s leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers. Accordingly, we believe we are well positioned to continue to expand our market share and sustain margins in the growing Phase I-IV CRO market.
 We were founded in 1992 by Dr. August J. Troendle, an industry pioneer, as a Phase II-IV focused CRO with a strong, scientifically-driven and disciplined operating model, and we continue today as a founder-led enterprise with Dr. Troendle retaining a significant ownership stake in Medpace. Throughout our 25-year history, we have grown almost exclusively organically, with our core founding members having been integrally involved in developing and instilling our differentiated culture and operating philosophy across our company. We focus on conducting clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Oncology, Endocrinology, Central Nervous System, or CNS, and Antiviral and Anti-infective, AVAI, as well as therapeutic expertise in Medical Devices. Our global platform includes approximately 2,500 employees across 35 countries, providing our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge.
 Our singular focus on executing our disciplined, full-service operating model is a core tenet of our differentiated approach. Our operating model entails partnering with our customers from the beginning of the clinical trial process and holistically navigating all subsequent components of the process. This approach differs from other leading CROs that provide functional or partial outsourcing services as a core component of their business. We believe our full-service approach allows us to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers. By clearly communicating and aligning our expectations with those of our customers at the beginning of an engagement, we develop a trusted relationship where our customers typically grant us greater control over the clinical trial process. This results in greater accountability on our part and, we believe, more consistent delivery of our services. We believe our partnering approach, coupled with our full-service, scientifically-driven model, ensures efficient and high-quality trial execution, limits changes in the scope of trials and enables timely completion of trials.
 We focus on providing clinical development solutions primarily to companies that recognize the benefits of utilizing our full-service outsourcing model. We believe our model is particularly attractive to small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies, which seek specialized capabilities and infrastructure required for complex and global clinical trials, including therapeutic expertise, insightful protocol design, project feasibility assessment and timely and high-quality trial execution. We expect that outsourced development expenditures for small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies will continue to outpace outsourced development expenditures for the broader biopharmaceutical market. We believe we can expand our market share with this customer segment given our continued strategic focus and the attractiveness of our model to these companies. Furthermore, as the clinical development and regulatory processes grow increasingly more global and complex, we believe large pharmaceutical companies will increasingly recognize the benefits of our disciplined, full-service operating model. For the Successor year ended December 31, 2016, we generated 64.8%, 23.0% and 12.2% of our net service revenue from small biopharmaceutical companies, mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies, respectively.

Our Market
 Clinical Development Process
 Before a new drug can be commercialized, it often must undergo extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory review to verify safety and efficacy. CROs provide a comprehensive range of product development services for Phase I-IV clinical trials. These clinical trials are separated into distinct phases in order to thoroughly evaluate the product. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2015 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile, a trade group publication, indicates that from drug discovery through approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, developing a new medicine takes at least 10 years and costs approximately $2.6 billion.
 The following graphic, based on data presented in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2013 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile and 2015 Biopharmaceutical Research Industry Profile, industry trade group publications, illustrates the various stages and typical timeline of the clinical development process:
 Stages of Clinical Development
 
Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsource product development services to CROs in order to efficiently and cost-effectively manage the clinical development process and obtain regulatory approval and reach the market in as timely a manner as possible. Historically, outsourcing was driven primarily by the need for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce cost and maintain focus on core competencies, or to provide services or capabilities that these companies did not have internally. In recent years, the role of a CRO has evolved and CROs are now increasingly an integral component of the product development process, providing their customers with regulatory and therapeutic expertise, complex clinical trial design, broader geographic coverage, access to diverse population pools and consistent and reliable data systems and procedures.
CRO Market Size
 We estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge, that total global biopharmaceutical clinical development expenditures were approximately $100 billion in 2014. We further estimate, based on these industry sources, that the portion of these expenditures attributable to Phase I-IV clinical development services was $44 billion, of which we estimate $23 billion was outsourced. In addition, based on these industry sources, we estimate the CRO market will experience a CAGR of approximately 6% from 2014 through 2019, growing to approximately $31 billion in 2019, as a result of increasing biopharmaceutical clinical development expenditures combined with increased outsourcing penetration.
 - 7 -

CRO Market Trends
 Increasing Development Expenditures. We estimate that biopharmaceutical development expenditures will grow from approximately $100 billion in 2014 to approximately $114 billion in 2019, representing a CAGR of approximately 3%. We believe that the growth in development expenditures is primarily attributed to the heightened pace of biopharmaceutical innovation, pressure on companies to replenish pipelines with new therapies, the favorable regulatory environment and the significant amount of capital raised by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies during the last several years. There were 13,718 drugs in the development pipeline in January 2016, as identified by Citeline Pharma’s R&D Annual Review 2016, an industry publication, which was an increase of approximately 41% compared to the 9,737 that were in development in 2010. In line with the significant capital raised by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, based upon financial data available from FactSet Research Systems Inc., a provider of financial information, as of September 30, 2015, the companies comprising the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, or NBI, had approximately $109.3 billion in cash available to support ongoing clinical development. This figure represents a 24.7% increase above the cash balance of approximately $87.6 billion held by the companies comprising the NBI as of December 31, 2014, and a 111.5% increase above the cash balance of approximately $51.7 billion held by companies comprising the NBI as of December 31, 2010.
 Increasing Outsourcing Penetration. Outsourcing penetration is the percentage of biopharmaceutical clinical development costs that are outsourced to CROs. We estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge, that approximately 52% of Phase I-IV clinical development expenditures were outsourced in 2014. Driven by increased clinical trial complexity, the need for regulatory and therapeutic expertise and global access to patient populations, we expect outsourcing penetration will reach approximately 62% in 2019.
 Pressures Facing Biopharmaceutical Industry. The biopharmaceutical industry continues to experience significant challenges, including regulatory and pricing pressures resulting from healthcare reform, intensifying generic competition, pipeline failures and the need for continued innovation. In order to combat these challenges and maintain revenue growth and operating margins, biopharmaceutical companies increasingly seek clinical expertise and seek to outsource clinical services to CROs to accelerate clinical development and maximize commercialization success.
 Increasing Clinical Trial Complexity. Clinical trial design and structure have become increasingly complex based on regulatory agency sophistication, more complicated protocols and a growing focus by biopharmaceutical companies on developing new cutting-edge drug therapies. For example, based on the data available in the FDA’s Orphan Drug Product designation database, the number of orphan drug designations granted increased by nearly 75% from 190 in 2012 to 333 in 2016. This growing complexity brings new challenges in study feasibility, site selection, patient recruitment and retention due to the rarity of orphan diseases, which globally may only have hundreds or thousands of patients. Additionally, measures of clinical trial complexity significantly increased over the last decade, with the mean number of procedures per protocol increasing by 68% as indicated by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent non-profit research group. We believe full-service CROs with noted therapeutic leadership, full-service clinical operations, a proprietary technology platform, strategic regulatory guidance and integrated laboratories are well suited to successfully support these types of studies.
 Small and Mid-Sized Biopharmaceutical Segment
 We believe small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies are important to the continued growth of the CRO industry. These companies are primary centers of innovation, developing new, cutting-edge therapies for niche or previously untreatable diseases, which frequently require sophisticated clinical trials. These companies have limited ability to conduct global clinical trials independently, and as a result, they typically seek a strategic partner that can provide the therapeutic experience and infrastructure required to deliver timely completion of complex, global clinical trials. We estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge, that outsourced development expenditures for these companies will grow at a CAGR of 10% from 2014 to 2019, outpacing the estimated overall biopharmaceutical market CAGR of 6%. In 2014, we estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge, that small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately 69% of their development expenditures, representing an estimated addressable CRO market of approximately $7 billion, which we estimate, based on these same sources, will increase to approximately 76%, representing an estimated addressable CRO market of approximately $11 billion in 2019.

Biopharmaceutical companies have a variety of options for raising money to support the funding of their drug development, including raising private equity, raising public equity and partnering with large biopharmaceutical companies to jointly develop drug candidates. Many of these companies are well-funded, having raised approximately $232 billion of capital in the aggregate, including funding from investments from corporate partners, in 2014 and 2015, representing a 110% increase over the approximately $110 billion raised in 2012 and 2013, as identified by BioWorld, a biopharmaceutical news source. We believe the level of capital raised for small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies over the last few years is sufficient to fund significant clinical trial activity for these companies going forward. We believe that companies that are progressing with good results through a clinical trial will be able to continue to fund those clinical trials with available cash and will have additional avenues to fund these programs as necessary, including partnerships with large biopharmaceutical companies.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on positive trends in the CRO industry based on our key competitive strengths set forth below:
 Disciplined and Integrated Full-Service Model. Since our founding in 1992, we have focused on building and executing our disciplined, full-service operating model to provide clinical development services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. At the center of our differentiated operating model is our full-service focused, end-to-end approach to delivering clinical development services. We partner with customers from the beginning of the clinical trial process and holistically navigate all subsequent components of the process. While many CROs engage in functional or partial outsourcing services as a significant component of their business model, we take a disciplined approach and do not typically provide such piecemeal services. We believe that a full-service approach delivers greater efficiency, better quality and, ultimately, higher value for our customers.
In executing our operating model, we have demonstrated durable success across multiple therapeutic areas. We embed therapeutic leads, each of whom holds a Doctor of Philosophy, or Ph.D., a Doctor of Medicine, or M.D., or other doctorate level degrees into every aspect of the project, and our customers rely on this expertise throughout the entire clinical process. By clearly communicating and aligning our expectations with those of our customers at the beginning of an engagement, we tend to develop a close working relationship that is built on a level of trust that results in us being granted greater control over the clinical trial process. We have developed and consistently utilize effective standard operating procedures, or SOPs, that we believe result in high-quality and timely clinical development outcomes for our customers. Our operating model utilizes our proprietary ClinTrak clinical trial management software, or ClinTrak, which is customized and streamlined to our SOPs. We house our key decision-makers, our internally-developed technology and our corporate infrastructure in our corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. This centralization allows us to maintain highly integrated, standardized and flexible operations, while preserving our operating philosophy and extending our global reach, resulting in a disciplined business model and attractive financial performance.
 High-Science Approach with Deep Therapeutic Expertise. Customers generally seek a CRO with extensive therapeutic expertise in their focus areas. Our therapeutic expertise encompasses areas that are among the largest, most complex and fastest growing in pharmaceutical development, including Oncology, Cardiology, Metabolic Disease, Endocrinology, CNS and AVAI, as well as Medical Devices. Our core therapeutic expertise covers the therapeutic areas where a majority of all drugs are currently in development, as identified by Citeline Pharma R&D Annual Review 2016, an industry publication. 
 We leverage the insights of our senior leaders who have specific therapeutic expertise to employ a high-science approach to our projects. Because we believe that therapeutic expertise plays a significant role in CRO selection, we focus heavily on hiring and training our therapeutic leads in order to maximize therapeutic insights to inform clinical trial design and execution. In clinical trial execution, our therapeutic leads are embedded into every aspect of the process from start to finish. Our scientific and medical staff is fundamental to delivering high-quality trial execution and enabling timely completion of complex processes.

Attractive and Diversified Customer Base. We have a strong track record of serving our core customer base of small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies, which we believe represents an attractive growth opportunity. We believe outsourced development expenditures in our core customer base will outpace the growth of the broader biopharmaceutical market. While we estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge, that the overall biopharmaceutical market will grow its outsourced development expenditures for Phase I-IV clinical development and laboratory services at a 6% CAGR from 2014 to 2019, we expect the small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical outsourced development expenditures will grow at a 10% CAGR during this period. Small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies, many of which are now well capitalized, have firmly established themselves at the forefront of medical innovation and the search for new therapies for previously untreatable diseases, which require increasingly complex clinical trials. CROs are integral to the clinical development process for these customers, providing regulatory and therapeutic expertise, complex clinical trial design, broader geographic coverage, access to diverse population pools and consistent and reliable data systems and procedures, since these customers often lack the infrastructure and global breadth required for efficient and high-quality trial execution.
 In addition, we have a highly diversified customer base comprising many of the largest global biopharmaceutical companies, as well as high-growth small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. For the Successor year ended December 31, 2016, we generated 64.8%, 23.0% and 12.2% of our net service revenue from small biopharmaceutical companies, mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies, respectively. For the Successor years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our largest customer accounted for 6.0% and 6.9% of our net service revenue, respectively, and our top 10 customers represented 37.0% and 39.9% of our net service revenue, respectively. For more information about our largest customer, see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” of Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 14 “Related Party Transactions” to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Partner of Choice for Biopharmaceutical Customers. Based on our extensive operating history and therapeutic experience, we believe that we have established a reputation as a partner of choice to our core customer segment of small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. Acting as incubators of pharmaceutical development, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies are responsible for a number of innovative drug candidates currently being developed to address unmet medical needs. Many of these drug candidates are being developed for niche and severe indications with relatively small patient populations, which require increasingly complex clinical trials. These biopharmaceutical customers, sometimes new to the clinical development process, seek to partner with us based on our differentiated approach and expertise to execute trials in a timely and efficient manner. The Avoca Group’s 2011 Avoca Survey on Clinical Outsourcing Practices, a survey of over 100 biopharmaceutical companies, indicates that 48% of pharmaceutical companies with annual revenue over $1.5 billion, 51% of biopharmaceutical companies with annual revenue between $100 million and $1.5 billion, and 64% of biopharmaceutical companies with annual revenue under $100 million prefer medium-sized, full-service CROs, defined as the top fifteen CROs by revenue excluding the top five CROs by revenue, based on service and outsourcing experience. Of this same group, only 40% of large pharmaceutical companies, 24% of mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies and 7% of small biopharmaceutical companies prefer large, full-service CROs, defined as the top five CROs by revenue. We do not believe that we are among the top five CROs by revenue based on publicly available information. We believe we are viewed as a strategic and trusted partner by these customers given our full-service approach, disciplined operating model and significant therapeutic expertise. As a result, our customers often grant us significant autonomy in executing clinical trials for their most valued assets.
 Global Platform with Scalable Infrastructure. We believe that we are one of the leading CROs with the scale and therapeutic expertise necessary to effectively conduct global clinical trials. We began our disciplined international expansion in 2004 and have since increased the breadth and depth of our international footprint significantly, with approximately 45.1% of our clinical operations employees located outside of North America as of December 31, 2016. We now offer our services through a highly skilled staff of approximately 2,500 employees across 35 countries as of December 31, 2016. As clinical trials become increasingly global, our platform provides our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations, as well as local regulatory expertise and market knowledge, which can reduce the time and cost of these trials, while also helping to optimize the commercialization potential for new therapies.

In addition to leveraging our operating model, we intend to continue to selectively hire employees to strengthen and expand our expertise in high-growth therapeutic areas, including Oncology, CNS and AVAI. We methodically look to hire employees early in their careers and thoroughly train them to excel in our disciplined operating model, while instilling within them our corporate culture and philosophy. We apply this same training and standardization globally in order to maintain consistency and minimize inefficiencies in our operations. From 2012 through 2016, we successfully organically grew our business from approximately 1,000 employees to approximately 2,500 employees and organically grew our net service revenue from $177.4 million to $370.6 million. We intend to continue to utilize our disciplined organic growth model and robust cash flows to drive future revenue growth.
 Continue to Sustain Industry-Leading Margins. We intend to continue to maintain industry-leading margins (compared to our public competitors) while growing organically. We believe the key to sustaining margins is through the execution of our disciplined operating philosophy and full-service business model. Furthermore, we intend to continue to develop our centralized operations at our corporate headquarters in order to maintain standardization and consistency across our global operations. We have a proven track record of achieving strong margins while significantly scaling our business and expanding globally.
 Leverage Our Experience and Reputation in the Attractive, High-Growth Clinical Development Market. Our customers value the knowledge and therapeutic expertise we have developed from a long history of successfully executing clinical trials. Given the rapid emergence of new therapies and resulting evolution of commercial priorities among many biopharmaceutical companies, we believe consistently maintaining the necessary infrastructure and human capital required to retain clinical and therapeutic expertise internally is not the most cost-effective solution for these companies. As the regulatory landscape adapts to greater clinical trial complexity, we believe that biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly engage CROs with the requisite global resources as well as therapeutic and regulatory expertise to assume full responsibility of the clinical trial process. We estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports and management’s knowledge that Phase I-IV clinical development outsourcing penetration for biopharmaceutical companies will increase from 52% in 2014 to 62% in 2019. Based on our successful execution of clinical trials across many therapeutic areas in multiple countries, as well as our focus on closely partnering with our customers through all aspects of the clinical trial process, we believe we have developed a strong reputation in the industry as a leading CRO. We believe that this reputation positions us to continue capturing additional share of the attractive, high-growth clinical development market as the industry increasingly recognizes the benefits of our operating model.
 - 11 -

Deepen Existing and Develop New Relationships with Our Core Customer Segment. We look to continue to deepen our long-standing relationships with existing customers through new engagements and expand our relationships with new small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical customers. As a strategic partner of choice, we clearly communicate and align our expectations with our customers at the beginning of an engagement to develop a close working relationship that is built on trust. We believe this trust, supported by our high-quality execution and frequent dialogue with our customers’ key decision makers, positions us to be awarded additional business in existing and new therapies, allowing us to grow alongside our customers and leading to an increasingly significant, and growing, contribution from repeat business.
 While our successes to date have built a substantial customer base, we believe that there is opportunity for continued growth and penetration in our core customer segment. We place our therapeutic leads alongside our sales team to actively participate in the procurement of new customers whose portfolios align with our therapeutic expertise, which we believe further differentiates us from our competitors. 
 Pursue Selective and Complementary Bolt-On Acquisitions. We intend to evaluate selective targeted acquisitions to augment our organic growth and expand our current capabilities and service offerings. Our acquisition strategy is driven by our comprehensive commitment to serve customer needs. While we are continuously assessing the market for attractive opportunities, we do so selectively with a focus on targeting opportunities to acquire and integrate complementary and strategic, non-transformative acquisitions within the CRO sector in order to strengthen our competitive position and provide enhanced value to our customers.
 Position Ourselves to Increase Our Presence Among Large Pharmaceutical Companies as These Customers Adopt and Appreciate the Full-Service Approach. Given the growing pressures large pharmaceutical companies are facing, including complex clinical development and regulatory processes, these companies seek solutions beyond simply outsourcing clinical development. These companies are increasingly seeking strategic partnerships that provide more holistic clinical development services and also the expertise that CRO partners offer. We have witnessed a noticeable shift by large pharmaceutical companies away from lower-value, functional outsourcing service providers toward full-service CROs. Given our differentiated operating model, we believe larger pharmaceutical companies will be increasingly appreciative of our proven approach to clinical development and expertise, and we intend to actively market the strength and depth of our services to these companies.

 Net New Business Awards and Backlog
 New business awards represent the value of anticipated future net service revenue that has been awarded during the period that is recognized in backlog. This value is recognized upon the signing of a contract or receipt of a written pre-contract confirmation from a customer that confirms an agreement in principle on budget and scope. New business awards also include contract amendments, or changes in scope, where the customer has provided written authorization for changes in budget and scope or has approved us to perform additional work as of the measurement date. Awards may not be recognized as backlog after consideration of a number of factors, including whether (i) the relevant net service revenue is expected only after a pending regulatory hurdle, which might result in cancellation of the study, (ii) the customer funding needed for commencement of the study is not believed to have been secured or (iii) study timelines are uncertain or not well defined timeline. In addition, study amounts that extend beyond a three-year timeline are not included in backlog. The number and amount of new business awards can vary significantly from period to period, and an award’s contractual duration can range from several months to several years based on customer and project specifications.

Cancellations arise in the normal course of business and are reflected when we receive written confirmation from the customer to cease work on a contractual agreement. The majority of our customers can terminate our contracts without cause upon 30 days’ notice. Similar to new business awards, the number and amount of cancellations can vary significantly period over period due to timing of customer correspondence and study-specific circumstances. 
 Net new business awards represent gross new business awards received in a period offset by total cancellations in that period. Net new business awards were $427.0 million, $359.5 million, $231.9 million and $97.2 million for the Successor years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Successor nine month period ended December 31, 2014 and the Predecessor three month period ended March 31, 2014, respectively. 
 Backlog represents anticipated future net service revenue from net new business awards that have commenced, but have not been completed. Reported backlog will fluctuate based on new business awards, changes in scope to existing contracts, cancellations, net service revenue recognition on existing contracts and foreign exchange adjustments from non-U.S. dollar denominated backlog. As of December 31, 2016, our backlog increased by $54.2 million, or 12.6%, to $483.9 million compared to $429.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Our backlog as of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014 was approximately $394.0 and $386.0, respectively. Included within backlog as of December 31, 2016 is approximately $265 million to $275 million that we expect to convert to net service revenue in 2017, with the remainder expected to convert to net service revenue in years after 2017. 
 Backlog and net new business award metrics may not be reliable indicators of our future period net service revenue as they are subject to a variety of factors that may cause material fluctuations from period to period. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the scope of projects, cancellations and duration and timing of services provided. No assurance can be given that we will be able to realize the net service revenue that is included in backlog. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our backlog may not convert to net service revenue at our historical conversion rates,” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—New Business Awards, Cancellations and Backlog” of Parts I and II, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
 Sales and Marketing
 We employ an integrated sales and marketing team to sell our services to biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies.
 We have an experienced and highly trained global team of professional business development representatives and business development support staff focused on securing business from both new and existing customers, through a consultative and strategic sales approach. We embed our medical and scientific experts from the beginning of the sales process when we first engage potential customers, and they remain embedded across the lifecycle of the sale and throughout the life of the project, program or partnership.
 As part of its sales strategy, our business development team focuses on a customer segmentation model. Our team targets and engages customers in our addressable market, matches customer characteristics with therapeutic fit and maintains a mindset of full-service outsourcing. Our structured and disciplined approach facilitates strong account evaluation, which results in increased focus by the sales team, the development of effective and productive territories, the management of sales force effectiveness and the creation of a process whereby both marketing and sales operate under the same guiding principles.
 We are able to consult collaboratively with our customers and help optimize timely completion of their clinical trials and programs, in part, because we engage our therapeutic experts from the beginning of the sales process and involve our regulatory affairs experts and highly trained operations team throughout the clinical trial process. Our sales team is then able to take the study design, regulatory plan and execution plan discussed up front and carry that through to the proposal and provide a final concept during one-on-one customer discussions and final CRO evaluations.
 - 16 -

Our marketing team supports the business development function in three key areas, generating brand awareness through customized campaigns and web-site development, conference planning and lead generation through market research and business intelligence analysis. The marketing team is set up in two mirrored teams, one team to address our therapeutic strategy and tactics, and the second team to monitor and address market environment across our lines of business. All of our sales and marketing data are housed within a third party customer relationship management tool that provides us the analytics we need to make sales planning and sales management decisions.
 Segment and Geographic Information
 We operate in one reportable segment and have operations in the North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. See Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our reportable segment. See Note 16 “Entity Wide Disclosures” to our consolidated financial statements for geographic information including revenues and long-lived assets attributed to our country of domicile and foreign countries (including any individual foreign country if material).  
Competition
 We compete primarily against other full-service CROs as well as services provided by in-house research and development, or R&D, departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Our major CRO competitors include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, ICON plc, INC Research Holdings, Inc., inVentiv Health, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC, PRA Health Sciences, Inc., Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. and numerous specialty and regional CROs.
 We generally compete on the basis of a number of factors, including experience within specific therapeutic areas, quality of staff and services, reliability, range of provided services, ability to recruit principal investigators and patients into studies expeditiously, ability to organize and manage large-scale, global clinical trials, global presence with strategically located facilities, speed to completion, price and overall value. We believe we compete effectively with our competitors across these factors, particularly due to our full-service operating model, our deep therapeutic expertise in areas that are among the largest, most complex and fastest growing in pharmaceutical development, our global platform and our experienced and committed management team. However, some of our competitors have greater financial resources and a wider range of service offerings over a greater geographic area than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to these competitors.
 The CRO industry remains fragmented, with several hundred smaller, narrowly focused service providers and a small number of full-service companies with global capabilities. We believe there are significant barriers to others becoming a global provider offering a broad range of services and products including the cost and experience necessary to develop strong therapeutic areas, expertise to manage complex clinical programs, infrastructure to support large global programs, ability to deliver high-quality services and expertise required to prepare regulatory submissions in numerous jurisdictions.
 Government Regulation
 Development of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices
 The development of drugs, biologics and medical devices is highly regulated in the United States and other countries. Our services are subject to varying regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the pre-clinical and clinical trial process. In the United States, the FDA has primary authority to regulate these activities, in addition to the approval process, and the subsequent manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing for these products, which are the responsibility of our customers. Before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must often undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials. In the United States, these trials must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations, and other federal and state requirements that require the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to approval. The FDA has similar authority and requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. Before a human clinical trial may begin in the United States, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an Investigational 
 - 17 -

New Drug Application, or IND, with the FDA, which contains, among things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturer information and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. Each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an IRB, which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial for which the IRB has responsibility. The FDA and IRB receive reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if, among other things, an unreasonable risk is presented to patients or if the design of the trial is insufficient to meet its stated objective. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be made publicly available on the federal government website, www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 In the United States, GCP regulations govern the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. In order to comply with GCP and other requirements, we must, among other things:
  
☐ | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain IRB review and approval and supervision of the clinical trials by an independent review board or ethics committee;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | obtain a favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
--+-------------------------------------------


☐ | monitor drug or biologic accountability at clinical research sites; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | verify that principal investigators and clinical trial staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations may or may not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of clinical trial pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other clinical trial materials. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and requirements may vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including countries outside the EU and countries in Asia and Latin America where we operate or where our customers may intend to apply for marketing authorization. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States also may be subject to FDA regulation if the clinical trials are conducted pursuant to an IND or an Investigational Device Exemption for a product candidate that will seek FDA approval or clearance. In addition, clinical trial sponsors follow ICH E6 guidelines as a principle for GCP.
 The clinical trial customer and the parties conducting the clinical trials share in responsibilities to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. Many of the functions we regularly perform in the conduct of clinical trials subject us directly to regulations (e.g., compliance with GCP), and in some circumstances, we will take on legal and regulatory responsibility either through a transfer of obligations to us from our clinical trial customers or our acting as local legal representative for certain of our clinical trial customers. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with certain regulations may also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical trial, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational 
 - 18 -

products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, government regulations and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be adversely affected” of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted SOPs that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated requirements.
 Health Information Privacy
 The confidentiality of personal health information, including patient-specific information collected during clinical trials, is heavily regulated in the United States and other countries. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, including the Privacy and Security Rules, or collectively, HIPAA, that govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual’s rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. HIPAA applies to “covered entities,” which include certain types of healthcare providers, as well as service providers to covered entities which access protected health information, known as “business associates.” Two of our subsidiaries, Medpace Clinical Pharmacology, LLC and C-MARC, LLC, are covered entities under HIPAA. Further, many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are also directly subject to HIPAA as covered entities. There are instances where we may be considered a business associate of a covered entity investigator, and we have signed business associate agreements with some investigators. If we are determined to be a business associate, we would be directly liable for any breaches of protected health information and other HIPAA violations. We are also liable contractually under any business associate agreements we have signed with covered entities. In addition, we are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act and privacy legislation in the EU under the 95/46/EC Privacy Directive on the protection and free movement of personal data, as replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation from early 2018 onwards. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Industry—Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings” of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health Industry Arrangements
 The conduct of pre-clinical and clinical trials may be subject to laws and regulations that are intended to prevent the misuse of government healthcare program funding. In the United States, these laws include, among others, the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting or causing the submission of false statements or improper claims for government healthcare program payments; and the Anti-Kickback statute, which prohibits paying, offering to pay or receiving payment with the intent to induce the referral of services or items that are covered under a federal healthcare program. Violations of these laws and regulations may incur administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.
Employee Safety and Workplace Conditions
 Most of our employees are office based and subject to health and safety regulations covering offices, with which we comply. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, which apply to our clinic and laboratories. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations with respect to our laboratories in Belgium, Singapore and China.
 - 19 -

Environmental Regulation and Liability
 We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety in the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and medical wastes. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations for contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites), the off-site disposal of hazardous substances and for personal injuries or property damage arising from exposure to hazardous materials from our operations. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we currently have no liabilities under such environmental requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Medpace and ClinTrak. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2016 we had approximately 2,500 employees worldwide, with approximately 66% in North America, 29% in Europe, 4% in Asia/Pacific and 1% in South America and Africa. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement specific to our company. We believe our overall relations with our employees are good. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately 2,000 and 1,700 employees, respectively.
 The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel, particularly for those with Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent degrees or training, is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. We also believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers. In addition, our disciplined and centralized approach to hiring and training has fostered, and we believe will continue to foster, strong employee loyalty and a low turnover rate.
 Liability and Insurance
 We may be liable to our customers for any failure to conduct their clinical trials properly according to the agreed-upon protocol and contract. If we fail to conduct a clinical trial properly in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures, we may have to repeat a clinical trial or a particular portion of the services at our expense, reimburse the customer for the cost of the services and/or pay additional damages.
 - 20 -

At our Phase I clinic, we study the effects of drugs on healthy volunteers. In addition, in our clinical business we, on behalf of our customers, contract with physicians who render professional services, including the administration of the substance being tested to participants in clinical trials, many of whom are seriously ill and are at great risk of further illness or death as a result of factors other than their participation in a trial. As a result, we could be held liable for bodily injury, death, pain and suffering, loss of consortium or other personal injury claims and medical expenses arising from a clinical trial. In addition, we sometimes engage the services of vendors necessary for the conduct of a clinical trial, such as laboratories or medical diagnostic specialists. Because these vendors are engaged as subcontractors, we are responsible for their performance and may be held liable for damages if the subcontractors fail to perform in the manner specified in their contract.
 To reduce our potential liability, and as a requirement of the GCP regulations, informed consent is required from each volunteer and patient. In addition, our customers provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. These indemnities generally do not, however, protect us against certain of our own actions such as those involving negligence or misconduct. Our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is not indemnified, that is outside the scope of an indemnity or where the indemnity, although applicable, is not honored in accordance with its terms.
 We maintain errors, omissions and professional liability insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate. This insurance provides coverage for vicarious liability due to negligence of the investigators who contract with us, as well as claims by our customers that a clinical trial was compromised due to an error or omission by us. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.
