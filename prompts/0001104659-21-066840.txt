ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on June 24, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated for the purpose of partnering with founders, operators, and entrepreneurs to build great companies and advance the Innovation Economy by offering an alternate path to the public markets, which we will achieve by effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We consummated our initial public offering on August 20, 2020.
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on industries that complement our founding team’s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our founding team to identify and acquire a business, focusing on the technology industry.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on August 17, 2020. On August 20, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 21,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), which includes 1,500,000 Units sold pursuant to the underwriter’s exercise of its over- allotment option, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $215,000,000. Each Unit consists of one Public Share and one-fourth of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”)
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 3,150,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $2.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor (the “Private Placement”), generating gross proceeds of $6,300,000.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, an amount of $215,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, which was invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earliest of: (i) the completion of an initial business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders, as described below.
 
Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a business combination. The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing rules require that the initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). We will only complete a business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had not commenced any operations. All activities from inception to December 31, 2020, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a business combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

We will provide the holders of the Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the business combination, either (i) in connection with a meeting of shareholders called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (initially to be $10.00 per Public Share), including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations as described in the prospectus. The per-share amount to be distributed to the Public Shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions that we will pay to the underwriters.

Also, in connection with Merger Agreement, the Company entered into certain related agreements including Subscription Agreements, Sponsor Support Agreement, Shareholder Support Agreement. For more information on the proposed business combination (the “Proposed Transaction”) and the agreements entered into in connection therewith, see the Company’s announcement and the related agreements filed in the our Current Report on Form 8-K on February 24, 2021.
Business Strategy
 
We believe that talent is evenly distributed across the globe, but opportunity is not. We are dedicated to finding bold founders, operators, and inventors who are committed to building an enduring business and would benefit from the democratized and open source nature of public markets as well as working with our team of founders and advisors.
 
We have a proven record of success in the technology industry as founders, investors, operators, executives, and board members and are confident that we can partner with other founders and leaders and provide support to build and scale a category-defining business. We believe we possess the following tools to drive value creation at a company:
 
Experience recognizing key technology trends: Our founding team has demonstrated consistent prowess in identifying and investing in major technological trends such as the proliferation of online payments in the financial industry, the sharing economy and its impacts on mobility and lodging, and the power of the Internet in enabling online real estate transactions. In some instances, our team’s identification and investment in a company, believed to be poised to benefit from an identified technological trend pre- dated revenue, representing some of the earliest outside capital to support business growth. We believe our experiences and track record of identifying and participating in key technology trends provides us with a unique advantage in the successful selection of our initial business combination and subsequent guidance of the company.
 
Experience identifying strong management teams: The members of our founding team have invested in many successful founder-led businesses and have successfully backed teams entering new industries based on their assessed capability and business acumen. We believe we have an acute understanding of the characteristics of talented business leaders and are effective in identifying and engaging with these management teams.
 
History of operating experience: The members of our founding team are seasoned operators having all held executive level roles in various companies. We have experience in developing and executing strategy, building and retaining teams, and executing business combinations among other activities.
 
Deep network and connections to company founders: Our founding team has numerous existing connections to company founders and business leaders across sectors within the technology industry. We have invested in many companies, served on many boards and have worked alongside many of the influential professionals within the technology industry. We believe our network and our connections will assist in the successful selection of our initial business combination and subsequent guidance of the company.
 
Experience as a public company: Our founding team has co-founded two public companies and served on multiple public company boards. We have experience operating businesses at scale and within the frameworks and regulation of public markets.

We communicate with our founding team’s network, which includes private equity firms, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and business leaders, to articulate the parameters for our search for a partner company and a potential business combination and to begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities.
 
Business Combination Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective partner businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a partner business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

• | Focus: We intend to seek companies in the technology industry. We have an accomplished track record of founding, operating, and investing in this industry and expect to focus on businesses that engage with technology to serve customers in a novel and transformational manner. We believe our founding team’s expertise and understanding of innovative businesses will be paramount in identifying and assessing initial business combination candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stage: We intend to seek companies that have potential to, are poised to, or are currently undergoing rapid adoption, implementation, or distribution of their offering. We believe that our founding team’s collective experiences engaging with innovative businesses positions us well to identify, nurture, and expand high potential businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management Team: We intend to seek companies with experienced, dynamic management teams, many of whom will be founders of the businesses themselves. We intend to devote significant resources to analyzing and reaching alignment with a partner company’s management and its stakeholders and expect to work closely and collaboratively with the management team to arrive at a mutually satisfactory outcome.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Opportunity to add value: We intend to seek businesses in which we believe we can add operational value through mentorship of management, knowledge of operating challenges, experience with industry dynamics, expertise in navigating public markets, and strategic relationships with investors, among others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth: We intend to invest in businesses that are on, or have the potential to be on, what we believe to be a promising growth path. We believe that these businesses, in particular ,will benefit from access to incremental capital and over the long term, will benefit from consistent access to public markets. We will seek businesses that have a sustainable competitive advantage and that will support and sustain our expectations of their the growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benefit from being public: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth. The benefits to partner companies of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions and expanded branding in the marketplace.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reputation and market acceptance: We intend to seek companies with a sizable market share in their segment and the opportunity to achieve market leadership. They should also have defensible proprietary technology and intellectual property rights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Appropriate valuations: We are rigorous, disciplined, and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value, upside and potential downside risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any valuation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a partner business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the partner business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. In evaluating a prospective partner business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.

Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the partner business or businesses or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.
 
While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a partner business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the partner company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the partner business meets the 80% of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a partner business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the partner business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the partner business in order to meet certain objectives of the partner management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the partner or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the partner sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the partner, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the partner and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a partner. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the partner. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to the completion of our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a partner business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one partner business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the partner businesses and we will treat the partner businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.

We are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. If we sell shares to our sponsor (or any other investor) in connection with our initial business combination, the equity interest of investors in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, if the per share trading price of our ordinary shares is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement, the private placement will result in value dilution to you.
 
Other Considerations
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Officers and members of our board of directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular partner business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers or directors were to be included by a partner business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
In addition, certain of our founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, any future special purpose acquisition companies we expect they may be involved in and investment funds, accounts, co- investment vehicles and other entities such entities have invested. As a result, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any future special purpose acquisition companies we expect they may be involved in and any other investment vehicles), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these funds or investment entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same.
 
However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
In addition, our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. In particular, in the future we expect certain of our officers and directors may be officers and/or directors of other future special purpose acquisition companies.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to partner businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a partner business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the partner business may, for example, exchange their capital stock, shares or other equity interests in the partner business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe partner businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the partner business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the partner business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our founding team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential partner businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three- year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination immediately after our initial public offering in the amount of approximately $215,000,000, exclusive of funds held outside the trust account to meet our expected working capital requirements and after payment of the expenses of our initial public offering and before the payment of $7,525,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a partner business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the partner business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a partner business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger partner businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a partner business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain partner businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our founding team in their capacity as such.
