Recent Developments
 
Proposed Merger with Pineapple Energy
 
On March 1, 2021, Communications Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Helios Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSI (the “Merger Sub”), Pineapple Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Pineapple”), Lake Street Solar LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Members’ Representative”), and Randall D. Sampson, as the Shareholders’ Representative (the “Shareholders’ Representative,” and together with CSI, the Merger Sub, Pineapple and the Members’ Representative, the “Parties”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Pineapple with Pineapple surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CSI (the “Merger”).
 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, CSI has agreed to issue to the members of Pineapple 15.6 million shares of CSI’s common stock (the “Common Stock”), subject to certain adjustments, as consideration for the Merger (the “Base Consideration”). The Base Consideration will be increased for any outstanding convertible notes issued by Pineapple in a pre-closing financing, which will convert into additional shares of CSI common stock at a rate of $2.00 per share. The Base Consideration will be decreased for any outstanding indebtedness of Pineapple at the closing of the Merger in excess of $22.5 million (the “Permitted Indebtedness”), which will reduce the base consideration at a rate of $2.00 per share.
 
In addition to the Base Consideration, certain members of Pineapple may receive additional shares pursuant to an earnout. Additional shares of common stock will be issued to such members of Pineapple upon the occurrence of the following milestones:
 

● | If Pineapple discharges its Permitted Indebtedness of $22.5 million within three months of closing, then such members will be entitled to an additional 3.0 million shares of Common Stock.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If, within two years of closing, the Common Stock achieves a 30-day VWAP (volume weighted average price) of at least $6.00 per share, such members will be entitled to receive up to 4.0 million shares of Common Stock (to be increased to 5.0 million if CSI consummates the “Dispositions,” (as defined below) of a majority of its assets by the 18-month anniversary of the closing).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If, within two years of closing, the Common Stock achieves a 30-day VWAP of at least $8.00 per share, such members will be entitled to receive up to an additional 4.0 million shares of Common Stock (to be increased to 5.0 million if CSI consummates the “Dispositions” by the 18-month anniversary of the closing).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As provided in the Merger Agreement, CSI expects to declare a cash dividend that will be payable with respect to its outstanding shares as of a record date prior to the closing of the Merger (the “Pre-Closing Record Date”) to the holders of its outstanding stock on such date (the “Legacy Shareholders”). In addition, as provided in the Merger Agreement, CSI is in the process of pursuing dispositions (the “Dispositions”) of substantially all of its existing assets and businesses (“Legacy Assets”). To the extent these Dispositions occur prior to the closing of the Merger, CSI expects to declare a cash dividend that distributes a substantial portion of the proceeds from these Dispositions to the Legacy Shareholders. Following the closing, CSI will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Dispositions of the Company’s Legacy Assets as soon as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within 18 months of the closing). Proceeds that become available from the Dispositions that occur following the closing of the Merger will be distributed pro rata to the Legacy Shareholders pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement described below. CSI will continue to support these existing business lines as it pursues new owners for these businesses.
 
Prior to closing, CSI and Pineapple will cooperate in connection with a potential private equity transaction that would result in the issuance of additional shares of CSI Common Stock at or following closing of the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement also contains indemnification provisions.
 
The obligations of each of Pineapple and CSI are subject to specified conditions, including, among other matters: (i) the approval by Pineapple members and CSI shareholders of the Merger; (ii) a registration statement becoming effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, related to the Merger; and (iii) the filing of an amendment to CSI’s Articles of Incorporation in order to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance to a number at least necessary to consummate the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from Pineapple and CSI. It also contains customary covenants, including (i) providing for each of the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, and (ii) for Pineapple and CSI to carry on their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. Both CSI and Pineapple also agreed not to solicit, seek or initiate or knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage another transaction, subject to certain exceptions. CSI is required to seek shareholder approval of the issuance of the shares of Common Stock to be issued in the Merger pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules.
 
The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of Pineapple and CSI, including, without limitation, in the event that (i) any governmental entity issues a non-appealable final order permanently enjoining the Merger; (ii) the Merger is not consummated by August 31, 2021; or (iii) the other party breaches its representations, warranties or covenants under the Merger Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a closing condition and such breach is not cured within 10-days of receipt of written notice of such breach.
 
The Merger Agreement provides that both CSI and Pineapple will be obligated to pay the other a termination fee of $2.5 million plus reimbursement of certain expenses, up to $750,000, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.
 
The foregoing description of terms in the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 1, 2020.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and other terms, provisions and conditions that the parties made to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied therein were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating their respective terms. Moreover, they may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to shareholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. For the foregoing reasons, no person should rely on such representations, warranties, covenants or other terms, provisions or conditions as statements of factual information at the time they were made or otherwise. Unless required by applicable law, CSI undertakes no obligation to update such information.

Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Pineapple entered into a Voting Agreement, dated March 1, 2021 (the “Voting Agreement”) with officers and director of CSI (the “CSI Holders”). The CSI Holders hold in the aggregate approximately 13.8% of CSI’s outstanding shares. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, each CSI Holder has agreed, with respect to all of the voting securities of CSI that such CSI Holder beneficially owns as of the date thereof or thereafter, to vote in favor of the Merger. The Voting Agreement will terminate on the Effective Time (as defined therein) or upon termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
 
The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the March 1, 2020 Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, CSI will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”) with a person designated by CSI as the Holders’ Representative (as defined therein), and the Rights Agent (as defined therein). Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, each shareholder of CSI as of immediately prior to the closing of the Merger will receive one non-transferable Contingent Value Right (“CVR”) for each outstanding share of common stock of CSI held as of the close of business on the day immediately before the Effective Time of the Merger, which will represent the right to receive pro-rata distributions of proceeds from Dispositions that occur following the Effective Time.
 
Sale of Suttle Business
 
Suttle, Inc. was a significant component of CSI’s business since 1969. As a key element of the Company’s strategic plan, however, the Company sold substantially all of Suttle’s business, assets and operations pursuant to two separate transactions occurring in 2019 and 2020 that were previously reported. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Discontinued Operations.”
 
As a result of the Suttle sale, unless otherwise noted, all information in this Form 10-K about Suttle will be discussed and presented as discontinued operations and the Company will report its remaining business operations as continuing operations as described below.
 
After giving effect to the Suttle transactions and following the acquisition of Ecessa during the second quarter of 2020 and the merging of certain operations, CSI is principally engaged (i) through its Electronics & Software (“E&S”) segment in the manufacture and sale of Ethernet switches, core media conversion products, and other connectivity and data transmission products, and (ii) through its Services & Support (“S&S”) segment, in providing technology solutions including virtualization, managed services, wired and wireless network design and implementation, and hybrid cloud infrastructure and deployment.
 
Acquisition of Ecessa Corporation
 
On May 14, 2020, CSI acquired Ecessa Corporation in a reverse triangular merger for $4.6 million in cash. Ecessa designs and distributes software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) solutions for businesses through the deployment of field installations of Ecessa Edge®, PowerLink®, and WANworX® controllers and is part of the Company’s Services & Support segment. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Combinations.”
 
Acquisition of IVDesk
 
On November 3, 2020, the Company acquired the operating assets of privately held IVDesk Minnesota, Inc. (“IVDesk”) from a third-party receiver (“Receiver”) appointed by Hennepin County, Minnesota State District Court Judge for aggregate consideration of $1.4 million, including a $550,000 earnout payment made in March 2021. IVDesk provides private cloud services to small- and mid-size businesses (SMB), with a particular focus on the financial services industry. IVDesk currently services over 85 customers across the U.S. with a focus on a tri-state region with Minnesota at the center. IVDesk’s business model is built on monthly recurring revenue and is included within the Company’s Services & Support Segment. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Combinations.”

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As noted within this Form 10-K, we have classified the operations of Suttle as discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019. Non-allocated general and administrative expenses are separately accounted for as “Other” in the Company’s segment reporting. Additionally, any indirect general and administrative costs previously allocated to Suttle are also included in “Other.” Intersegment revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. Further information regarding these segments, including customer and industry concentration, is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.
 
Information Regarding Business Segments
 
(i) Electronics & Software 
 
This segment is comprised of CSI’s Transition Networks, Inc. (“Transition Networks” or “Transition”) and Net2Edge Limited (“Net2Edge”) businesses.

Manufacturing and Sources of Supply
 
Electronics & Software uses contract manufacturers to manufacture its products in different geographical locations, in addition to OEM partners through which the Company sources product and markets under its own name. In 2020, 91% of the total value of Electronics & Software’s products were manufactured in or sourced from Trade Agreement Acts (TAA) compliant countries (i.e. Taiwan, U.S., U.K.) and the remaining 9% was manufactured in or sourced from other geographies. Offshore sources of supply are subject to certain risks, including political risk.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
Electronics & Software’s products are used in a broad array of markets including federal government, enterprise, service provider, industrial, security, and surveillance markets. Electronics & Software has a broad customer base that uses its products in a variety of applications.
 
The line of Ethernet switches (both PoE and non-PoE) is used in last-mile access, backhaul, wiring closets and at end-user stations. These are sold into security networks, intelligent transportation applications, smart buildings, corporate enterprise networks, and other IoT applications domestically and abroad. The media conversion product line is used in several applications. The ION chassis-based modular systems are used primarily in telecommunications closets for high-density applications or when multiple protocols need to be supported. Stand-alone media converters are used typically at customer premises or for lower density applications. The Carrier Ethernet NID line of products addresses the high-quality access requirements for both business services and wireless backhaul data communications and telecommunications applications.
 
Marketing primarily consists of direct marketing using a sales force, tradeshows, trade magazine advertising, on-line advertising, website, email, social media, and public relations activities. Electronics & Software also provides and participates in advertising and cooperative marketing campaigns with distribution partners.
 
Research and Development
 
Electronics & Software develops products for the federal government, enterprise, service provider, security, and industrial markets. This includes developing commercial and hardened PoE switches, converters for emerging protocols and existing protocols in new markets, as well as new industry standards. Some of these products include devices built on the IEEE 802.3ah, 802.3ag, ITU-T Y.1731 standards, Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)® standards, and PoE devices based on the IEEE 802.3af, 802.3at, 802.3bt standards. Some design efforts are paced by the development of critical components such as integrated circuits and optical transceivers.
 
Research and development consists primarily of designing, prototyping, and testing of equipment and supplies associated with developing new products and enhancing existing products. Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and were $2,808,000 in 2020 compared to $3,600,000 in 2019.
 
Electronics & Software conducts its research and development operations in the United States, at its Minnetonka, Minnesota headquarters location and out of its Net2Edge Basingstoke location. While these locations have primary engineering and product development responsibility, E&S occasionally uses third-party design services and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODM”) to support specific product design requirements.
 
Competition
 
E&S faces strong competition across its entire product line. A large number of competitors exist for high-volume products in Ethernet switches and media converters. Low-cost competitors from China and Taiwan are strongest in (i) Asian, (ii) European, Middle Eastern, and African (“EMEA”) and (iii) South American markets. E&S also faces new competitors as it enters new markets for smart cities, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, and higher performance devices for the service provider market.

Services & Support’s virtualization engineers assess, design, deploy, and manage virtualization programs that are designed to ensure user access to any workload, anytime, anywhere, on any device. Services & Support’s virtualization services encompass network infrastructure, security, desktops, servers, applications, storage, and any combination thereof, including connectivity and software licensing. As Services & Support clients continue to adopt virtualization, they experience the economies of scale, reduced capital requirements, enhanced security, and disaster recovery protections that are inherent in virtualized environments.
Competition
 
The Company expects the Managed Services market will continue to grow significantly over the next several years, and as a result will attract many competitors, becoming a highly competitive industry. In response to these factors, Services & Support’s focus is to quickly adapt to the changing needs of its clients through the adoption and productizing of new IT Service technologies as they become available. An example of this would be the addition of several security services to the Services & Support portfolio in 2019 including security tools to monitor the flow of sensitive data in and on the network, additional cloud-based services through Azure and AWS and enhanced end-point security services. By ensuring Services & Support continuously evaluates the services we offer with a focus on the changing market, we are able to provide a better range of services to our clients and prospects while increasing their reliance upon us as their IT service provider.
Order Book 
 
Outstanding customer orders and contracts for Services & Support products and services were approximately $4,333,000 at March 1, 2021 and $1,546,000 at March 1, 2020. The Company does not consider current outstanding orders and contracts as a significant indicator of longer-term future results.
Human Capital
 
As of March 15, 2021, the Company employed 150 people. Of this number, 92 were within the Electronics & Software segment (including 74 in the U.S and 18 in the U.K.), 37 within the Services & Support segment, and 21 in corporate general and administrative positions. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union.
 
The Company views its employees and culture as keys to its success.  The Company aims to attract and retain qualified personnel and provides wages and benefits that are competitive locally to reward employees for performance.  The Company values innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety and engagement as they attract, develop, and retain the best talent. We have adopted a diversity statement that is posted on our website at https://www.commsystems.com/corporate-governance/communications-systems-inc-diversity-inclusion-statement/.
 
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority of our leaders.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted temporary office closures, implemented shelter-in-place orders and restrictions and instituted a mandatory work from home policy for substantially all office employees, and instituted social distancing work rules for operations personnel that continued to work in our facilities to satisfy customer orders.  We believe the Company has generally been successful implementing proactive measures to protect the health and safety of its employees while maintaining business continuity and high levels of service to our customers.
