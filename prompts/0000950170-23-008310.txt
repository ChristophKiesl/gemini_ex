Overview
We are a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing next-generation radiopharmaceuticals as precision medicines. We have developed our Targeted Alpha Therapies, or TAT, platform to enable us to connect alpha particle emitting isotopes to various targeting molecules to selectively deliver the alpha particle payloads to tumors. Our TAT platform is underpinned by our ability to radiolabel various classes of targeting molecules (including antibodies, small molecules and peptides), our research and insights into the underlying chemistry and biology of alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals, our differentiated capabilities in target identification, candidate generation, manufacturing and supply chain, our proprietary Fast-ClearTM linker technology used in conjunction with antibody-based targeting molecules, and development of imaging agents. We believe that our TATs have the potential to build on the successes of currently available radiopharmaceuticals and be broadly applicable across multiple targets and tumor types.
Radiopharmaceuticals are drugs that contain medical isotopes, which are unstable elements that emit radiation and can be used to diagnose and treat cancers. To create targeted radiopharmaceuticals, radiation emitting medical isotopes are typically attached to targeting molecules, which are then administered via intravenous injection. Once administered, the radiopharmaceuticals selectively target tumor antigens that are unique to, or preferentially expressed on, cancer cells throughout the body. There are two main classes of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, which differ based on the types of particles that are emitted—those based on beta emitting isotopes and those based on alpha emitting isotopes. Beta emitting isotopes damage cancer cells primarily by creating free radicals that in turn damage cellular machinery and cause single-strand DNA breaks. In contrast, alpha particles cause greater physical damage to cancer cells than beta particles, including multiple double-strand DNA breaks, which are highly lethal to cancer cells. Alpha particles are larger and have higher linear energy transfer than beta particles. This allows alpha particles to deposit a greater amount of tumor-killing energy over a short distance as they travel approximately one to three cells, compared to the relatively long distance of up to 12 mm for beta particles, allowing alpha particles to cause damage to cancer cells in close proximity while reducing off-target radiation exposure.
We are leveraging our proprietary TAT platform to build on the successes of currently available radiation therapies and create the next generation of radiopharmaceuticals. Our TATs are comprised of several components: (i) a targeting molecule, such as an antibody, small molecule, peptide or other delivery vehicle, that is designed to selectively target antigens that are unique to, or preferentially expressed on, cancer cells throughout the body; (ii) the alpha emitting medical isotope actinium-225, or 225Ac, designed to kill cancer cells; and (iii) in the case of antibodies, our proprietary Fast-Clear linker that attaches the targeting molecule to the radioactive payload. Our Fast-Clear linker has shown in preclinical studies the differentiated ability to promote enhanced clearance of the non-tumor localized 225Ac payload without sacrificing the uptake of 225Ac into the tumor, which we believe will improve tolerability and widen the therapeutic window of our antibody product candidates.
We believe that our TAT platform, strategy and product candidates, if approved, could provide several potential advantages over currently available approaches, including:
•enhanced tumor-killing power by using alpha particle radiation; 
 •ability to pursue various differentiated cancer targets employing a range of different classes of targeting molecules; 
 •broad applicability across multiple tumor types; 
 •focus on areas of high unmet medical need; 
 •increased tolerability and therapeutic window associated with our Fast-Clear linker; 
 •exploitation of multiple mechanisms of action, including direct DNA damage and an alpha particle-mediated enhanced anti-tumor immune response; and
 •established manufacturing and supply chain expertise and infrastructure.
 Our most advanced product candidate, FPI-2265, is a Phase 2 program acquired from RadioMedix, Inc., or RadioMedix, in February 2023 that targets prostate-specific membrane antigens, or PSMA, using 225Ac. PSMA is a protein that is commonly found on the surface of normal prostate cells but is found in higher amounts on prostate cancer cells, as well as in lower amounts in other tissues, such as the small intestine and salivary glands. PSMA drives cancer invasion and metastases and is expressed in over 80% of men with prostate cancer, with higher PSMA expression being correlated to worse outcomes.

Pluvicto, a lutetium-177, or 177Lu, PSMA-targeted therapy, is currently a U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved radiopharmaceutical-based therapy to treat patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. There are no alpha emitting PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRPC. We believe that the challenges associated with producing and securing a supply of 225Ac have proven to be a barrier for the clinical advancement of PSMA-targeted alpha emitting therapies and, as a result, the majority of programs evaluating PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals currently in development utilize a beta particle emitter.
Recent data from over 250 patients treated in investigator sponsored trials with 225Ac-PSMA agents, including both patients previously treated with 177Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceuticals (approximately 100 patients) and 177Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceutical therapy naïve patients, have shown compelling clinical data and biochemical response rates (including PSA50, the percentage of participants who had a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, decline of at least 50 percent from baseline) and a tolerability profile that we feel supports further development of an 225Ac-based PSMA-targeted therapy. We believe our access to 225Ac and expertise developing alpha therapies provides an opportunity for us to begin treating patients refractory to lutetium-based PSMA therapies as well as an opportunity to move to earlier lines of therapy both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents. Upon transfer of the investigational new drug application, or IND, from RadioMedix to us, we intend to expand the Phase 2 clinical trial across multiple sites. We expect to report preliminary data for the first 20-30 patients in this study, including safety and efficacy data, in the first quarter of 2024.
 Our second most advanced product candidate, FPI-1434, utilizes our Fast-Clear linker to connect a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, or IGF-1R, with 225Ac. We are currently evaluating FPI-1434 as a monotherapy in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with IGF-1R positive solid tumors to assess its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics as well as to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose. As part of the screening process, patients are administered the imaging analogue of FPI-1434, which utilizes the same linker and targeting molecule, but replaces 225Ac with the radioactive isotope indium-111, or 111In, and only those patients who meet predefined tumor uptake and dosimetry, and show organ radiation exposure within the limits of established standards for normal organ radiation tolerability, are advanced into the trial. In our ongoing Phase 1 trial, we are exploring various dosing levels of FPI-1434 in two dosing regimens: one with FPI-1434 alone, and another in which a small dose of cold antibody (naked IGF-1R antibody without the isotope) is administered prior to the imaging analogue and prior to each dose of FPI-1434. We are exploring the impact of administering the cold IGF-1R antibody prior to the imaging analogue and prior to each dose of FPI-1434 on the biodistribution, safety and tumor uptake. We refer to this dosing regimen as the “cold/hot” dosing regimen; we refer to the dosing regimen of FPI-1434 without pre-administration of the cold antibody as the “hot only” dosing regimen. The introduction of this “cold/hot” dosing regimen resulted, in part, from a cold antibody sub-study, or CASS, that was performed as part of the Phase 1 study, whereby a small amount of cold IGF-1R antibody was administered prior to administration of the imaging analogue only. In the CASS we treated five (5) patients at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and/or 1.5 mg/kg of cold IGF-1R antibody and saw, in general, an improved lesion uptake in most patients who received the cold IGF-1R antibody pre-administration and the lesion uptake was independent of anatomic location (including bone, mediastinum, lung, liver, and lymph nodes). Results at 0.5 mg/kg were generally more favorable than the 1.5 mg/kg dose of cold antibody. Imaging with the pre-administration of the cold antibody was well tolerated. As a result of the CASS data, we are prioritizing the cold/hot dosing regimen over the hot only dosing regimen. We are currently prioritizing patient enrollment into the “cold/hot” dosing regimen. We anticipate reporting Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetics, and imaging data, including any evidence of anti-tumor activity, and details on the dosing regimen in the second quarter of 2023.
 In preclinical studies, FPI-1434 has been evaluated in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors and DNA damage response inhibitors, or DDRis, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors. Based on preclinical data, we believe that the synergies observed with either class of agent could expand the addressable patient populations for FPI-1434 and allow for potential use in earlier lines of treatment. We anticipate initiation of a Phase 1 combination study with FPI-1434 and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) to occur six to nine months following determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose of FPI-1434 monotherapy in connection with a collaboration agreement executed in May 2021 with Merck.
 We submitted INDs to the FDA for FPI-1966 and FPI-1967, the imaging analogue, for the treatment of cancers including head and neck and bladder cancers expressing fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, or FGFR3, in the second quarter of 2021 and announced FDA clearance of the INDs in July 2021. The Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial of FPI-1966 in patients with solid tumors expressing FGFR3, intended to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose, has been initiated with study sites open to patient recruitment. We dosed the first patient in August 2022 and plan to provide a clinical update in 2024.
In November 2020, we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited, or AstraZeneca, to jointly discover, develop and commercialize next-generation alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals and combination therapies
2


for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and AstraZeneca will jointly discover, develop and commercialize up to three novel TATs, which will utilize Fusion’s Fast-Clear linker technology platform with antibodies in AstraZeneca’s oncology portfolio. In January 2022, we announced the nomination of the first TAT candidate under the strategic collaboration agreement, a bispecific antibody owned by AstraZeneca radiolabeled with 225Ac utilizing our Fast-Clear linker technology, which we refer to as FPI-2068. In addition, we and AstraZeneca will exclusively explore up to five combination strategies involving our existing assets, including our FPI-1434 and FPI-1966 product candidates, and AstraZeneca therapeutics, for the treatment of various cancers. Each party will retain full rights to their respective assets.
 In April 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen, to acquire Ipsen’s intellectual property and assets related to IPN-1087. IPN-1087 is a small molecule targeting neurotensin receptor 1, or NTSR1, a protein expressed on multiple solid tumor types. Using our TAT platform, we combined IPN-1087 with 225Ac to create an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical, FPI-2059, targeting solid tumors expressing NTSR1, including neuroendocrine differentiated prostate cancer, and colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. The FDA cleared our IND for FPI-2059 and the corresponding imaging analogue, FPI-2058, in June 2022. Study initiation activities are ongoing in a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial of FPI-2059 in patients with solid tumors expressing NTSR1, intended to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. We plan to provide guidance on timelines for the FPI-2059 program following site activations and initial experience with patient screening and patient enrollment.
 Our company was founded to advance certain intellectual property relating to radiopharmaceuticals that had been developed by the Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization, or CPDC, which we believe is a center of excellence and recognized leader in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, John Valliant, Ph.D., who has over 25 years of experience working in the radiopharmaceutical field, was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the CPDC. To support our growing portfolio of radiopharmaceuticals in development, we have built robust manufacturing and supply chain capabilities for TATs, including the execution of multiple strategic 225Ac supply agreements. We have developed a supply chain to receive 225Ac from producers, such as the Department of Energy, or DoE, and other third-party suppliers, to assemble and manufacture the finished radiopharmaceutical candidates by connecting the 225Ac to the targeting molecule and to supply the finished product candidates to global clinical sites, including those in Canada, the United States and Australia.
 Our Pipeline
 We are leveraging our TAT platform to advance a pipeline of alpha-based therapeutic programs to treat various cancers. The figure below details our current pipeline of TATs.
 
Background on Radiation-Based Therapies and Radiopharmaceuticals
External beam radiation therapy, or EBRT, is one of the most widely used treatments for cancer, with approximately 50% of all cancer patients receiving radiation therapy during the course of treatment. To deliver EBRT, a radiation therapy device is used to aim a beam of ionizing radiation into the tumor to kill cancer cells. Based on advances in radiation technology, EBRT is highly effective in killing cancer cells and this treatment modality contributes towards approximately 40% of curative treatment for cancer. However, despite the successes of EBRT treatment, only a limited number of sites in the body can be irradiated at any one time by this treatment due to the off-target effects of radiation that can damage normal tissues. In addition, not all types of cancers can be treated with EBRT, as certain organs or tumor types may be difficult to access with radiation

beams. As a result, EBRT use has generally been restricted to treating localized tumors and is not typically used as a monotherapy to treat patients who have metastatic disease.
Evolution of Radiopharmaceuticals
Radiopharmaceuticals have been developed as a way to precisely apply the tumor-killing power of radiation to a wider array of cancers, including for patients who have metastatic disease. Radiopharmaceuticals are drugs that contain medical isotopes, which are unstable elements that emit radiation and can be used to diagnose and treat cancers. To create radiopharmaceuticals, radiation emitting medical isotopes are typically attached to targeting molecules and administered via intravenous injection. Once administered, the radiopharmaceuticals selectively target tumor antigens that are unique to, or preferentially expressed on, cancer cells throughout the body. Currently available targeted radiopharmaceuticals have demonstrated the ability to simultaneously bind to and kill multiple tumors.
Alpha vs. Beta Radiopharmaceuticals
There are two main classes of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, which differ based on the types of particles that are emitted—those based on beta emitting isotopes and those based on alpha emitting isotopes. Historically, due to the readily available supply of beta emitting isotopes and the better understanding of their chemistry and biology, they were more widely used than alpha emitting isotopes. As a result, first-generation targeted therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals were based on beta emitting isotopes, which kill cancer cells primarily by creating free radicals that damage cellular machinery and cause single-strand DNA breaks, which can be repaired by the cell. As a result, certain cancers are refractory to beta particle-based radiopharmaceutical treatment, including those with low oxygen levels (hypoxic tumors). Products based on beta emitting isotopes have been developed successfully, but as the development of radiopharmaceuticals continued to evolve, a deeper understanding of the potential of alpha emitting isotopes for treating cancer has emerged.
Compared to beta particles, alpha particles cause greater physical damage to cancer cells, including multiple double-strand DNA breaks, for which there is no viable resistance mechanism, unlike in the case of single-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks are highly lethal, with even a single double-strand break being sufficient to cause cancer cell death. Alpha particles are 8,000 times larger than beta particles with an approximately 4,000-fold higher energy transfer rate, providing alpha particles with the advantage of depositing a high amount of tumor-killing energy over a short distance of one to three cells, compared to the relatively long distance of up to 12 mm for beta particles. This feature enables alpha particles to cause damage only to cancer cells in close proximity, reducing the risk of off-target radiation and normal cell damage that can occur with beta particles. However, because of the short travel distance, alpha particles need to be delivered into or on the surface of tumor cells to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

The graphic below illustrates a comparison of some of the key differences between beta particles and alpha particles.


* Molecule size and arrows representing travel distance shown for illustrative purposes only and not drawn to scale.
Examples of Commercially Available Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals
Two of the earliest antibody targeted radiopharmaceuticals, Bexxar and Zevalin, are beta emitting therapies for the treatment of CD20 positive lymphomas. Despite receiving approval from the FDA in 2003 and 2002, respectively, Bexxar and Zevalin proved difficult to handle commercially and required specialized rooms for administration, which limited the number of sites that could deliver the treatment and market acceptance of the therapies. Usage of Bexxar and Zevalin was also hampered by supply chain issues, including the need for some on-site production and handling, and reimbursement challenges due to the logistics of medical oncologists having to manage the patients while nuclear medicine physicians administered the therapies. These challenges limited the commercial success of these first-generation radiopharmaceuticals.
The first and only approved alpha-emitting therapy is Xofigo, a salt of radium that naturally localizes to regions where cancer cells are infiltrating bone. Xofigo was approved in 2013 for the treatment of bone metastases associated with prostate cancer. Unlike some of the first-generation targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies, Xofigo utilizes centralized manufacturing, can be administered in typical oncology suites and has overcome reimbursement challenges.
Next-generation targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies have been developed and approved, namely Lutathera and Pluvicto, both beta-emitters. Since its approval in 2018, annual worldwide sales of Lutathera reached $471 million in 2022, despite only being approved for a short period of time and for only a subset of neuroendocrine cancers expressing somatostatin receptor, or SSTR. Pluvicto, which is targeted to PSMA expressing tumors, received approval in March 2022 for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. Sales of Pluvicto already reached $271 million by the end of 2022. A recent study showed the potential for Pluvicto to move into earlier lines of therapy, specifically prior to chemotherapy.
Our Targeted Alpha Therapies Platform
Overview
We are developing the next generation of precision oncology TATs that have the potential to treat a large population of cancer patients across multiple tumor types, including those with metastatic disease. By leveraging our proprietary TAT platform, we aim to develop alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals using various targeting molecules to deliver the radioactive payload directly to difficult to treat tumors. Our TAT platform is underpinned by our ability to radiolabel various classes of targeting molecules (including antibodies, small molecules and peptides), our research and insights into the underlying chemistry and biology of alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals, our differentiated capabilities in target identification, candidate generation, manufacturing and supply chain, our proprietary Fast-Clear linker technology used in conjunction with antibody-based targeting molecules, and the development of imaging agents.
Our TAT platform gives us the ability to develop alpha therapies against a range of targets and cancer types employing a variety of different delivery vehicles, including antibodies, small molecules, and peptides. Our growing pipeline, which is derived from our platform, is supported by our infrastructure, preferred partnerships and expertise in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing. We utilized our TAT platform to discover, design and develop multiple programs, including FPI-1434, FPI-1966 and FPI-2059, which are each currently in ongoing and planned Phase 1 clinical trials. We plan to continue to leverage our platform to assess the potential of, and develop multiple additional pipeline programs, including FPI-2265, an 225Ac targeted PSMA agent currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial, and FPI-2068.
Our Choice of Alpha Emitter—Actinium-225
Although there are many alpha emitting isotopes, we believe that the ideal therapeutic isotope should emit multiple alpha particles in rapid succession to maximize damage to cancer cells and increase efficacy, while having a half-life long enough to allow for central manufacturing and distribution of products to clinical sites in a ready-to-use form. We are developing our TATs with 225Ac due to its decay chain and half-life. In particular, the 225Ac decay chain releases four alpha emissions in relatively rapid succession, maximizing the damage to the tumor DNA before ultimately becoming a non-radioactive isotope. 225Ac has a half-life of 10 days, which we believe is the ideal window to allow for centralized manufacturing and distribution. Although some other alpha emitting isotopes, such as thorium-227, also have longer half-lives, 225Ac benefits from a more rapid decay profile that maximizes the energy density inside the cancer cell; a physical property we believe enhances tumor-killing power. Other alpha emitting isotopes, such as lead-212, have shorter half-lives and decay within several hours, which causes centralized manufacturing and commercial distribution challenges.
Alpha particles kill tumors through multiple mechanisms. The primary mechanism of action is direct cell damage through the induction of multiple double-strand DNA breaks. As alpha particles traverse the nucleus of a cell, they create a linear track of direct chromosomal damage, leaving behind multiple clusters of double-strand DNA breaks. These direct alpha particle hits induce cell kill up to a distance of 100 µm, which is equal to a depth of a few cells. A secondary mechanism, which would expand effective direct cell kill range of the alpha particle, is referred to as the Bystander Effect. This effect has been shown to be as significant to the overall efficacy in killing cancer cells as the direct DNA breaks. The Bystander Effect has been shown to propagate alpha particle-induced cell death from irradiated dying cells to kill adjacent non-irradiated cells up to 1,000 µm away in a three-dimensional solid tumor model. In addition to these two mechanisms of action, in preclinical studies, we also observed that the tumor cell death mediated by 225Ac caused the release of tumor antigens which were picked up by antigen-presenting cells and led to the induction of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We believe these CD8+ T cells can attack other tumors expressing the same antigen, even if those tumors do not express the receptor target of the targeting antibody of the TAT. In our preclinical studies, we observed that this third mechanism created a vaccine effect that prevented the regrowth of tumors upon re-challenge.
Our Chemistry and Biology Expertise with Actinium-225
We believe that our experience working with alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals may position us to build on the success of currently approved radiopharmaceuticals by utilizing 225Ac to develop next-generation radiopharmaceutical therapies. 225Ac has complex chemistry and requires extensive experience and expertise to develop and properly characterize 225Ac radiopharmaceuticals with the required tumor targeting, shelf-life, in vivo stability and potential for commercial-scale manufacturing. For example, the high energy emitted from 225Ac can cause product candidates to prematurely degrade. We believe we have the experience and know-how to develop molecules and formulations of 225Ac to maximize the shelf-life of our product candidates and allow for centralized production and distribution. In addition to a deep understanding of the chemistry of 225Ac, we have differentiated knowledge of the underlying biology of 225Ac and its mechanisms of directly
6


damaging the DNA of tumors through single and double-strand DNA breaks, causing the Bystander Effect and using the immune system’s adaptive response function to attack non-target expressing tumors in order to stimulate a vaccine effect.
Our Selection of Targets and Targeting Molecules
Our platform and strategy create an extensive pool of potential targets and targeting molecule candidates from which to develop novel TATs, including: (i) molecules with good tumor cell targeting but poor efficacy, (ii) molecules with good efficacy but poor safety profiles, (iii) novel target molecule discoveries, and (iv) life-cycle management opportunities for commercially available molecules. Potential candidates can come from discontinued programs, novel molecules in development, approved molecules or other proprietary agents in connection with in-licensing activities, partnerships, research collaborations and internal research efforts.
 We have developed a proprietary algorithm to identify targeting molecules and their targets that we believe would make ideal TATs. The factors that we consider in choosing targeting molecules include (i) preferential and/or elevated expression of their target receptors on tumors versus normal tissues, (ii) the availability of known molecules that bind to these targets with high affinity, (iii) accessibility of these receptors following systemic administration of the targeting molecule, (iv) rapid internalization of these receptors to concentrate the bound alpha particles inside tumor cells, (v) long tumor retention time (e.g. many days), and (vi) clinical need and size of the addressable market. To date, we have identified more than 20 priority tumor antigens that we believe represent viable opportunities to develop into novel TATs when used in conjunction with our platform as a way to expand our pipeline of next-generation precision alpha emitting radiopharmaceuticals.
Our initial approach led to the in-license of antibodies that have been in clinical development and have demonstrated the ability to localize in tumor cells with favorable tolerability data. We believe that the addition of an alpha emitting isotope to these types of antibodies, using our Fast-Clear linker technology, renders the antibodies more potent and tolerable than when they were used as protein-only therapies or as antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs. With multiple INDs or IND-enabling studies we have leveraged our internal discovery capabilities and expertise to expand our research and development efforts by including all classes of targeting molecules, including antibodies, small molecules and peptides.
 Fast-Clear Linker Technology
An important element of our TAT platform is our Fast-Clear linker technology which is designed to enable us to connect our alpha emitting isotope of choice, 225Ac, to antibody-based targeting molecules that are designed to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells. When compared to commercially available linkers, our proprietary Fast-Clear linker has shown in preclinical studies the differentiated ability to promote enhanced clearance of the non-tumor localized 225Ac payload without sacrificing the uptake of the TAT in the tumor. Rapid clearance of the alpha emitting isotope from normal tissues is important and creates the opportunity to enhance tolerability and widen the therapeutic window of our product candidates.
As depicted in the figure below, we can generate TATs that are comprised of three components: (i) an antibody that is designed to selectively target antigens that are unique to, or preferentially expressed on, cancer cells throughout the body, (ii) the alpha emitting medical isotope 225Ac designed to kill cancer cells, and (iii) our proprietary Fast-Clear linker that attaches the targeting molecule to the radioactive payload.

When our TATs are metabolized outside of cancer cells, the Fast-Clear linker, unlike standard commercial linkers, is designed to rapidly clear from the body along with any isotopes remaining bound to that linker. We believe that our linker’s
7


ability to promote clearance without compromising the tumor’s uptake of the alpha particle overcomes a longstanding challenge of radiopharmaceutical drug development.
As an example, in our preclinical studies, we administered mice (n=5 in each dose group or vehicle group) with either an analogue of FPI-1434 or a radioimmunoconjugate utilizing a commercially available linker. Over a seven-day observation period following administration, we measured the amount of radioactivity excreted in the mice urine and feces to determine the amount of non-tumor localized radiopharmaceuticals cleared. As shown in the image below, our Fast-Clear linker has been observed in preclinical studies to clear 3.1 times the amount of non-tumor localized radiopharmaceuticals compared to the most widely used commercial linker, thereby reducing radiation exposure to normal tissue. We believe the ability of our Fast-Clear linker to clear more non-tumor localized radiopharmaceuticals than commercial linkers could widen the therapeutic window of our product candidates.
Fast-Clear Linker Promoted Enhanced Clearance of Non-Tumor Localized Radiopharmaceuticals


While our initial product candidates employ the same linker, we have developed a proprietary library of Fast-Clear linkers with distinct properties that may be used for future radiopharmaceutical candidates.
Candidate Generation
 Our TAT platform can rapidly generate potential product candidates for testing. Our radiochemistry team uses established procedures to label the molecule with 225Ac. If the targeting molecule is an antibody, we utilize our Fast-Clear linkers to attach the antibody to 225Ac and evaluate whether the addition of the Fast-Clear linker does not affect the binding affinity and biological function of the targeting molecule. For all our development candidates, we perform biodistribution studies in human tumor xenograft models to assess uptake of the radioisotope in the tumor versus normal tissues. This is followed by preliminary preclinical efficacy studies using the 225Ac radiolabeled version of the targeting molecule to assess whether the TAT should be advanced to longer term preclinical efficacy and toxicity studies. It typically takes six to nine months from the receipt or development of a targeting molecule to the commencement of studies enabling an IND that includes the evaluation of different doses and dose schedules in a variety of tumor types, as well as dosimetry and toxicity studies.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Capabilities
We were founded to advance certain intellectual property relating to radiopharmaceuticals that had been developed by CPDC, of which we believe is a recognized leader and a national center of excellence in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. We have access to CPDC’s successor’s (known as AtomVie) infrastructure and capabilities under a preferred master services agreement. As noted above, we have developed a supply chain to receive 225Ac from producers, such as the Department of Energy, or DoE, and other third-party suppliers, assemble and manufacture the finished radiopharmaceutical candidates by connecting the 225Ac to the targeting molecule and can supply the finished product candidates to global clinical sites, including those in Canada, the United States and Australia. We also have internal manufacturing expertise, which facilitates rapid tech transfer to other third-party manufacturers, and extensive experience in managing the full supply chain for radiopharmaceuticals.

More recently, we contracted with Cardinal Health in May 2019 and SpectronRx in March 2022 as additional manufacturers of our TAT product candidates. In addition, in June 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Hamilton, Ontario-based McMaster University for approximately 27,000 square feet of space at our current headquarters for the purpose of establishing a manufacturing facility to supplement our existing agreements with third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product for preclinical and clinical needs. We expect that construction of our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for preclinical studies, clinical trials, and commercialization, enable more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term margins if any of our product candidates successfully complete clinical trials and receive marketing approval. However, we expect to continue to rely on third-party suppliers as we currently do even after the expected completion of our manufacturing facility in 2024.
Imaging Agents
 For each of our product candidates, we create an imaging analogue that replaces 225Ac with the commercially used radioactive imaging isotope 111In. This allows us to assess uptake of the imaging analogue into tumors and to determine radiation doses to key organs. The imaging analogue versions of our product candidates are leveraged in both preclinical and clinical development and are used to enrich the patient population in our clinical trials by identifying the patients and tumor types more likely to respond to therapy.
 Our Programs
Our TAT platform enables us to connect alpha particle emitting isotopes to various targeting molecules, that are designed to selectively deliver the alpha particle payloads to tumors. We are currently investigating TATs utilizing multiple classes of targeting molecules such as antibodies (including bispecific antibodies), small molecules and peptides.
 FPI-2265: 225Ac-PSMA-I&T
 FPI-2265, previously referred to as 225Ac-PSMA-I&T, is designed to target PSMA. PSMA is a protein that is commonly found on the surface of normal prostate cells but is found in higher amounts on prostate cancer cells, as well as in lower amounts in other tissues, such as the small intestine and salivary glands. PSMA drives cancer invasion and metastases and is expressed in over 80% of men with prostate cancer, with higher PSMA expression being correlated with worse outcomes. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rates are 88.2%, 74.2%, 67.7%, and 26.8% for patients exhibiting no, low, medium, or high PSMA expression, respectively. PSMA is a transmembrane protein, meaning it exists across the cell membrane, but approximately 95% rests on the surface of prostate cells, making it readily accessible to drug targeting. It is possible to identify patients who have PSMA expressing tumors through the use of positron emission tomography, or PET, imaging and a PSMA-targeted imaging agent.
Recent data from over 250 patients treated in investigator sponsored trials with 225Ac-PSMA agents, including both patients previously treated with 177Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceuticals (approximately 100 patients) and 177Lu-PSMA
9


radiopharmaceutical therapy naïve patients, have shown compelling clinical data and biochemical response rates (including PSA50) and a tolerability profile that we feel supports further development of an alpha-based 225Ac therapeutic candidate.
 
The example above shows gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET/computed tomography scans of one patient who was treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and subsequently with 225Ac-PSMA-617 (Figure: Kratochwil, C. et al. 225Ac-PSMA-617 for PSMA-Targeted α-Radiation Therapy of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. The Journal of Nuclear Medicine. Vol. 57 No. 12. December 2016). The first image shows the initial tumor spread (A), then restaging after two cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 presenting progression (B). In contrast, restaging after two cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-617 is shown in the third image (C) and the final image after an additional cycle of 225Ac-PSMA-617 (D) presented an impressive radiographic response.
 Based on the data from the aforementioned investigator-sponsored studies, RadioMedix determined it would initiate a Phase 2 trial, which was allowed to proceed by the FDA. The Phase 2 trial is an open-label clinical trial in patients with mCRPC who may have been previously treated with either a taxane therapy (docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel), a 177Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceutical or both. We acquired the rights to an IND for 225Ac-PSMA-I&T from RadioMedix in February 2023. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients, each of whom is expected to receive up to four doses of FPI-2265 every eight weeks. Patients will receive a starting dose of FPI-2265 of 100 kBq/kg which may be de-escalated, based on a dosing regimen that was evaluated by investigators who have sponsored single-institution, academic studies. Patients will undergo a PSMA-PET scan along with a standard radiographic response assessment with images taken at baseline and then periodically throughout the course of treatment. The primary endpoint is to evaluate effect on PSA, defined as greater than or equal to a 50% decline in PSA level by 12 weeks after first treatment with FPI-2265. Secondary objectives include radiographic response rate, safety and tolerability, based on frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters. Clinical analyses for primary and secondary endpoints will be performed separately for patients who have received previous treatment with 177Lu-PSMA radio-ligand therapies and for those who have not received previous 177Lu-PSMA radio-ligand therapy.
Prior to our acquisition of the asset, RadioMedix had enrolled 11 patients. Limited preliminary data from 10 of these patients was available as of late January 2023. All of these patients were 177Lu-PSMA therapy naïve and, in general, heavily pretreated with multiple lines of prior anti-cancer treatment, including anti-androgen therapy, chemotherapy, Xofigo, PARP

inhibitors, immunotherapy, and experimental therapies which varied widely across this group of patients. The following patient characteristics were noted in order to help interpretation of the preliminary safety and efficacy findings:
•two patients had an adverse prognostic features of ECOG Performance status 2 and liver metastases; 
 •two additional patients were enrolled with blood counts below those prespecified in the eligibility criteria, limiting the interpretability of the safety findings; and 
 •one patient had PSA< 1 ng/ml at study entry, limiting the PSA response assessment.
 In December 2022, the study protocol was amended to exclude patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, or ECOG, performance (a measure of functional status) status greater than or equal to Grade 2 and patients with liver metastases. Furthermore, guidance for dose de-escalation were clarified.
Among the 10 patients with at least one post-baseline PSA value measurement, four patients achieved a PSA50 response; of eight patients evaluable for PSA50 response at week eight, four (50%) achieved a sustained decline.

Of seven patients evaluable for radiographic response assessment per the widely accepted response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, known as RECIST 1.1, at the time of review:
•one patient had a complete response; 
 •one patient had a confirmed partial response; 
 •one patient had an unconfirmed partial response; 
 •three patients had stable disease; and 
 •one patient had disease progression. 
 Five of these seven patients had post-baseline PSMA-PET scans, one achieved a complete response, two demonstrated a decline in standardized uptake value, or SUV, greater than 30%, and two demonstrated a decline in SUV of less than 30%.

One patient with extensive skeletal metastases who achieved a complete radiographic response (by Tc-bone scan and PSMA-PET scan) also showed a substantial decline in PSA (1119 to 2.43 ng/ml) that was sustained (see graphic below).
    Based on the preliminary safety data, 225Ac-PSMA-I&T was generally well tolerated. Notably, and as expected based on previously reported clinical trials, the majority of patients (eight of nine patients) reported related adverse events, or AE, of dry mouth, or xerostomia, of whom one patient experienced a Grade 2 event while the other seven patients experienced low grade (Grade 1) xerostomia. Grade 1 dry eye was reported in two patients. Reported hematological AEs that were deemed related to study drug include: anemia (six of nine patients), absolute neutrophil count, or ANC, decrease (two of nine patients) and thrombocytopenia (two of nine patients). Both instances of high grade (Grades 3 and 4) thrombocytopenia were reported as serious. One patient with Grade 4 drug-related thrombocytopenia experienced intracranial bleeding that resulted in the patient being withdrawn from further study treatments. A second patient developed Grade 3 thrombocytopenia for which attribution to study drug had not been established at the time of the data review in late January 2023. Both patients who experienced these thrombocytopenic events had Grade 3 AEs of anemia reported. Although two events of creatinine increase were reported, they were deemed unrelated to the study drug.
 Upon transfer of the IND from RadioMedix to us, we intend to expand the Phase 2 clinical trial across multiple sites. We expect to report preliminary data for the first 20-30 patients in this study, including safety and efficacy data, in the first quarter of 2024.
 FPI-1434: Targeting IGF-1R
 Overview
 Our second most advanced product candidate, FPI-1434, is designed to target IGF-1R, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple types of common solid tumors, including ovarian, sarcoma, head and neck, prostate, non-small cell lung, colorectal and liver cancers, among other cancers, as shown in the table below, making it a potentially attractive target for cancer therapies. The overexpression of IGF-1R has been reported to be associated with faster disease progression, poor prognosis, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. IGF-1R is a well-established tumor target, but historical attempts to suppress tumor growth or enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapies by inhibiting the IGF-1R signaling pathway were unsuccessful in the clinic. Previous development of therapeutics focused on blocking the IGF-1R signaling pathway with an anti-IGF-1R antibody, either directly or through its downstream effectors. The development of these product candidates was hampered by limited efficacy, due to a variety of factors, including the tumor’s ability to upregulate compensatory growth mechanisms. For FPI-1434, we have designed the product candidate to employ the IGF-1R antibody as a means to identify, target and deliver our alpha emitting payload to the tumor, and the mechanism of action does not depend
12


on the IGF-1R signaling pathway to kill the tumor. Furthermore, the amount of protein administered for a TAT like FPI-1434, is significantly less than the amount used in trials on the naked antibody.
 We in-licensed AVE-1642, an antibody from Immunogen, Inc., or Immunogen, that had previously been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in collaboration with Sanofi S.A., as both a monotherapy and combination therapy, in a variety of IGF-1R positive tumors. Approximately 140 patients received AVE-1642 in clinical trials. Although the antibody was observed to be well-tolerated with positive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, it failed to demonstrate sufficient therapeutic efficacy and further development was terminated. Because we are utilizing the antibody only as a way to identify and deliver the 225Ac payload into the tumor and the mechanism of action of FPI-1434 does not depend on the IGF-1R signaling pathway to kill the tumor, we do not believe that the lack of efficacy observed for the antibody itself in previous trials will impact the potential anti-tumor activity of FPI-1434.
In our preclinical studies, we observed that FPI-1434 penetrated solid tumors, delivered the alpha particle to the tumor site and created dose-dependent double-strand DNA breaks. We are currently evaluating FPI-1434 as a monotherapy in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with IGF-1R positive solid tumors to assess its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics as well as to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose. As part of the screening process, patients are administered the imaging analogue of FPI-1434, which utilizes the same linker and targeting molecule, but replaces 225Ac with the radioactive isotope 111In and only those patients who meet predefined tumor uptake and dosimetry, and show organ radiation exposure within the limits of established standards for normal organ radiation tolerability, are advanced into the trial. In our ongoing Phase 1 trial, we are exploring various dosing levels of FPI-1434 in two dosing regimens: one with FPI-1434 alone, and another in which a small dose of cold antibody (naked IGF-1R antibody without the isotope) is administered prior to the imaging analogue and prior to each dose of FPI-1434. We are exploring the impact of administering the cold IGF-1R antibody prior to the imaging analogue and prior to each dose of FPI-1434 on the biodistribution, safety and tumor uptake. We refer to this dosing regimen as the “cold/hot” dosing regimen; we refer to the dosing regimen of FPI-1434 without pre-administration of the cold antibody as the “hot only” dosing regimen. The introduction of this “cold/hot” dosing regimen resulted, in part, from a CASS, that was performed as part of the Phase 1 study, whereby a small amount of cold IGF-1R antibody was administered prior to administration of the imaging analogue only. In the CASS we treated five (5) patients at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and/or 1.5 mg/kg of cold IGF-1R antibody and saw, in general, an improved lesion uptake in most patients who received the cold IGF-1R antibody pre-administration and the lesion uptake was independent of anatomic location (including bone, mediastinum, lung, liver, and lymph nodes). Results at 0.5 mg/kg were generally more favorable than the 1.5 mg/kg dose of cold antibody. Imaging with the pre-administration of the cold antibody was well tolerated. As a result of the CASS data, we are prioritizing the cold/hot dosing regimen over the hot only dosing regimen. We are currently prioritizing patient enrollment into the “cold/hot” dosing regimen. We anticipate reporting Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetics, and imaging data, including any evidence of anti-tumor activity, and details on the dosing regimen in the second quarter of 2023.
 FPI-1434 as a Monotherapy
Overview of Preclinical Development
In preclinical studies, FPI-1434 was able to cause tumor regression in a dose-dependent manner by delivering 225Ac to the tumor site and creating multiple double-strand DNA breaks. At higher doses, FPI-1434 was able to eradicate tumors with a single dose. Our targeting antibody was able to deliver 225Ac to the tumor site and create multiple double-strand DNA breaks that increased over time and were pervasive throughout the tumor. An imaging analogue of FPI-1434 was able to bind with high selectivity to its target in a variety of different tumor types, and in a manner that was approximately proportional to the amount of target expressed on the surface of cancer cells. In addition, there was no noticeable effect observed in our preclinical studies on the biological function of the antibody as a result of connecting the naked antibody to 225Ac with our Fast-Clear linker to form FPI-1434. We believe that the data generated from these preclinical studies demonstrates the potential of FPI-1434 as a monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of cancers.
Ongoing Phase 1 Trial of FPI-1434
We are currently conducting a Phase 1, non-randomized, multi-center, open-label clinical trial in patients with solid tumors expressing IGF-1R to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FPI-1434 as well as to establish the MTD and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose and dosing regimen.
As part of the screening process for the trial, all patients are administered a single injection of 185 megabecquerel, or MBq, of FPI-1547, the imaging analogue of FPI-1434 which contains 111In instead of 225Ac, and SPECT and planar imaging is used to evaluate tumor uptake of the imaging isotope. In accordance with the trial protocol, patients that meet predefined uptake
13


and dosimetry criteria for FPI-1547 are advanced into the trial and administered FPI-1434 within approximately fourteen days of receiving the imaging analogue.
We have completed evaluation of single escalating doses of 10 kBq/kg, 20 kBq/kg, and 40 kBq/kg of FPI-1434 across three cohorts in a total of 12 patients. In December 2020, we dosed the first patient in the multi-dosing portion of the Phase 1 study. We continued to explore various dosing levels in two dosing regimens (the hot only and cold/hot dosing regimens) in this study.
Four select examples of transaxial SPECT images from the single-dose portion of the study are shown below. The colored portions in the lesions show uptake of FPI-1547 by the tumor, with the more brightly colored portions indicating higher uptake levels. Based on the dosimetry data from patients administered FPI-1547 in the single-dose portion of the study, we believe that the highest dose levels of FPI-1434 that we are evaluating in the multi-dose portion of the clinical trial are likely to be below the maximum tolerated limits of radiation exposure to the kidneys, liver and lungs.

Images are from selected patients. Although all 13 patients dosed with FPI-1547 met our predefined uptake and dosimetry criteria, the levels of tumor uptake and dosimetry varied by patient. These images are not necessarily indicative of expected uptake and dosimetry for every patient.
In the first two cohorts of patients administered both FPI-1547 and FPI-1434, we assessed the plasma pharmacokinetics of these patients by measuring the total radioactivity of either 111In or 225Ac, respectively. We converted the radioactivity measurements to nanogram-equivalents of protein per gram of plasma to enable us to conduct the pharmacokinetic analysis. As shown below, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters suggest antibody-like distribution and an elimination half-life in the range of one to two days at the doses administered.

FPI-1434 as a Combination Therapy
Overview of Combination with Immunotherapies
The rationale for the combination FPI-1434 with approved immunotherapies stems from the documented immune-stimulating properties of EBRT and the benefits observed in the preclinical models of EBRT in combination with immunotherapies. When radiation destroys tumor cells, it leads to the release of tumor-associated antigens and concomitant maturation of APCs. Mature APCs loaded with the newly acquired tumor antigens then travel to the secondary lymphoid organs where they present them to naïve T cells, triggering their activation, proliferation and trafficking to tumor sites, even in the absence of the targeted antigen. In preclinical studies, we observed a synergistic effect on tumor suppression when using FPI-1434 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Based on our preclinical combination studies, we believe that there is an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of approved checkpoint inhibitors in certain tumors by combining their use with FPI-1434 as well as the potential to move the use of FPI-1434 to earlier lines of therapy. In anticipation of filing an IND for these combination therapies, we are conducting additional preclinical studies of FPI-1434 and mouse analogues in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors to further assess the anti-tumor activity, dosing schedule and pharmacodynamics of the combinations. We plan to use the data gathered from these studies to support the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of FPI-1434 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors. We anticipate initiation of a Phase 1 combination study with FPI-1434 and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) to occur six to nine months following determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose of FPI-1434 monotherapy in connection with a collaboration agreement executed in May 2021 with Merck.
 Preclinical Immunotherapy Combination Studies
In multiple preclinical studies, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of combination therapies using FPI-1792, a murine version of the IGF-1R antibody connected to 225Ac through our Fast-Clear linker, with and without approved checkpoint inhibitors. In these studies, we used a syngeneic CT26 colon cancer model, which is considered to be moderately immunogenic. To evaluate anti-tumor activity, mice were subcutaneously implanted with CT26 cells and, once tumors reached 175 mm3, the mice were treated with either one injection of vehicle, three injections of an anti-CTLA-4 alone on days 1, 4 and 7, eight injections of an anti-PD-1 alone every 3-4 days, one injection of FPI-1792 alone or the respective combinations. We detected only transient and partial suppression of tumor growth in mice treated with either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 alone as compared to the vehicle-treated controls. In mice that received FPI-1792 as a monotherapy, we observed a more pronounced and stable

tumor growth suppression through day 28 than mice treated with either checkpoint inhibitor alone. In the combination groups, 13 out of 15 mice demonstrated tumor regression in excess of what was observed in the FPI-1792-only group at day 28.

To further investigate whether mice with regressing tumors would reject a secondary tumor formation, all of the surviving mice from the FPI-1792 monotherapy and combination groups in the study described above were re-challenged with CT26 cells at day 28, when there would be little to no effect remaining from the first administration of FPI-1792. Previously untreated mice were used as controls for this experiment. Neither the previously treated or untreated mice received any additional treatment during the re-challenge period. We observed that all of the untreated mice demonstrated exponential tumor growth, but rejection of the secondary tumor occurred in 13 out of 15 mice previously treated with either FPI-1792 alone or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, as shown below. We believe that the tumor rejection in the absence of continued treatment of the mice demonstrates that protective immunity was induced by treatment with FPI-1792. The results of this study also support the development of the potential alpha emitting therapy-mediated immune response, which we believe supports the potential of FPI-1434 to create a vaccination effect that synergizes with checkpoint inhibitors and leads to primary tumor shrinkage as well as secondary tumor rejection.
13 of 15 Animals Showed No Growth of a Secondary Tumor


To further evaluate the mechanism of action of FPI-1434 that we believe is responsible for the tumor suppression in re-challenged animals, we collected tissues from the control and combination therapy groups 14 days post-tumor re-challenge. Tumors were assessed for both T cell recruitment and presence of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells within the tumors. As shown in the graphs below, enumeration of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor revealed a very high frequency of AH1+ cells, the tumor-associated antigen given off by dying tumors, in 30% to 70% of the treated mice as compared to 2% to 3% in the control mice. We believe these data suggest that treating the mice with FPI-1792 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors can break T cell tolerance and elicit a strong CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response that is able to reject tumors when re-challenged.
T Cell Recruitment and Antigen-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Tumors 14 Days after Tumor Re-Challenge


Overview of Combination with DDRis
We are also exploring the potential of combining FPI-1434 with DDRis such as PARP inhibitors. PARP is part of several cellular mechanisms that repair DNA damage, including single-strand and double-strand DNA breaks. In cancer patients with pre-existing genetic defects in double-strand DNA break repair, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in ovarian or breast cancer, the PARP pathway becomes a primary DNA repair system. In such patients, PARP inhibitors result in blockage of DNA repair, which causes cell death. Approved PARP inhibitors include olaparib, talazoparib and niraparib. We believe that using FPI-1434 in combination with a PARP inhibitor to inhibit repair of alpha particle mediated DNA damage may work synergistically to increase the lethal DNA damage load on treated tumors and potentially improve the tolerability profile. In addition, the combination has the potential to expand the current patient population addressed by PARP inhibitors, which generally require the presence of a specific mutation such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, to include patients without pre-existing mutations. We are conducting additional preclinical studies of FPI-1434 in combination with DDRis, such as approved PARP inhibitors, to further assess the anti-tumor activity, dosing schedule and pharmacodynamics of the combinations. We plan to use the data gathered from these studies to support the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of FPI-1434 in combination with approved PARP inhibitors. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for this combination approximately six to nine months after identifying the recommended Phase 2 dose for our ongoing monotherapy Phase 1 clinical trial of FPI-1434.
Preclinical PARP Inhibitor Combination Studies
In multiple preclinical studies, we have evaluated potential synergies between FPI-1434 and olaparib using preclinical tumor models with no pre-existing mutations in DNA repair and have observed that olaparib in combination with FPI-1434 can provide benefits where DNA damage is being generated directly by FPI-1434.
In one study, we evaluated subtherapeutic doses of 37 kBq/kg of FPI-1434 and 25 mg/kg of olaparib in a preclinical colorectal tumor model (n=5 in each dose group or vehicle group). A single dose of FPI-1434 was administered on day zero and olaparib was dosed on days 1 and 2 and thereafter on a five days on, two days off cycle for the remainder of the 30-day treatment period. Despite the non-therapeutic doses of each therapy used, the combination of the two nontherapeutic doses had a strong synergistic effect and inhibited tumor growth during the 47-day study period. We observed that olaparib in combination with FPI-1434 can provide additional therapeutic benefits where DNA damage is being generated directly by FPI-1434, even in the absence of a pre-existing mutation.
Relative Tumor Volume in Colorectal Mouse Model


Similar results were seen in a non-small cell lung cancer model, suggesting that the mechanism can be applied to multiple tumor types where mutations in DNA repair are absent. In both models, we observed that the strongest combination effect appeared to occur at the lower single agent doses, supporting our hypothesis that the addition of PARP inhibition may allow for efficacy at lower doses of FPI-1434. We believe that these data support the evaluation of a PARP inhibitor plus FPI-1434 combination therapy in the clinical setting.
FPI-1966: Targeting FGFR3
 We designed FPI-1966 to target and deliver 225Ac to tumor sites expressing FGFR3, a protein that is overexpressed in multiple cancers including colorectal, ovarian, bladder, and head and neck cancers. FPI-1966 utilizes our Fast-Clear linker to connect a human monoclonal antibody that targets FGFR3 with 225Ac. We acquired the rights to vofatamab from Rainier Therapeutics, Inc. (f/k/a BioClin Therapeutics, Inc.), or Rainier, who had licensed the molecule from Genentech. Rainier had previously evaluated vofatamab as a therapeutic agent in a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and a Phase 1/2(b) trial in combination with docetaxel, to determine safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Although the antibody was observed to be well-tolerated in approximately 140 patients across several studies, it failed to demonstrate sufficient positive therapeutic efficacy to warrant further development. Because we are utilizing the antibody only as a way to identify, target and deliver the 225Ac payload into the tumor and because the mechanism of action of FPI-1966 does not depend on the FGFR3 signaling pathway to kill the tumor, we do not believe that the lack of sufficient efficacy observed for the antibody itself in previous trials will impact the potential anti-tumor activity of FPI-1966. Currently there is an approved pan-FGFR inhibitor for the treatment of bladder cancer, though it is limited to cancers with specific genetic alterations. We believe our TAT therapy will enable targeting FGFR3-expressing cancers, independent of those genetic mutations with minimal resistance due to the mechanism of action of alpha radiation.
In preclinical studies, we observed pre-dosing with cold antibody (naked vofatamab without the isotope) increases circulating FPI-1966, to drive enhanced tumor lesion uptake. The addition of vofatamab to the dosing regimen acts to reduce specific and non-specific binding of the radiolabeled antibody to normal tissue. This in turn allows for increased FPI-1966 concentrations in the blood allowing more FPI-1966 to bind to the tumor. We have performed studies preclinically to optimize both the co-dosing and pre-dosing regimens of vofatamab prior to administering FPI-1966. The results from the optimized dosing regimen of FPI-1966 and vofatamab is shown below. The data shows that a slower blood clearance and higher tumor uptake can be observed with the optimized regimen.


This regimen when administered in mouse efficacy studies demonstrates single-dose, dose-dependent tumor regression in a model of bladder cancer.
 
We submitted INDs for FPI-1966 and FPI-1967, as the imaging analogue, in the second quarter of 2021 and announced FDA clearance of the INDs in July 2021. The Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial of FPI-1966 in patients with solid tumors expressing FGFR3, intended to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose, has been initiated with study sites open to patient recruitment. We dosed the first patient in August 2022 and plan to provide a clinical update in 2024.


As part of the screening process for the trial, all patients will be administered a single injection of FPI-1967, the imaging analogue of FPI-1966, with or without vofatamab and imaging will be used to evaluate tumor uptake of the imaging isotope. In accordance with the trial protocol, patients that meet predefined uptake and dosimetry criteria will be advanced into the trial. The first cohort of the study will evaluate the potential impact of the cold antibody (naked vofatamab without the isotope) on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry by exploring cold antibody doses of 0mgs/kg to 10mgs/kg in up to four sub-cohorts prior to administration of FPI-1966 at 10kBq/kg. The cold antibody dosing level, if any, that demonstrates the optimal increase in tumor lesion uptake and safety profile will be used in all subsequent multiple dose escalation cohorts of FPI-1966 ranging from 20kBq/kg to 100kBq/kg in a standard three-by-three clinical trial design utilizing a six-week dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period.
 FPI-2059: Targeting NTSR1
 On April 1, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ipsen to acquire Ipsen's intellectual property and assets related to IPN-1087. IPN-1087 is a 177Lu-based small molecule radiopharmaceutical targeting NTSR1; a protein expressed on multiple solid tumor types. We have combined our expertise and TAT platform with IPN-1087 to create an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical, FPI-2059, targeting solid tumors expressing NTSR1.
Preclinical data with an 225Ac labeled form of IPN-1087 previously demonstrated single dose tumor kill. In addition, existing human imaging studies and experience with IPN-1087 as a beta emitter showed promising safety and imaging data which we believe can be leveraged and enhanced by converting it to the alpha emitter. Based upon the known expression of NTSR1 and existing imaging data showing high uptake, we believe there are opportunities to address several cancers, including colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. We also believe there is an opportunity with FPI-2059 to address neuroendocrine differentiated, or NED, prostate cancer, where there are currently limited treatment options.
 The FDA cleared our IND for FPI-2059 and the corresponding imaging analogue, FPI-2058, in June 2022. Study initiation activities are ongoing in a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial of FPI-2059 in patients with solid tumors expressing NTSR1, intended to investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose. Eligible participants will have one of the following advanced, metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, neuroendocrine differentiated prostate cancer or Ewing sarcoma. We plan to provide guidance on timelines for the FPI-2059 program following site activations and initial experience with patient screening and patient enrollment.
 FPI-2068
 In January 2022, we announced the nomination of the first TAT candidate under the strategic collaboration agreement, a bispecific antibody owned by AstraZeneca radiolabeled with 225Ac utilizing our Fast-Clear linker technology, which we refer to as FPI-2068. In addition, we and AstraZeneca will exclusively explore up to five combination strategies involving our existing assets, including our FPI-1434 and FPI-1966 product candidates, and AstraZeneca therapeutics, for the treatment of various cancers. Each party will retain full rights to their respective assets.
 Early-Stage Pipeline
 In January 2022, we entered into two separate strategic research collaborations to discover novel, peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of various solid tumors. Under the agreements, Fusion has global rights to develop and commercialize any peptides discovered under either collaboration.
 To further expand our pipeline, we plan to continue to in-license additional targeting molecules for the development of TATs that are in various stages of discovery and preclinical development.
Relationship with CPDC
We were founded in 2014 to advance certain intellectual property relating to radiopharmaceuticals that had been developed by CPDC. We believe CPDC is a recognized leader in the field of radiopharmaceutical manufacturing. CPDC was funded as a Centre of Excellence for Commercialization Research under the Canadian federal government’s Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research, or CECR, program.
Following the time of our incorporation, some of our non-voting common shares were allocated to certain CPDC employees. We also were a party to a Master Services Agreement and Supply Agreement with CPDC, pursuant to which CPDC
20


provided products and services to us, including preclinical and manufacturing services, administrative support services, access to laboratory facilities and laboratory technicians and products for human safety and efficacy clinical trials. In connection with the Company entering into a lease for a manufacturing facility in Hamilton, Ontario, we entered into an agreement with CPDC to train personnel. In August 2022, CPDC transferred and assigned all agreements (including the Master Services Agreement and the Supply Agreement) other than the license agreements with the Company to a third-party CDMO known as AtomVie.
 Manufacturing and Supply of 225Ac
 For clinical supply, we use CDMOs who comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, for the manufacture of our drug product, in particular, our targeting molecules. We have recently transitioned the cGMP manufacturing of our Fast-Clear linkers to a CDMO. Currently, we contract with the DoE and other third-parties to supply us with 225Ac and are exploring other potential sources for 225Ac. We currently rely on CDMOs to receive the components of our TATs and to assemble and manufacture the finished TATs pursuant to Master Services Agreements. The CDMOs then deliver the finished product candidates to global clinical sites, including those in Canada, the United States and Australia.
 In June 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Hamilton, Ontario-based McMaster University for approximately 27,000 square feet of space at our current headquarters for the purpose of establishing a manufacturing facility to supplement our drug product manufacturing capacity at CDMOs. We expect that construction of our own manufacturing facility will provide us with enhanced control of material supply for preclinical studies, clinical trials, and commercialization, enable more rapid implementation of process changes, and allow for better long-term margins if any of our product candidates successfully complete clinical trials and receive marketing approval. Although we are in the process of establishing our own manufacturing facility which is expected to be operational in 2024, we expect to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and the production of all clinical supply in the near term.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies as well as public and private research institutions.
In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of radiopharmaceuticals. Early results from these trials have fueled continued interest in radiopharmaceuticals, which is being pursued by several biotechnology companies as well as by large pharmaceutical companies.
We consider our most direct competitors to be companies developing targeted alpha radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer. There are several companies developing targeted alpha-based radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer, including Bayer AG, or Bayer, Novartis AG, or Novartis, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Orano Med, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited and POINT Biopharma Inc. as well as several early-stage companies who recently entered the field such as RayzeBio, Inc., Aktis Oncology and Mariana Oncology. These companies are targeting a wide range of solid and hematologic malignancies using various alpha emitting isotopes, including Radium-223, Lead-212, Actinium-225 and Thorium-227. The first and only approved alpha particle-based therapy is Bayer’s Xofigo, a salt of radium that cannot easily and robustly be attached to a targeting molecule, but naturally localizes to regions where cancer cells are infiltrating bone. Xofigo was approved in the United States by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of bone metastases associated with prostate cancer.
There are several companies with approved beta-based radiopharmaceuticals, including Novartis, Bayer, Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and Q BioMed Inc. The beta emitting isotopes used by these companies include Iodine-131, Lutetium-177, Strontium-89 and Yttrium-90. Beta particle emitting radiopharmaceuticals, such as Novartis’ Lutathera and Pluvicto, were approved in recent years for the treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancers and PSMA-positive metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, respectively. There are other beta particle-based radiopharmaceuticals in various stages of clinical development by companies including Novartis AG, Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc. and POINT Biopharma Global Inc.
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials,

obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and materials complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than our product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of imaging agents, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our platform technology, product candidates and know-how, to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, to preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have filed an Inter Partes Review, or IPR, petition with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to challenge the validity of a certain issued U.S. patent. In the event that we are unsuccessful in the IPR and that such patent has not expired at the time of approval of FPI-2265, our PSMA I&T product candidate, and if the patent owners were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that FPI-2265, our PSMA I&T product candidate, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, in order to prevail we would need to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of non-infringement or invalidity. In the event that a patent is successfully asserted against us such that the patent is found to be valid and enforceable and infringed by FPI-2265, our PSMA I&T product candidate or its use, unless we obtain a license to such a patent, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be prevented from continuing to develop or commercialize our product.
 We seek to protect our product candidates and technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing of third-party intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We, or our collaborators and licensors, file patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions to protect our product candidates as well as uses of our product candidates for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases.
As of March 6, 2023, our patent estate that we own and in-licensed includes at least 12 issued U.S. patents, at least 19 pending U.S. patent applications, at least 66 issued foreign patents, at least 143 pending foreign patent applications and at least 16 pending international Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications.

Collaboration and License Agreements
AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement
In October 2020, we and AstraZeneca entered into a strategic collaboration agreement, or the AstraZeneca Agreement, pursuant to which we and AstraZeneca will jointly discover, develop and commercialize novel TATs and combination therapies for the treatment of cancer globally by leveraging our TAT platform and expertise in radiopharmaceuticals with AstraZeneca’s leading portfolio of antibodies and cancer therapeutics, including DDRis. Each party retains full ownership over its existing assets.
For the novel TATs, the parties will utilize our Fast-Clear linker technology to bind the alpha-emitting isotope 225Ac to certain antibodies in AstraZeneca’s oncology portfolio to develop up to three novel TATs. We will take the operational lead on preclinical development and clinical studies aimed at establishing safety for the novel TATs, referred to as the Stage 1 Development, while AstraZeneca will be responsible for subsequent clinical development, referred to as the Stage 2 Development. We and AstraZeneca will share development costs equally (with each party responsible for the cost of its own supply in connection with such development). Either party has the right to opt out of the co-development and co-commercialization arrangement at pre-determined timepoints and obtain exclusive rights to a novel TAT in exchange for milestone payments to the other party of up to $145.0 million per novel TAT and a low or high single-digit royalties on future sales (depending on the opt out time point). If neither party opts out, and unless otherwise agreed by the parties, AstraZeneca will lead worldwide commercialization activities for the novel TATs, subject to our option to co-promote the TATs in the U.S. All profits and losses resulting from such commercialization activities will be shared equally. In January 2022, we announced the nomination of the first TAT candidate under the AstraZeneca Agreement: a bispecific antibody owned by AstraZeneca radiolabeled with 225Ac utilizing our Fast-Clear linker technology, which we refer to as FPI-2068.
For the combination therapies, the parties will evaluate up to five potential combination strategies involving either FPI-1434 or FPI-1966 in combination with certain of AstraZeneca’s existing therapeutics for the treatment of various cancers.

AstraZeneca will fully fund all research and development activities for the combination strategies, until such point as we may opt-in to the clinical development activities. We have the right to opt-out of clinical development activities relating to these combination therapies. In such instance, we will be responsible for repaying our share of the development costs via a royalty on the additional combination sales only if our drug is approved on the basis of clinical development solely conducted by AstraZeneca, in which case the royalty payments shall also include a variable risk premium based on the number of our product candidates to have received regulatory approval at that time. Each party will have the sole right, on a country-by-country basis, to commercialize its respective contributed compound as a component of any combination therapy for which such party’s contributed compound may be commercialized under a separate marketing authorization from the other party’s contributed compound to such combination therapy. The parties will negotiate in good faith on a combination therapy-by-combination therapy basis the terms and conditions to co-commercialize any combination therapy that is to be commercialized under a single marketing authorization. During the period of time commencing with the inclusion of an available molecular target in the selection pool for development as a combination therapy and ending upon the end of the nomination period or earlier removal of such combination target from such pool, we will not undertake any preclinical or clinical studies combining our TAT Platform with any compound modulating the activity of such combination target. Following selection of a target under the AstraZeneca Agreement and payment of an exclusivity fee by AstraZeneca, and provided that AstraZeneca enrolls its first patient in a clinical trial as further defined in the AstraZeneca Agreement within a pre-defined period of time of such selection, we will not undertake any preclinical or clinical studies combining our TAT Platform with compounds modulating the same combination target for the duration of the evaluation period for such combination target, as further defined in the AstraZeneca Agreement. Within a certain time period following initiation of the evaluation period with respect to a combination target, AstraZeneca has the exclusive right to undertake, alone or in collaboration with us, all further clinical or preclinical combination studies with respect to a combination target by paying certain exclusivity fees.
We received an upfront payment of $5.0 million from AstraZeneca. In addition, we are eligible to receive future payments of up to $40.0 million, including clinical milestones. The AstraZeneca Agreement expires on a TAT-by-TAT and combination-by-combination basis upon the later of the expiration of development and exclusivity obligations relating to such TAT or combination or, if such TAT or combination is commercialized as a product under the AstraZeneca Agreement, the expiration of the commercial life of such product. We and AstraZeneca can each terminate the AstraZeneca Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach following the applicable notice period. Each of us and AstraZeneca may also terminate the AstraZeneca Agreement with respect to any TAT or combination product if such party determines that the continued development of such TAT or combination product is not commercially viable, or for a material safety issue with respect to such TAT or combination product.
 License Agreement with the Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization
 In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement with the CPDC, or the CPDC License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired a worldwide, exclusive license to (i) all of CPDC’s patents and patent applications throughout the world covering or relating to the technology owned or licensable by CPDC relating to its IGF-1R program and the associated novel linker technology, which we refer to as the CPDC Technology and (ii) all of CPDC’s technical information related to the CPDC Technology, including the right to sublicense any or all such rights to the CPDC Technology.
As consideration for the license, we paid CPDC a nominal fee. We are not required to pay CPDC any royalties or milestones for the use of the CPDC Technology.
The CPDC License Agreement will remain in effect until terminated. Either party may terminate the CPDC License Agreement in the event that the other party is in default of any of its obligation under the CPDC License Agreement and such default is not remedied within 60 days of receiving notice of such default.
License Agreement with ImmunoGen, Inc.
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with ImmunoGen, or the ImmunoGen License Agreement. Pursuant to the ImmunoGen License Agreement, we acquired a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable royalty-bearing license to use, develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit any radiopharmaceutical conjugate that includes or incorporates ImmunoGen’s monoclonal antibody that targets IGF-1R and the related amino acid sequence, and any antibody derived therefrom, including the naked antibody we utilize in FPI-1434, which we refer to as the ImmunoGen Product, for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, control and maintenance of all diseases and disorders.
Pursuant to the ImmunoGen License Agreement, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for the ImmunoGen Product in the United States and in at least one of Canada, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, Spain or the United Kingdom. If regulatory approval is obtained, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the ImmunoGen Product in each country where the regulatory approval is obtained. We will be solely responsible for the costs associated with development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization of any products.
After completion of any Phase 2 clinical trial of any product covered by the ImmunoGen License Agreement and upon the first to occur of (i) our undertaking of good faith efforts to identify potential licensees or collaborators to develop and commercialize any product covered by the ImmunoGen License Agreement or (ii) the delivery of data with respect to such Phase 2 clinical trial, ImmunoGen will have an exclusive right of first negotiation to obtain rights to develop or commercialize the product in North America, provided that neither party shall have the obligation to enter into such a license. If ImmunoGen does not exercise its option during the specified period, then we have the right to license the product for development or commercialization in North America to a third party. If ImmunoGen exercises its option, but we do not enter into any such license agreement, ImmunoGen’s right of first negotiation expires.
As initial consideration for the license, we paid ImmunoGen an upfront fee of $0.2 million. In addition, we will be required to pay ImmunoGen up to an aggregate of $15.0 million in specified development and regulatory milestones and up to $35.0 million in specified sales milestones. We are also obligated to pay ImmunoGen tiered, low to mid-single-digit royalties of total worldwide sales of the ImmunoGen Product on a country-by-country basis. For product sales in the U.S., the royalty term will run for 10 years following the first commercial sale and, for product sales outside the U.S., the royalty term will run for five years following the first sale.
Unless earlier terminated, the ImmunoGen License Agreement will expire at the end of the last royalty period described above. Either party may terminate for the uncured breach by the other party and upon the other party filing for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings. In addition, until we receive regulatory approval of any product utilizing the ImmunoGen Product, we may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. Following receipt of regulatory approval, we may terminate the agreement at any time upon 180 days’ prior written notice to ImmunoGen.
Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement and Genentech License Agreement
In March 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rainier, or the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired substantially all the assets of Rainier in consideration for an upfront cash payment of $1.0 million, which was paid at the closing, or the Closing. Unless the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated pursuant its terms, which termination initially could not have occurred later than eight months following the Closing, or the Outside Date, we were obligated to pay Rainier an additional amount of $3.5 million and to issue 313,359 of our common shares on the Outside Date. If the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement was not terminated by the Outside Date, we were also obligated to make aggregate milestone payments to Rainier of up to $22.5 million and issue up to 156,679 of our common shares upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, of which a $2.0 million milestone payment and the issuance of 156,679 common shares are due upon the first patient dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of FPI-1966, and of up to $42.0 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones.
In the event we enter into a transaction with a non-affiliated party relating to the license or sale of substantially all our rights to develop the specified compound of antibody molecules, we will be required to pay Rainier a specified percentage of the revenue from such transaction, in an amount ranging from 10% to 30%, based on how long after the Closing the transaction takes place.
The Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement could have been terminated at any time prior to the Outside Date upon 30 days’ notice by us to Rainier or upon the mutual written consent of both parties. On October 8, 2020, we entered into a first amendment to the Rainier Agreement, or the First Amended Rainier Agreement, to extend certain terms of the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement. Specifically, the Outside Date, was amended such that termination may not occur later than eleven months following the Closing, or February 10, 2021, or the Revised Outside Date. On February 8, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the First Amended Rainier Agreement, as amended, or the Second Amended Rainier Agreement. Pursuant to the Second Amended Rainier Agreement, the Outside Date was further amended such that termination may not occur later than July 1, 2021, and such amendment was made in consideration for early payment of the additional $3.5 million owed to Rainier. On May 26, 2021, we notified Rainier of our intent to continue development of the asset and issued 313,359 of our common shares to Rainier on July 1, 2021. In August 2022, we announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 study of FPI-1966 and paid a $2.0 million milestone payment and issued 156,679 common shares to Rainier.

In connection with the Rainier Asset Purchase Agreement, in March 2020, we were assigned all of Rainier’s rights and obligations under an exclusive license agreement, dated December 26, 2012, between BioClin Therapeutics, Inc. and Genentech, Inc., or the Genentech License Agreement. Pursuant to the Genentech License Agreement, we have an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to make, use, research, develop, sell and import certain intellectual property and technology of Genentech relating to vofatamab, an antibody targeted to FGFR3, and a mutant antibody thereof, or the Licensed Antibodies, including any products that contain a Licensed Antibody as an active ingredient, or Products, for all human uses.
Pursuant to the Genentech License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one Product and we are solely responsible for the costs associated with the development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization of any Products. The manufacture of the antibody by any third-party CDMO must be approved in advance by Genentech. Additionally, Genentech retains the right to use the Licensed Antibodies solely to research and develop molecules other than the Licensed Antibodies.
We are required to pay Genentech milestone payments of up to $44.0 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones.
We are obligated to pay Genentech tiered royalties ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a high single-digit percentage on worldwide net sales of Products containing the antibody (rather than the mutant antibody), and tiered royalties of a different mid to high single-digit range on worldwide net sales of Products containing the mutant antibody. For Products that are not covered by an enforceable patent in the country in which they are sold, we are obligated to pay a low single-digit royalty on sales in such country until the end of the royalty term. The royalty payments may be subject to deductions in the event we obtain a license under a third-party patent that covers the Licensed Antibody contained in the Product.
Our obligation to pay royalties begins on the date of first commercial sale of a Product and expires upon the later of 10 years or the date the Product is no longer covered by an enforceable patent.
Unless earlier terminated, the Genentech License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty and milestone payment obligations. Either party may terminate the Genentech License Agreement as follows: (i) if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within 90 days of receiving notice thereof or (ii) in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. In addition, we may terminate the Genentech License Agreement for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice if we determine in our sole discretion that development or commercialization of Products is not economically or scientifically feasible or appropriate.
Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement
On March 1, 2021, we announced that we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ipsen, or the Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired Ipsen’s intellectual property and assets related to IPN-1087, a small molecule targeting NTSR1, a protein expressed on multiple solid tumor types. We intend to combine our expertise and proprietary TAT platform with IPN-1087 to create an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical targeting solid tumors expressing NTSR1. The acquisition closed on April 1, 2021.
Upon closing of the asset acquisition, we paid €0.6 million ($0.8 million at the date of payment) and issued an aggregate of 600,000 common shares to Ipsen under a share purchase agreement which was entered into concurrently with the Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement. We are also obligated to pay Ipsen up to an additional €67.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones; low single digit royalties on potential future net sales; and up to €350.0 million in net sales milestones, in each case, relating to products covered by the Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement. We are responsible for paying to a third-party licensor up to a total of €70.0 million in development milestones for up to three indications and mid to low double-digit royalties on potential future net sales of products covered by the license agreement.
 The Ipsen Asset Purchase Agreement includes a royalty step down whereby royalties owed to Ipsen will be reduced by certain percentages not to exceed 50%, in the aggregate, of the royalty owed under certain circumstances relating to loss of patent exclusivity, loss of regulatory exclusivity or generics entering a market. Under the asset purchase agreement Ipsen has agreed not to develop a molecule that targets NTSR1 and combines at least one NTSR1 binding moiety and a radionuclide or cytotoxic agent until the earlier of (i) the seventh anniversary of the closing date or (ii) the date of data base lock after completion of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for IPN-1087.


RadioMedix Option and Asset Purchase Agreement
 On November 14, 2022, we and RadioMedix entered into an option and asset purchase agreement, or the RadioMedix Agreement, pursuant to which RadioMedix granted to us the exclusive right, but not the obligation, or the RadioMedix Option, to acquire certain of RadioMedix’s assets related to its on-going Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating 225Ac-PSMA-I&T, or the TATCIST Study, a small molecule targeting prostate specific membrane antigens, expressed on prostate tumors. Such assets include, among other things, the investigational new drug application for the TATCIST Study, and all governmental authorizations and materials related thereto, all know-how, intellectual property and information of RadioMedix related to 225Ac PSMA, any third-party license held, or later acquired, by RadioMedix relating to 225Ac PSMA, and clinical and other data for the TATCIST Study, or collectively, the RadioMedix Assets. In exchange for the RadioMedix Option, we paid RadioMedix an option fee of $0.8 million upon the execution of the RadioMedix Agreement. The RadioMedix Option has an exercise fee of $1.5 million payable to RadioMedix, or the RadioMedix Exercise Fee. Pursuant to the terms of the RadioMedix Agreement, we needed to exercise the RadioMedix Option within a specified time period following the delivery by RadioMedix of specified data related to the TATCIST Study, or the RadioMedix Option Trigger, though we had the right to exercise the RadioMedix Option prior to achievement of the RadioMedix Option Trigger.
 On February 10, 2023, we notified RadioMedix of our decision to exercise the RadioMedix Option and paid the RadioMedix Exercise Fee. The acquisition closed on the same day, February 10, 2023, or the RadioMedix Closing. We now refer to the alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical being evaluated in the TATCIST Study as FPI-2265.
 Pursuant to the terms of the RadioMedix Agreement, we will be obligated to pay RadioMedix (i) up to an additional $10.5 million upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones, (ii) low single-digit royalties on potential future net sales, subject to specified reductions, and (iii) up to an additional $50.0 million in net sales milestones; in each case, relating to products covered by the RadioMedix Agreement. In addition, in the event RadioMedix or we are successful in obtaining certain intellectual property rights from a third party relating to 225Ac-PSMA-I&T, the amount of the clinical and regulatory milestone payments will be increased by up to an aggregate of $4.0 million and the royalty rates will increase but remain in the low- to mid-single digits.
 Pursuant to the RadioMedix Agreement, we are prohibited from terminating or deprioritizing the development of 225Ac-PSMA-I&T, subject to specified exceptions, including, but not limited to regulatory, safety, efficacy, market exclusivity and competition and patentability developments. If we terminate or deprioritize the development of 225Ac-PSMA-I&T, and do not sell, license or otherwise transfer our rights to a third-party within 12 months of such termination, we and RadioMedix are required to negotiate the return of 225Ac PSMA I&T and related assets to RadioMedix in return for specified reimbursement costs to us.
 The RadioMedix Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature. Among other things, RadioMedix has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to develop or research a molecule that targets PSMA for a certain period of time following the RadioMedix Closing.
 The RadioMedix Agreement also contains customary termination provisions, including termination (i) by mutual written agreement of the parties, (ii) by either party in the event that the applicable conditions for termination of the TATCIST Study set forth in the TATCIST Study protocol are met, and (iii) by either party upon a material breach of the RadioMedix Agreement by the other party.
 To date, Excel Diagnostics and Nuclear Oncology Center, or Excel, an affiliate of RadioMedix, has been the only clinical trial site dosing patients in the TATCIST Study. At the RadioMedix Closing, we and Excel entered into a clinical trial agreement, pursuant to which Excel shall remain a clinical trial site following the RadioMedix Closing. Additionally, at the RadioMedix Closing, we and RadioMedix entered into manufacturing agreements under which RadioMedix will supply FPI-2265 to us for use in clinical trials. RadioMedix will not be the sole manufacturer to supply FPI-2265 for use in clinical trials.
 Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as those developed from our Fast-Clear linker technology and any other product candidates we develop. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug and Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates and any future product candidates we develop must be approved by the FDA through either a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. An NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market a drug or biologic, respectively, for one or more specified indications. NDAs must contain data sufficient for the agency to determine the drug is safe and effective, and BLAs must contain data sufficient to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the biologic. The FDA review and approval process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators 15 days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The

manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is, among other things, safe and effective for its intended use. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The NDA or BLA may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA decides whether to accept an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) as well as other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a drug or biologic can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threating disease or condition compared to available therapies. For original NDAs and BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date.
A product candidate may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Under FDORA, a platform technology incorporated within or utilized by a drug or biological product is eligible for designation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform technology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a drug approved under an NDA or BLA; (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or licensed drug, or a sponsor that

has been granted a right of reference to data submitted in the application for such drug, demonstrates that the platform technology has the potential to be incorporated in, or utilized by, more than one drug without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and (3) data or information submitted by the applicable person indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood to bring significant efficiencies to the drug development or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a platform technology as a designated platform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the platform technology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may expedite the development and review of any subsequent original NDA or BLA for a drug that uses or incorporates the platform technology. Designated platform technology status does not ensure that a drug will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may revoke a designation if the FDA determines that a designated platform technology no longer meets the criteria for such designation.
 Fast track designation, priority review, breakthrough therapy and platform technology designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials as well as other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, product sampling and distribution, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other

things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Additionally, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing.
Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a

change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA remains subject to significant uncertainty.
U.S. Healthcare Reform and Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy regulations by federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions can apply to the manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that can affect a pharmaceutical company’s operations include:
•The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution; 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement, including providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label, material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick 


or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 •The federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and 
 •Analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. 
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to

resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business.
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and congressional challenges, as well as efforts by the former Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates and any future product candidates we develop, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and

the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
Canadian Review and Approval Process
In Canada, our product candidates and our research and development activities are primarily regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by Health Canada (including its Biologic and Radiopharmaceutical Drugs Directorate). Health Canada regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and import and export of pharmaceutical, including radiopharmaceutical and biologic, products. The drug approval process under Canadian laws requires licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, government review and approval of experimental results prior to giving approval to sell drug products including radiopharmaceutical and biologic drug products. Regulators also typically require that rigorous and specific standards such as GMP, GLP and GCP are followed in the manufacture, testing and clinical development, respectively, of any drug product. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in Canada, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. For further information, see “Risk Factors.”
The principal steps required for drug approval in Canada are as follows:
Preclinical Toxicology Studies
Non-clinical studies are conducted in vitro and in animals to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the drug candidate prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies and throughout development. Such studies are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and GLP.
Initiation of Human Testing
In Canada, the process of conducting clinical trials with a new drug cannot begin until we have submitted a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, and the required number of days has lapsed without objection from Health Canada. Biological drugs carry additional risks, as compared to traditional small molecule drugs, associated with complexity and variability in manufacturing that can contribute to increased lot-to-lot variation of the final product, and with the potential for adventitious agents. Therefore, the content requirements for the quality information for biological drugs to be used in clinical trials are different from those for standard small molecule pharmaceutical drugs (for example, the inclusion of information on manufacturing facilities is required for biological drugs). In addition, it is necessary to have more stringent controls on the release of biologic drug lots used in authorized clinical trials.

Similar regulations apply in Canada to a CTA as to an IND in the United States. If the CTA is deemed by Health Canada to be acceptable, a No Objection Letter, or NOL, would be issued. A Not Satisfactory Notice will be issued by Health Canada if significant deficiencies are identified or if timely responses to information requested have not been received. Once approved by the issuance of an NOL, two key factors influencing the rate of progression of clinical trials are the rate at which patients can be enrolled to participate in the research program and whether effective treatments are currently available for the disease that the drug is intended to treat. Patient enrollment is largely dependent upon the incidence and severity of the disease, the treatments available and the potential side effects of the drug to be tested and any restrictions for enrollment that may be imposed by regulatory agencies. For further information, see “Risk Factors.”
Clinical Trials
Similar regulations apply in Canada regarding clinical trials as in the United States. In Canada, Research Ethics Boards, or REBs, instead of IRBs, are used to review and approve clinical trial plans. Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, in most cases a physician, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, requirements, which include review and approval by REBs. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Human clinical trials for new drugs are typically conducted in three sequential phases, Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, as discussed above in the context of government regulation in the United States.
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into Canada are also subject to regulation by Health Canada relating to their labeling and distribution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to Health Canada and the applicable REBs, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, in Canada, Health Canada or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an REB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the REB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
New Drug Submission
Upon successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, in Canada the company sponsoring a new drug then assembles all the preclinical and clinical data and other testing relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, and submits it to Health Canada as part of a New Drug Submission, or NDS. The NDS is then reviewed by Health Canada for approval to market the drug.
As part of the approval process, Health Canada will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Health Canada will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP—a quality system regulating manufacturing—is satisfactory and the NDS contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. In addition, before approving an NDS, Health Canada will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
The testing and approval process for an NDS requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Biologic drugs differ from standard small molecule drugs in that applicants must include more detailed chemistry and manufacturing information. This is necessary to help ensure the purity and quality of the product, for example to help ensure that it is not contaminated by an undesired microorganism. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Health Canada may not grant approval of an NDS on a timely basis, or at all. In Canada, NDSs are subject to user fees and these fees are typically increased annually to reflect inflation.
Even if Health Canada approves a product candidate, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and

surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms.
Biologic products and radiopharmaceuticals that have a biologic drug substance in particular are monitored post-approval by being placed on a lot release schedule tailored to their potential risk, manufacturing, testing and inspection history to date. With higher risk biologics, each lot is tested before being released for sale in Canada. Moderate risk biologics are periodically tested at the discretion of Health Canada while manufacturers of low risk biologics usually only need to contact Health Canada regarding lots being sold or for providing certification of complete and satisfactory testing. Products are carefully scrutinized before they are placed in any level of the lot release process, and at any time the testing regime for a biologic may be altered.
Health Canada may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, notification, and regulatory authority review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or regulatory notification may be required.
Canadian Biosimilars
The terms “biosimilar biologic drug” and “biosimilar” are used by Health Canada to describe a biologic drug that enters the market subsequent to a version previously authorized in Canada and with demonstrated similarity to a reference biologic drug. Accordingly, a biosimilar, previously known in Canada as a subsequent entry biologic, or SEB, will in all instances be a subsequent entrant onto the Canadian market.
Based on Health Canada guidance documents, a biosimilar can rely in part on prior information regarding safety and efficacy that is deemed relevant due to the demonstration of similarity to the reference biologic drug and which influences the amount and type of original data required. Generic drugs are chemically derived products that are pharmaceutically equivalent to innovative drugs, whereas biosimilars are products of a biologic nature that are similar to innovative biologics. According to Health Canada, it is not currently possible to demonstrate that two biologic drugs are pharmaceutically equivalent, and therefore the regulatory approval process for generics and biosimilars is different: biosimilars are approved using the standard NDS pathway with some allowances made for reduced safety and efficacy information set out in guidance documents, while generic drugs are approved using an abbreviated new drug submission pathway set in guidance and law under the Food and Drug Regulations. In part because it continues to be set out only in guidance and not law, the specific requirements in order to receive biosimilar approval are subject to some uncertainty.
As discussed above, all biosimilars enter the market subsequent to a biologic drug product previously approved in Canada and to which the biosimilar is considered similar. As such, biosimilars are subject to existing laws and regulations outlined in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations, and related guidance documents.
Similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, Canada has the Patented Medicines (NOC) Regulations under the Patent Act which require a company that files a drug submission that references a patented product (for example, a biosimilar) to address any relevant patents listed on the Patent Register against the reference product, prior to being able to receive approval from Health Canada. The Canadian regime is similar to the United States regime, but a number of distinctions do exist.
Like the United States, Canada also has data protection, but again differences exist between the two jurisdictions. For example, Canada’s data protection applies to an “innovative drug,” which is defined as a drug that contains a medicinal ingredient not previously approved in a drug by the Minister and that is not a variation of a previously approved medicinal ingredient such as a salt, ester, enantiomer, solvate or polymorph. If a product is deemed to be an innovate drug, it is eligible for an eight-year period of data protection (with an additional six-month pediatric extension in some circumstances). In general, biologics can be considered innovative drugs but typically biosimilars are not.
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, or EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.

Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation.
The new Regulation overhauled the system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, it is directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each Member State is required), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of MAs.
•The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including products produced by biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions or viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s CHMP, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing MA. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States, referred to as the Concerned Member States, for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, 


SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. In addition, there are specific requirements for a radiopharmaceutical MA application as detailed in the EMA’s Guideline on Radiopharmaceuticals dated 26 November 2008.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with an existing centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the EMA and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain MA.
 European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon the grant of an MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an MA for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their MA, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, however, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an MA application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the European Commission grants orphan designation in respect of a product, after receiving the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following the grant of an MA. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission nor any of the competent authorities in the EU Members States can accept an application or grant an MA for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if: (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized orphan product consents to such revocation; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for an MA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
If authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
 •The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. 
 •Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is sometimes governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization as well as the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the GDPR. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection

regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EEA’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the UK GDPR. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently broadly aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the new Clinical Trials Regulation which became effective in the EU on January 31, 2022 and provides for a streamlined clinical trial application and assessment procedure covering multiple EU Member States has not been implemented into UK law, and a separate application will need to be submitted for clinical trial authorization in the UK. The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now it has come into effect is not yet known, but the MHRA opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation took place from January 17, 2022 until March 14, 2022, and the MHRA is currently analyzing feedback. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned above which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of MAs from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain MA.
 Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU, Canada and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, coverage determination is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D

beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time-consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for

any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
