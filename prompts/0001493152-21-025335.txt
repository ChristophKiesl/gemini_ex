Item 1. Business
Background
 
The lithium-ion battery manufacturing supply chain is organized into four industries that operate in series: battery feedstock providers, material refiners, cell manufacturers, and end-use product (electric vehicle, stationary storage, consumer electronics, etc.) manufacturers. While the scale of manufacturing of lithium-ion battery cells and of electric vehicles and other end-use products have grown substantially within the US in recent years, there has been little domestic growth in the battery feedstock and material refining portions of the manufacturing supply chain. This has led to an imbalance within the domestic US supply chain and has caused the majority of cell manufacturing and end-use product manufacturers to rely on foreign supplies of their raw and refined feedstock materials. The situation is so dire that in its “Mineral Commodity Summaries 2020” report, the US Geological Survey estimated that less than 1% of each of the critical and strategic battery metals (lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese) produced globally in 2020 were produced within the US.
 
American Battery Metals Corporation (“ABMC”) is a startup company in the lithium-ion battery industry that is working to increase the domestic US production of these four battery metals through its engagement in the exploration of new primary resources of battery metals, in the development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction of these battery metals from primary resources, and in the commercialization of an internally developed integrated process for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries for the recovery of battery metals. Through this three-pronged approach ABMC is working to both increase the domestic production of these battery metals, and also to ensure that as these materials reach their end of lives that the constituent elemental battery metals are returned to the manufacturing supply chain in a closed-loop fashion.
 
Battery Metals Exploration
 
The Company’s exploration efforts are currently focused on the sampling and characterization of lithium-bearing of brine and claystone sedimentary resources in the Western Nevada Basin (WNB) located in Nye County, Nevada. Through sampling and evaluation of its previous brine stone holdings over the past year, the Company currently holds 644 BLM unpatented placer mining claims on approximately 12,880 acres of land. The Company is performing bench scale characterization and extraction trials to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of extracting elemental lithium from these, and newly acquired, resources in order to produce battery grade lithium hydroxide, and other high value lithium products, for sale to the battery metals market. In September 2021, the Company entered into an exploration license agreement on 305 unpatented lode claims for prospective lithium claystone exploration in the city of Tonopah’s mining district area.
 
ABMC has been evaluating the expansion and collection of samples of exploration efforts to nickel, cobalt, and manganese rich resources throughout the US and Canada, however, has not yet entered into any formal agreements or contracts.
 
Battery Metals Extractions
 
In addition, ABMC has been working in collaboration with several lithium-rich resource owners within the Clayton Valley area of Central Nevada. These resources largely consist of lithium-rich claystone sedimentary deposits, and ABMC has been working with these resource owners in order to receive sample quantities of materials from various drilling locations. Through characterizations and experimentation, ABMC has found that the mechanisms by which lithium is held within these deposits is quite unique, and ABMC has been performing bench scale trials on an internally developed first-of-kind selective leaching process for the low-cost extraction of lithium from these claystone resources. This novel method of enabling a selective leaching of lithium from these claystone sedimentary resources has allowed for significantly lower consumption of acid, lower levels of contaminants in the generated leach liquor, and lower overall costs of production. After reviewing the performance of this novel process and confirming its uniqueness through discussions with third party industry analysts, ABMC is considering preparing and submitting an initial provisional patent application for this technology.

With the material generated during these selective extraction trials, ABMC has performed bench scale separations, purification, and concentration processes to produce a high purity aqueous lithium hydroxide solution followed by crystallization and filtration processes to produce a battery cathode grade lithium hydroxide powder product. ABMC is currently evaluating the composition and morphology of these product materials relative to the required material specifications from high energy density cathode manufacturers in order to determine the technical and economic feasibility of manufacturing lithium hydroxide monohydrate products through this set of technologies with Clayton Valley claystone sedimentary resources as the feedstock.
 
The remainder of the Company’s extraction efforts have been through using recycled materials as feedstock.
 
Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling
 
ABMC has developed a universal lithium-ion battery recycling system that is able to recycle batteries of a wide range of form factors (packs, modules, cylindrical cells, prismatic cells, pouch cells, defect and intermediate waste cells, metal scraps, slurries, and powders) and of a wide range of cathode chemistries (lithiated cobalt oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum oxide, lithiated nickel-oxide, and lithiated manganese-oxide) of various relative weighting of transition metals. While there currently has not been a large proliferation of lithium-ion battery recycling facilities in operation globally, the few that are operating generally implement “brute force” methods of processing batteries, by performing bulk high temperature calcinations or bulk acid dissolutions. These upfront processes can be simpler to implement; however, they also make it very difficult to enable high material recovery efficiencies of high value metal products downstream.
 
ABMC has developed a highly strategic recycling processing train that does not employ any high temperature operations or any bulk chemical treatments of the full battery. Several of the leaders of the ABMC team have previously worked in the design, construction, commissioning, and optimization of one of the largest lithium-ion battery manufacturing factories in the world. Through these experiences they gained a first principles physics-based understanding of every stage of lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing, and more importantly a fundamental understanding of the failure mechanisms that can cause battery components, cells, and modules to fail. Through these fundamental understandings the ABMC team has developed an automated high-speed mechanical separation process, which works to exploit the weaknesses in battery design to essentially “de-manufacture” the modules and cells in a rapid and automated fashion in order to dissect and separate the constituent components. This system is able to feed battery materials, without bulk discharging operations, and separate module materials, cell casings, electrode foils, low density materials, material powders, and wastewater in a matter of minutes without any direct hands-on operator interactions.
 
After the battery feedstock material is separated and sorted, what remains is a stream that contains rinse water, organic carbonates, dissolved fluorine and phosphorous species, dissolved metals, and is of very high pH due to the leaching of loosely held lithium from the electrodes. While many current facilities lightly treat this water stream in order to meet discharge requirements, the ABMC team has instead developed a 6-part system that is able to treat this water in a targeted fashion, extract contaminants in non-hazardous forms, and purify the water to a higher quality than even the onsite well water. This treated water is then re-used back in the separations process in a closed loop fashion. The avoidance of the discharge of this water, and of the purchasing of makeup water, results in significant levelized cost savings and a dramatically lowered environmental footprint.
 
While the scrap metal products are sold directly after being separated from the automated disassembly system, the cathode and anode powders are sent for further processing in an internally developed chemical extraction system. This consists of a series of dilute acid dissolution, impurity removal, selective extraction, and purification systems that are able to individually extract lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese elemental metals and upgrade them to the battery cathode grade specifications demanded by high energy density cathode manufacturers.
 
Through the high speed and automated de-manufacturing of a wide variety of battery feedstock materials, and the low cost and high material recovery efficiency chemical extraction train, ABMC is able to successfully extract battery metals from end-of-life products and manufacturing waste and return them to the lithium-ion battery manufacturing supply chain in an economically sustainable fashion. As a result of their lower environmental footprint, lower total cost of production, and high stability of supply these recycled battery cathode metal feedstocks are highly valuable and sought after by domestic US high energy density cathode manufacturers.

The largest high energy density cathode manufacturing within the US is BASF, and in order to accelerate the commercialization of closed loop lithium-ion battery recycling, they initiated the Circularity Challenge in early 2019. This was a global competition where they challenged companies throughout the world to develop new innovative technologies for the recycling of large format lithium-ion batteries to establish a circular economy in the battery supply chain industries. To winners of the Circularity Challenge, BASF offered seed funding, access to development laboratories, and the exploration of partnership agreements. Over 100 companies throughout the world applied to this challenge throughout 2019, and after several down select and review presentations, in September 2019 BASF selected ABMC as the sole winner of the battery recycling portion of this Circularity Challenge. BASF is one of the largest purchasers of lithium-ion battery metal feedstocks in the US, and through the relationship established through this Circularity Challenge ABMC and BASF have been exploring several avenues of working together to accelerate the commercialization of this lithium-ion battery recycling technology.
 
The Company is working with its design-build general contractor and architectural firm on the design and construction of an initial plant and storage facilities for its battery recycling business (the “Pilot Plant”) (See further discussion in Properties below). When completed, the Pilot Plant is expected to consist of approximately 100,000 square feet of building space, including a 60,000 square foot production space, space for a development center with laboratories and offices, and a warehouse. The Pilot Plant production space will be built in two phases, 30,000 square feet at first, then another 30,000 square feet in the second phase.
 
Recent Financing Transaction
 
On September 27, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with a U.S.-based institutional asset manager for the sale of ABMC common shares yielding approximately $36,925,000 of net proceeds, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The net proceeds from the transaction are expected to fully fund the Company through the construction and commissioning of its Nevada-based 20,000 metric tonne per year battery recycling pilot plant as well as provide working capital to the Company over the next twelve months. For details of this financing transaction, please refer to the current report on form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2021.
Company History
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2011 for the purpose of acquiring rights to mineral properties with the eventual objective of being a producing mineral company. We have limited operating history and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our activities. Our principal executive offices are located at 401 S Ryland Street, Suite 138, Reno, NV 89502.
 
On August 8, 2016, the Company formed Lithortech Resources Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to serve as its operating subsidiary for lithium resource exploration and development. On June 29, 2018, the Company changed the name of Lithortech Resources to LithiumOre Corp. (“LithiumOre”). On May 3, 2019, the Company changed its name to American Battery Metals Corporation. On August 12, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada to change its name to American Battery Technology Company which name better aligns with the Company’s current business activities.
 
The growth in demand for lithium-ion batteries is predicted by industry researchers to grow by over ten-fold over the next ten years, while over the same period there are limited announcements for new production sources of domestic US based lithium, nickel, cobalt, or manganese. As a result, there will be increased pressure on the prices of domestically sourced battery metals, and increased reliance on foreign sourced battery metals. These industry trends support and validate the Company’s multifaceted three-pronged business model to increase the production of domestic US sourced battery metals. The Company is currently a pre-revenue organization and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have initial operations of our lithium-ion battery recycling facility underway, or until we have undertaken sufficient exploration work to identify lithium and or other battery metals reserves and have validated and commercialized a cost-effective extraction system.
 
Market and Industry
 
Lithium is extracted from primarily two sources: hard rock spodumene and pegmatite crystals, and dissolved lithium salts from brine pools. Currently, the world’s top producers of Lithium are located in Australia, Chile, Argentina, and China.
 
Excluding the US, 2020, worldwide Lithium production totaled approximately 82,000 tons, with the top 4 countries (Australia, Chile, China, Argentina) contributing roughly 95% of the global production. Most of the world’s lithium supply is produced by five companies: Albemarle Corporation, FMC Corporation/Livent, Chile’s Sociedad Quimica Y Minera de Chile (SQM), Ganfeng Lithium, and Tianqi Lithium. Albemarle, FMC, and SQM have traditionally been considered the “Big 3” of global lithium producers. FMC Corporation spun off its lithium production to Livent in 2018.

In 2020, the market share of the “Big 3” companies decreased from 85% to 53%, with the Chinese companies attaining 40% market share.
 
Much of the current production of Lithium in Australia is derived from conventional mining techniques of ancient Precambrian rocks containing Lithium ore which is crushed and fed into capital intensive processing plants which upgrade the lithium mineral using gravity, flotation, magnetic and roasting purification processes.
 
Alternatively, Lithium production from Chile and Argentina uses a much less capital intense extraction method. Lithium is located beneath various salt flats. The Lithium is leached from nearby source rocks and becomes concentrated in salty brines just under the surface. The Lithium enriched brines are then pumped up to settle in multiple shallow surface evaporation pools which produces a thicker Lithium rich liquid. That liquid is treated with sodium carbonate, which creates lithium carbonate.
 
The Lithium market has typically been dominated by the ceramic and medical sectors, however recently the demand for Lithium for the battery markets- to fuel electric vehicles and energy storage applications- outstripped any other sector.
 
The primary lithium-ion battery manufacturers by capacity are: CATL, BYD, Tesla, Panasonic of Japan, and LG Chem of South Korea.
 
Lithium is not currently traded on any commodity exchanges, but rather is usually distributed in a chemical form such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and sold directly to end users for a negotiated price per ton of lithium carbonate.
 
General Market Analysis
 
Lithium-ion batteries have become the rechargeable battery of choice in cell phones, computers, electric cars and now larger scale electric storage. The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted to far outpace lithium production in the coming decade; in particular, Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry is expected to continue to drive demand beyond supply.
 
Recently, Japan and South Korea have both recorded high levels of Lithium-ion battery exports as auto companies’ ramp up battery consumption to power all-electric vehicle sales. China has the most electric vehicles on the road, but both European and North American auto manufacturers are committed to significantly increasing EV sales by 2025. According to Goldman Sachs, 25% of cars sold will have electric engines by 2025, up from 5% today. Just a 1% increase of Electric Vehicles hitting the market could increase lithium demand by roughly half of the current production of lithium today.
 
Tesla’s mile long Gigafactory started producing powerful Lithium-ion batteries in January 2017 with its partner Panasonic. The Gigafactory will supply batteries for the 500,000 cars Tesla hopes to produce by the end of the decade, as well as to power homes. Also, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saturn, Tesla and Toyota have all announced plans to build lithium-ion battery powered cars. After Tesla released the Model 3 in July 2017, there have been over 500,000 reservations for the vehicle and production is starting 2 years ahead of schedule. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla will have to acquire the entire lithium market to meet the current demands. Thus, the global lithium market is approaching shortages, which has made it a useful commodity and mineral explorers have launched efforts to locate and bring new suppliers to the marketplace.
 
Lithium brine exploration and development has proven to be much more cost effective and faster to be put into production than the hard rock mine counterparts. Lithium brine deposits are considered placer deposits and are easier to gain mining permits for. Brine is also a liquid which means that drilling to find it is more akin to drilling for water or oil. It’s also typically located relatively close to surface, which limits the depth of required drilling. Once lithium brine is found, the reserve data is more straightforward to understand and quantify.
 
As the brines are found in large flat areas, the construction of numerous flat evaporation pools or direct solvent extraction can be achieved at relatively low cost. Environmental impact is minimized as the excess residual brines can be pumped back into the salt flats. In addition, the Company is now exploring prospective near-surface claystone deposits.

In Summary:
 
Historically, lithium demand came from industrial sectors manufacturing greases, glass, and ceramics. The processing of lithium for industrial applications requires lower specification products.
 
The introduction of the lithium-ion battery for consumer electronics, EV, and energy storage applications changed the demand dynamic; the batteries for e-mobility and energy storage now dominate current and future demand for lithium. Electric vehicles will continue to require vast amounts of lithium with higher grade and purities.
 
Electric Vehicle OEM are increasingly quality-conscious and develop close relationships to the modern “megafactories” that supply them with battery cells. In order to consistently supply the desired high nickel cathodes, megafactories need high purity raw materials - particularly lithium - to create low impurity lithium hydroxide.
 
In the United States, there are not currently enough chemical producers in operation to meet existing or future standards; battery grade hydroxide production is quite small as compared to the whole lithium supply chain. To meet market demand, this segment must quickly grow in the short term, at an estimated rate of 35-40% between now and 2025.
 
In 2019, explanations for the drop in the price of lithium were erroneously attributed to the “oversupply myth.” The reality is that there is not “too much lithium” in production but rather that there is not enough battery grade lithium hydroxide to meet market demand to fuel the explosive projections for Electric Vehicles.
 
Existing producers know that aside from handling and limited shelf life, consistently producing battery grade hydroxide within “spec,” while meeting the qualification challenges going forward will require significantly more high-grade lithium products. This will require new resources of raw materials, which demands investment in new exploration and mining projects.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mining/exploration and battery recycling companies, many of which possess greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do, in connection with the acquisition of suitable exploration properties, building and operating process plants and in connection with the engagement of qualified personnel. The lithium exploration/mining and battery recycling industries are fragmented, and we are a very small participant in these sectors. Many of our competitors have been in business longer than we have and have established more strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial accessibility than we have.
 
While we compete with other exploration companies in acquiring suitable properties, we believe that there would be readily available purchasers of lithium and other precious metals if they were to be produced from any of our leased properties. The price of precious metals can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including:
 
● fluctuations in the market prices for lithium;
 
● fluctuating supplies of lithium;
 
● fluctuating demand for lithium; and
 
● mining activities of others.
 
If lithium mineralization that is determined to be of economic grade and in sufficient quantity to justify production were located, additional capital would be required to develop, mine and sell our production.
 
Covid-19 Impact
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the world, the ongoing global pandemic continues to prompt governments and businesses to maintain and, in some cases, extend unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included federal, state, county and local governments, and public health organizations and authorities around the world implementing a variety of measures intended to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders, travel restrictions, school closures, business limitations and closures, social distancing and hygiene requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. A prolonged economic downturn and adverse impact to global economies or a sustained slowdown in growth or demand could have an adverse effect on commodity prices and/or our ability to raise financing to meet our ongoing obligations. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions required to contain or treat its impact, among others.
