ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” or “us” or like terms, when referring to periods prior to September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Gathering LLC (“CNX Gathering”) our predecessor for accounting purposes. References to “CNXM,” the “Partnership,” “we,” “our,” “us” or similar expressions, when referring to periods since September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Midstream Partners LP, including its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
CNX Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNXM) is a growth-oriented master limited partnership focused on the ownership, operation, development and acquisition of midstream energy infrastructure in the Appalachian Basin. We currently provide midstream services to our customers’ production in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia under long-term, fixed-fee contracts. Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. We are managed by our general partner, CNX Midstream GP LLC (our “general partner”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNX Gathering. CNX Gathering is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) (“CNX Resources”). 
We were formed in May 2014 as a joint venture between CNX Resources and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) (“Noble Energy”). On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas Company LLC (“CNX Gas”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CNX Resources, acquired from NBL Midstream, LLC (“NBL Midstream”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy, NBL Midstream’s 50% interest in CNX Gathering. CNX Resources became our sole sponsor as a result of this transaction, and we refer to CNX Resources as our “Sponsor” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Developments and Highlights—CNX Resources Acquisition of General Partner” for more information related to CNX Gas’ acquisition of NBL Midstream’s indirect interest in our general partner. 
We generate substantially all of our revenues under long-term, fixed-fee gathering agreements with each of CNX Resources and HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (“HG Energy”) that are intended to mitigate our direct commodity price exposure and enhance the stability of our cash flows. The gathering agreements currently include acreage dedications of approximately 363,000 aggregate net acres, comprised of approximately 262,000 Marcellus acres and approximately 101,000 Utica acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Although CNX Resources and HG Energy currently account for substantially all of our revenues, we intend to supplement our profitability and future growth by pursuing opportunities to perform gathering services for other unrelated third parties in the future. In addition, we also consider accretive acquisitions, which may include drop downs of additional interests in our existing consolidated assets.
Since our IPO in September 2014, a substantial number of wells have been turned in line in our dedication area, which contributed to our largest gross average combined throughput level of approximately 1,821 BBtu/d for the year ended December 31, 2019 (1,606 BBtu/d excluding third-party volumes under short-haul agreements). See “Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer” for a more detailed explanation. 
The following charts illustrate our throughput trends and well turn-in-line activity on our dedicated acreage for the periods indicated: 

(1) Represents average daily combined throughput for the periods presented, excluding third-party volumes under high-pressure short-haul agreements.
 (2) Represents total gross wells turned in line on our dedicated acreage in the periods presented.
Developments and Highlights
Incentive Distribution Rights Elimination Transaction 
On January 29, 2020, CNX and CNXM entered into and closed definitive agreements to eliminate CNXM’s incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) held by its general partner and to convert the 2.0% general partner interest in CNXM into a non-economic general partnership interest (collectively, the "IDR Elimination Transaction").  
Pursuant to the IDR Elimination Transaction agreements, CNX will receive the following consideration in exchange for the IDRs and the 2% general partner interest:

• | 26 million CNXM common units;


• | 3 million new CNXM Class B units. The newly issued Class B units will not receive or accrue distributions until January 1, 2022, at which time they will automatically convert into CNXM common units on a one-for-one basis; and


• | $135.0 million, to be paid in three installments of $50.0 million due December 31, 2020, $50.0 million due December 31, 2021 and $35.0 million due December 31, 2022.

As a result of the IDR Elimination Transaction, CNX now owns 47.7 million common units, or approximately 53.1%, of the outstanding limited partner interests in CNXM, excluding the Class B units. Upon conversion of the Class B units to CNXM common units on January 1, 2022, CNX's ownership will increase to 50.7 million units on a proforma basis. 
CNX Resources Acquisition of General Partner
On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas acquired NBL Midstream’s 50% membership interest in CNX Gathering for cash consideration of $305.0 million and the mutual release of all outstanding claims between the parties (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, CNX Gas entered into new 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement with the Partnership. See “Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy” for more information related to our new gathering agreement with CNX Gas. 
Transactions with our Sponsor and HG Energy 
On May 3, 2018, we announced a strategic transaction with our Sponsor, pursuant to which we amended our gas gathering agreement (“GGA”) with CNX Gas to provide for the following (collectively, the “CNX Transactions”):

• | Dedication to the Partnership of approximately 16,100 additional Utica acres in our Anchor Systems (as defined below);


• | Commitment to develop 40 additional wells in the Anchor Systems by 2023, subject to the terms of the GGA;


• | Contribution to the Anchor Systems of a 20” high pressure pipeline in addition to a one-time payment to us of approximately $2.0 million in cash; and


• | Distribution of our 5% interest in the Growth Systems (as defined below) and related assets, as well as our 5% interest in the Moundsville midstream assets that were a part of the Additional Systems (as defined below), to CNX Gathering, which subsequently transferred the assets to HG Energy.

On May 3, 2018, we also announced a strategic transaction with HG Energy, pursuant to which we amended our GGA with HG Energy to provide for the following (collectively, the “HG Energy Transaction”):

• | Release from dedication of approximately 18,000 acres, net to the Partnership, which was comprised of approximately 275,000 acres (or approximately 14,000 acres, net to the Partnership) within the Growth and Additional Systems and approximately 4,200 scattered acres located in the Anchor Systems;


• | Removal of our obligation to provide gathering services or make capital investments in the Growth Systems or in the Moundsville area of the Additional Systems; and


• | Commitment by HG Energy to develop 12 additional wells in the Anchor Systems by 2021, subject to the terms of the HG Energy GGA.

Following the CNX and HG Energy Transactions, the aggregate number of well commitments in the Anchor Systems to the Partnership increased from 140 to 192 wells over the course of the next five years. As of May 3, 2018, the Partnership has no remaining interests in the Growth Systems or the Moundsville area assets that were historically included within the Additional Systems.
Acquisition of Shirley-Penns System
Prior to March 16, 2018, CNX Gathering owned a 95% noncontrolling interest, while the Partnership owned the remaining 5% controlling interest, in the Additional Systems, which owned the gathering system and related assets commonly referred to as the Shirley-Penns System (the “Shirley-Penns System”). On March 16, 2018, the Partnership acquired the 
remaining 95% interest in the Shirley-Penns System, pursuant to which the Additional Systems transferred its interest in the Shirley-Penns System on a pro rata basis to CNX Gathering and the Partnership in accordance with each transferee’s respective ownership interest in the Additional Systems. Following such transfer, CNX Gathering sold its aggregate interest in the Shirley-Penns System, which now resides in the Anchor Systems, in exchange for cash consideration in the amount of $265.0 million (the “Shirley-Penns Acquisition”). The Partnership funded the Shirley-Penns Acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 6.5% senior notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”). 
Organizational Structure as of January 29, 2020

Our Midstream Assets
Our midstream assets consist of two operating segments that we refer to as our “Anchor Systems” and “Additional Systems” based on their relative current cash flows, growth profiles, capital expenditure requirements and the timing of their development. 

• | Our Anchor Systems, in which the Partnership owns a 100% controlling interest, include our most developed midstream systems that generate the largest portion of our current cash flows, including our five primary midstream systems (the McQuay, Majorsville, Dry Ridge, Mamont and Shirley-Penns Systems), a 20” high-pressure pipeline contributed to us in the CNX Transaction and related assets.


• | Our Additional Systems, in which the Partnership owns a 5% controlling interest, include several gathering systems throughout our dedicated acreage. Revenues from our Additional Systems are currently derived primarily from the Pittsburgh Airport area, which is within the wet gas region of our dedicated acreage. Currently, the substantial majority of capital investment in these systems would be funded directly by CNX Gathering in proportion to CNX Gathering’s 95% retained ownership interest.

As a result of the CNX Transaction and HG Energy Transaction described in Business—Developments and Highlights above, the Partnership distributed its ownership interests in (i) our “Growth Systems,” which were primarily located in the dry gas regions of our dedicated acreage in central West Virginia, and (ii) the Moundsville area assets formerly within the Additional Systems, to CNX Gathering. CNX Gathering subsequently transferred these assets to HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (“HG Energy”).
In order to maintain operational flexibility, our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our operating subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our operating subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring employees or by obtaining the services of others, which include personnel of CNX Resources as provided through contractual relationships with the Partnership. All of the personnel who conduct our business are employed or contracted by our general partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, but we sometimes refer to these individuals as our employees because they provide services directly to us.
The following map details our existing assets:
Gathering Assets and Compression and Dehydration Facilities
As of December 31, 2019, we operated 18 facilities to provide our compression and/or dehydration services. The following table provides information regarding our gathering assets and compression and dehydration facilities as of December 31, 2019:

System | Pipelines (in miles) | Average Daily Throughput (BBtu/d) | Maximum Interconnect Capacity(1) (BBtu/d) | Compression (horsepower) | Compression Capacity (BBtu/d)
Anchor Systems | 253 | 1,739 | 2,467 | 120,600 | 2,565 
Additional Systems | 26 | 82 | 416 | — | — 
Total | 279 | 1,821 | 2,883 | 120,600 | 2,565 

(1) Maximum interconnect capacity is the maximum throughput that can be delivered from the system through physical interconnections to third-party facilities or pipelines. Our midstream systems currently have interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and Dominion Transmission, Inc.
Condensate Handling Facilities
Our assets include condensate handling facilities in the Majorsville and Shirley facilities located in West Virginia. Each facility provides condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization services and has a nominal handling capacity of approximately 2,500 Bbl/d. 
Our Relationship with CNX Resources and CNX Gathering 
CNX Resources, which owns a 100% interest in CNX Gathering, is a premiere independent natural gas exploration and production company, focusing on the major shale formations of the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. CNX Resources deploys an organic growth strategy focused on developing its resource base. 
CNX Gathering owns a non-economic general partnership interest (See Note 25 - Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information) as well as a 95% noncontrolling limited partner interest in our Additional Systems, which, combined with our right of first offer on those interests, may provide opportunities for us to grow our Distributable Cash Flow through a series of acquisitions of these retained interests over time. However, CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets, including our right of first offer (“ROFO”) assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets, and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. 
The Partnership owns a 100% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems and a 5% controlling interest in the Additional Systems. Through our ownership of all of the outstanding general partner interests in our operating subsidiaries, the Partnership has voting control over, and the exclusive right to manage, the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of our midstream systems. 
Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer 
As of December 31, 2019, our existing dedicated acreage covered approximately 363,000 aggregate net acres, comprised of approximately 262,000 Marcellus acres and approximately 101,000 Utica acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Our gathering agreement with CNX Gas provides that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas in an area that covers over 4,100 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “dedication area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment, will automatically be dedicated to us for natural gas midstream services, subject to the release provisions set forth in each agreement. 
Our gathering agreement with CNX Gas also grants us ROFO rights to provide midstream services on certain of CNX Gas’ acreage, which we call the ROFO acreage. The ROFO acreage includes approximately 194,000 aggregate net acres that are not currently dedicated to us. Our ROFO acreage also includes any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas in an area that covers over 11,800 square miles in Pennsylvania, that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment, which we refer to as the “ROFO area”. There are no restrictions under our gathering agreements (discussed below) on the ability of CNX Gas to transfer acreage in the ROFO area, and any such transfer of acreage in the ROFO area will not be subject to our ROFO.  
CNX Gathering has granted us a ROFO under the omnibus agreement between us, our general partner and CNX Resources to acquire (i) CNX Gathering’s retained interests in our Additional Systems, (ii) CNX Gathering’s other ancillary midstream assets and (iii) any additional midstream assets that CNX Gathering develops during the ten-year period ending 2024 (the “right of first offer period”). CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. 
In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. While we believe our ROFO are significant positive attributes, they may also be sources of conflicts of interest. CNX Gathering owns our general partner, and there is substantial overlap between the officers and directors of our general partner and the officers and directors of CNX Resources. Please read “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—CNXM does not have any officers or employees and rely on officers of our general partner and employees of our Sponsor.”
Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy
Fees, Well Commitments and Minimum Volume Commitments 
We entered into a Second Amended and Restated GGA with CNX Gas in January 2018, which is a 20-year, fixed-fee gathering agreement. Although the fees for services we provide in the Marcellus Shale for existing wells remain unchanged in the new agreement, and are identical to the fees we charge to HG Energy (discussed below), the Second Amended and Restated GGA also dedicated additional acreage in the Utica Shale in and around the McQuay area and Wadestown area and introduced the following gas gathering and compression rates (rates shown effective January 1, 2020):
•Gas Gathering:

◦ | McQuay area Utica - a fee of $0.2368 per MMBtu; and


◦ | Wadestown Marcellus and Utica - a fee of $0.3678 per MMBtu.


• | Compression:


◦ | For areas not benefitting from system expansion pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated GGA, compression services are included in the base fees; and


◦ | In the McQuay and Wadestown areas, we will receive additional fees of $0.0683 per MMBtu for Tier 1 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 600 psi) and $0.1366 per MMBtu for Tier 2 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 300 psi).

The Second Amended and Restated GGA also commits CNX Gas to drill and complete the following number of wells in the McQuay area within the Anchor Systems for the periods indicated, provided that if a certain minimum number of wells have been drilled and completed in the Marcellus Shale, then the remainder of such planned wells must be drilled in the Utica Shale. To the extent the requisite number of wells are not drilled by CNX Gas in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set out in the parenthetical below:

• | January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 - 30 wells (CNX exceeded this requirement by eight wells)


• | January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $3.5 million per well)


• | May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)


• | May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022 - 30 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)

In the event that CNX Gas drills and completes a number of wells in excess of the number required to be drilled and completed in such period, (i) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during such period will be applied to the minimum well requirement in the succeeding period or (ii) to the extent CNX Gas was required to make deficiency payments for shortfalls in the preceding period, CNX Gas may elect to cause the Partnership to pay a refund in an amount equal to (x) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during the period, multiplied by (y) the deficiency payment paid per well during the period in which the shortfall occurred. CNX Gas satisfied its minimum well obligation for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In connection with the Shirley-Penns Acquisition, the Second Amended and Restated GGA was amended to add a minimum volume commitment (“MVC”) on volumes associated with the Shirley-Penns System through December 31, 2031. The MVC commits CNX Gas to pay the Partnership the wet gas fee under the GGA for all natural gas we gather up to a specified amount per day through December 31, 2031. We will recognize minimum revenue on volumes throughout the term of the GGA, as set forth below:

(in millions) | Minimum Revenue
Year ending December 31, 2020 | $ | 17.5 
Year ending December 31, 2021 | 40.7 | 
Year ending December 31, 2022 | 47.7 | 
Year ending December 31, 2023 | 42.8 | 
Year ending December 31, 2024 | 39.6 | 
Remainder of term | 174.0 | 
Total revenue to be recognized under Shirley-Penns contract through December 31, 2031 | $ | 362.3

See “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Related Party Transactions” for additional information. 
We entered into a Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated GGA in May 2018, which committed CNX Gas to drill and complete an additional 40 wells in the Majorsville/Mamont area within the Anchor Systems by the end of 2023. To the extent the requisite number of wells are not drilled and completed by CNX Gas in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set forth below:

• | July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 - an additional 15 wells (As of December 31, 2019, CNX Gas has exceeded this minimum well commitment by six wells)


• | January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023 - an additional 25 wells (deficiency payment of $2.8 million per well)

On December 1, 2016, we entered into fixed-fee gathering agreements with CNX Gas and Noble Energy that replaced the gathering agreements that had been in place since our initial public offering (“IPO”). Our gathering agreement with Noble Energy was assigned to HG Energy effective June 28, 2017 and was further amended in connection with the HG Energy Transaction. The fixed fee terms for our gathering of HG Energy’s dry gas, wet gas, and condensate remain unchanged following the June 2017 assignment and May 2018 amendment; however, other terms have changed related to our obligations to build infrastructure, the amount of acreage that is dedicated to us and can be released, service and system requirements, and minimum well development provisions. Please read “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our gathering agreements with our customers provide for the release of dedicated acreage or fee credits in certain situations.” for additional details.
We entered into a Second Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated GGA in May 2018, which committed HG Energy to drill and complete an additional 12 wells in the Majorsville area within the Anchor Systems by the end of 2021. To the extent the requisite number of wells are not drilled and completed by HG Energy in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set forth below:

• | May 2, 2018 to December 31, 2018 - an additional 3 wells (HG Energy has met this requirement)


• | January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 - an additional 9 wells (deficiency payment of $2.8 million per well)

Under the gathering agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy, effective January 1, 2019, we will receive a fee based on the type and scope of the midstream services we provide, summarized as follows (rates shown effective January 1, 2020):

• | With respect to natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation that does not require downstream processing, or dry gas, we receive a fee of $0.4531 per MMBtu.


• | With respect to natural gas that requires downstream processing, or wet gas, we receive a fee of $0.3116 per MMBtu in the Pittsburgh International Airport area and a fee of $0.6222 per MMBtu for all other areas in the dedication area.


• | Our fees for condensate services are $5.6580 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and the Shirley-Penns area.

Each of the foregoing fees paid by CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, escalates by 2.5% annually, through and including the final calendar year of the initial term. With respect to our GGA with CNX Gas, commencing on January 1, 2035, and on each January 1 thereafter, each of the applicable fees will be adjusted pursuant to the percentage change in CPI-U, but such fees will never escalate or decrease by more than 3%. 
There are no restrictions under our gathering agreements with CNX Gas on the ability of CNX Gas to transfer acreage in the right of first offer (“ROFO”) area, and any such transfer of acreage in the ROFO area will not be subject to our right of first offer. 
Upon completion of their initial 20-year terms, each of our gathering agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy will continue in effect from year to year until such time as the agreement is terminated by either us or the other party to such agreement on or before 180 days prior written notice.
Other Gathering Agreement Matters 
We gather, compress, dehydrate and deliver dedicated natural gas for CNX Gas and HG Energy on a first-priority basis in the Marcellus Shale, gather, inject, stabilize and/or store all of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis in the Majorsville area and gather, inject, stabilize and/or store all of CNX Gas’ dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis in the Shirley-Penns and Pittsburgh International Airport areas, subject to certain exceptions described in our respective gathering agreements.
Pursuant to the terms of our GGA’s, we are entitled to receive ongoing updates from our two largest customers regarding their drilling and development operations, which include detailed descriptions of drilling plans, production details and well locations for periods that range from 24 to 48 months, as well as more general development plans that may extend as far as ten years. In addition, we regularly meet with our customers to discuss our current plans to construct the facilities necessary to provide midstream services to each of them on our dedicated acreage. In the event that we do not perform our obligations under a gathering agreement, CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, will be entitled to certain rights and procedural remedies thereunder, including rate credits, the temporary and/or permanent release from dedication discussed below and indemnification from us. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk 
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our gathering agreements with our customers provide for the release of dedicated acreage or fee credits in certain situations.” for additional details.
Third-Party Services and Commitments 
Our GGAs, in certain instances, limit the scope of services we provide, which impacts the fees we charge. Under such agreements, we may provide only gathering services, while other parties may provide other services such as compression and/or dehydration. 
The most significant of these agreements is with CNX Gas and relates to the Pittsburgh International Airport area, where we only provide gathering services. With respect to this area, CNX Gas has contracted with a third party for the provision of services, such as compression and dehydration, which we are not providing. Accordingly, we charge CNX Gas a reduced fee for the services we provide with respect to all natural gas and condensate produced from the Pittsburgh International Airport area. While such arrangements have historically been the exception, we do have similar arrangements with other shippers.
Title to Our Properties
Our real property interests are acquired pursuant to easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, deeds or licenses from landowners, lessors, easement holders, governmental authorities, or other parties controlling surface estate (collectively, “surface agreements”). These surface agreements allow us to use such land for our operations. Thus, the real estate interests on which our pipelines and facilities are located are held by us as grantee, and the party who owns or controls the surface lands, as grantor. We have acquired these surface agreements without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory rights and interests to conduct our operations on such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying title of any material surface agreements held by us or to our title to any material surface agreements, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material surface agreements.
Some of the surface agreements that were transferred to us from CNX Gathering required the consent of the grantor or other holder of such rights. CNX Gathering obtained sufficient third-party consents and authorizations and provided notices required for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, authorizations or notices that have not been obtained or provided, we have determined these will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business should the Partnership or CNX Gathering fail to obtain or provide such consents, authorizations or notices in a reasonable time frame.
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand for natural gas during the summer and winter months and decrease demand for natural gas during the spring and fall months. With respect to our completed midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or complete construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe winter weather may also impact or delay the execution of our customers’ drilling and development plans.
Competition
As a result of our acreage dedications from CNX Gas and HG Energy, we do not compete for the portion of the existing operations of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s upstream operations for which we currently provide midstream services, and other than with respect to acreage that may be released, subject to the terms of our GGAs, we will not compete for future portions of their upstream operations that are dedicated to us pursuant to our gathering agreements. Please read “Business—Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer” above. Nonetheless, CNX Gas and HG Energy have entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain midstream services. Please read “Business—Third-Party Services and Commitments” above. In addition, we face competition in attracting third-party volumes to our midstream systems, and these third parties may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of employing our assets.
Regulation of Operations 
Our gathering and midstream operations are subject to various federal, state and local (including county and municipal level) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover virtually every aspect of our operations including, among other things: use of public roads; pipeline construction and the compression and transmission of natural gas and liquids; reclamation and restoration of properties after operations are completed; handling, storage, transportation and disposal of materials used or generated by our operations; and gathering of natural gas production. Numerous governmental permits, authorizations and approvals under these laws and regulations are required for midstream operations. These laws and regulations, and the permits, authorizations and 
approvals issued pursuant thereto, are intended to protect, among other things: air quality; ground water and surface water resources, including drinking water supplies; wetlands; waterways; endangered plants and wildlife; state natural resources and the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. 
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements against a backdrop of variable geologic and seasonal conditions, permit exceedances and violations during operations can and do occur. Such exceedances and violations generally result in fines or penalties but could make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary permits in the future. The possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our operations and may require us to change our operations significantly or incur substantial costs. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Existing and future governmental laws, regulations and judicial decisions that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business, restrict our operations or impede our ability to satisfy our obligations under our gas gathering agreements.” for additional discussion regarding additional laws and regulations affecting our business, operations and industry.
Regulation of the Gathering and Transportation of Natural Gas
Regulations and orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) impact our business to a certain degree. Although the FERC does not directly regulate our gathering and midstream activities, the FERC has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry. Additionally, the FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and regulates the terms, conditions of service, and rates for the interstate transportation of natural gas. The FERC possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas markets, including anti-market manipulation regulation. The FERC has the ability to assess civil penalties, order disgorgement of profits and recommend criminal penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “Natural Gas Act”) or the FERC’s regulations and policies thereunder.
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC. However, the distinction between federally unregulated gathering facilities and FERC-regulated transmission facilities is a fact-based determination, and the classification of such facilities may be the subject of dispute and, potentially, litigation. We own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the FERC has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not subject to the FERC jurisdiction. However, FERC determines whether facilities are gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of some our gas gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to determine that our facilities or services provided by us are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and/or the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”), which could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. States in which we operate may adopt ratable take and common purchaser statutes, which would require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another similarly situated source of supply. The regulations under these statutes may have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. States in which we operate may also adopt a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such regulation will be adopted and whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, our midstream systems have not been adversely affected by recent state regulations.
Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to more stringent application of state regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Environmental Laws
Our midstream operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local level environmental laws and regulations. In addition to routine reviews and inspections by regulators to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, we have established protocols for ongoing assessments to identify potential environmental exposures. These assessments take into account industry and internal best management practices, evaluate compliance with laws and regulations and include reviews of our third-party service providers, including, for instance, waste management facilities.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our capital costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various activities in which we are presently engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. 
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities. Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, substantially all of our customers’ natural gas production on our dedicated acreage is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the well completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted certain regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has moved forward with various regulatory actions, including the issuance of new regulations requiring green completions for hydraulically fractured wells, and has disclosed its intent to develop regulations to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Some states, including states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, or otherwise seek to ban some or all of these activities. Additionally, these federal requirements and proposals may be subject to further review and revision by the EPA.

Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities also continues in other ways at the federal and local levels. For example, in June 2015, the EPA issued its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The draft report found no systemic negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be performed safely.  We cannot predict whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what its provisions will be. 
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act and corresponding state laws and regulations regulate air emissions primarily through permitting and/or emissions control requirements. Various activities in our operations are subject to air quality regulation, including pre-construction and operational permit requirements, noise and emission limits, operational limits, and monitoring, reporting and record-keeping requirements on air emission sources, including our pipeline compression stations, as well as fugitive emissions from operations. We obtain permits, typically from state or local authorities, to conduct these activities. Additionally, we are required to obtain pre-approval for construction or modification of certain facilities, to meet stringent air permit requirements, or to use specific equipment, technologies or best management practices to control emissions. Further, some states and the federal government have proposed that emissions from certain proximate and related sources should be aggregated to provide for regulation and permitting of a single, major source. Federal and state governmental agencies continue to investigate the potential for emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our cost or temporarily restrict our ability to produce. For example, the EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards for certain pollutants and changes to such standards could cause us to make additional capital expenditures or alter our business operations in some manner. See “Risk Factors—Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases at the federal or state level could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas that we gather while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to air emissions and related matters.
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding federal and state laws affect our midstream operations by regulating storm water or other regulated substance discharges, including pollutants, sediment, and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances, into surface waters, and in certain instances imposing requirements to dispose of produced 
wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or a delegated state agency. These permits require regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements, and govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Environmental regulations can increase costs and introduce uncertainty that could adversely impact our or our customers’ operations.” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to clean water, the disposal or use of water and related matters.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act and related state regulation protect plant and animal species that are threatened or endangered. Some of our operations are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Northern Long-Eared and Indiana bats, which has a seasonal impact on our construction activities and operations. New or additional species that may be identified as requiring protection or consideration may lead to delays in permits and/or other restrictions.
Safety of Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipelines. Some of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, (“NGPSA”), as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (“PSA”), the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 (“APSA”), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”). 
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. Additionally, certain states, such as West Virginia, also maintain jurisdiction over intrastate natural gas lines. Should our operations fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. PHMSA released a pre-publication copy of its final hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements, but due to the change in Presidential administrations, PHMSA’s final hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule has not yet taken effect, though PHMSA is expected to finalize its hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule soon. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines exempt from PHMSA regulations. See “Part I. Item1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline operations and related increases in the regulation of gas gathering pipelines.” for additional discussion regarding gas transmission and gathering pipelines.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect natural gas operations by imposing requirements for the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastes generated by our gathering and midstream operations. Facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to corrective action orders issued by the EPA that could adversely affect our financial results, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts certain wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas, which we handle in the course of our operation, including produced water. However, these exploration and production wastes may still be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws, and it is possible that certain exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous in the future. On December 28, 2016 the EPA entered into a consent order to resolve outstanding litigation brought by environmental and citizen groups regarding the applicability 
of RCRA to wastes from oil and gas development activities. In April 2019, the EPA issued a report concluding that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of exploration and production wastes under RCRA were not necessary at the time the report was issued. We cannot predict whether the EPA may change its conclusion at some point, or whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what their provisions will be.
Health and Safety Laws
Occupational Safety and Health Act. Our natural gas gathering and compression activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Our midstream operations are subject to regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state laws in some states, all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our natural gas operations. Additionally, OSHA's hazardous communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state laws require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and the public.
Climate Change Laws and Regulations
Climate change continues to be a legislative and regulatory focus. There are a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions, and regulations that restrict emissions could increase our costs should the requirements necessitate the installation of new equipment or the purchase of emission allowances. These laws and regulations could also impact our customers, including the electric generation industry, making alternative sources of energy more competitive. Additional regulation could also lead to permitting delays and additional monitoring and administrative requirements, as well as to impacts on electricity generating operations. See “Part I. Item1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases at the federal or state level could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas that CNXM gathers while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.” for additional discussion regarding certain laws and regulations related to climate change, greenhouse gas and related matters.
