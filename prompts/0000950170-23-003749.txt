Item 1. Business.
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references included in this Business section to “Apexigen,” “Apexigen’s,” “we,” “our,” and “us,” refer to Legacy Apexigen prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and Apexigen, Inc. following the Business Combination.
 Background of the Business Combination
 In March 2022, Brookline Capital Acquisition Corp. (“BCAC”), our legal predecessor company and a special purpose acquisition company, and Apexigen America, Inc., which was then known as Apexigen, Inc. (“Legacy Apexigen”) entered into a definitive business combination agreement (“Business Combination Agreement”). When the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement closed on July 29, 2022 (the “Business Combination”), Legacy Apexigen survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BCAC, BCAC changed its name to Apexigen, Inc., and Legacy Apexigen changed its name to Apexigen, America, Inc. On July 30, 2022, our common stock and public warrants, formerly those of BCAC’s, began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbols “APGN” and “APGNW,” respectively.
 Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, BCAC entered into subscription agreements with certain investors for a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) transaction to close concurrently with the Business Combination. In addition, concurrent with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, BCAC, Legacy Apexigen and Lincoln Park entered into a committed investment agreement under which we have the right to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our common stock over a 24-month period pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement, subject to certain limitations set forth therein, including the closing stock price of our common stock not being below $3.00 per share at the time we deliver a purchase notice to Lincoln Park.
 Legacy Apexigen was incorporated in Delaware in 2010 to focus on the discovery, development and commercialization of humanized monoclonal antibody therapies. Apexigen is headquartered in San Carlos, California.
 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing a new generation of antibody therapeutics for oncology, with an emphasis on new immuno-oncology agents designed to harness the patient’s immune system to combat and eradicate cancer. We and our licensees are researching and developing several protein therapeutics that were discovered using our APXiMAB antibody platform. We have one clinical-stage candidate, sotigalimab (“sotiga” or “APX005M”) that we are developing. We also have several preclinical and research stage antibodies we discovered using our APXiMAB platform that we are not currently advancing as we focus our resources on completing ongoing clinical and manufacturing activities for the sotiga program. Our licensees are advancing five product candidates in clinical development that were enabled by discoveries from our APXiMAB platform.
 Our clinical-stage candidate, sotigalimab, is a humanized agonist antibody that targets and activates CD40, a co-stimulatory receptor that is essential for activating both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response. Sotigalimab is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors such as soft tissue sarcomas, esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) cancers and melanoma in combination with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy.
 Our APXiMAB platform was used to enable the discovery of multiple protein therapeutic product candidates against a variety of molecular targets, including targets that are difficult to drug with conventional antibody technologies. In addition to the product candidates that we wholly own, several product candidates discovered through the use of the APXiMAB platform are in clinical development by our licensees. The most advanced of these programs is Novartis’ Beovu® (brolucizumab-dbll) product, which received FDA approval in 2019 and is marketed in over 70 countries. Two other programs being developed by our licensees are in later-stage development; Simcere’s suvemcitug (BD0801) is in Phase 3 clinical development in ovarian cancer and Mabwell’s 9MW0211 is in an adaptive, pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial in wet age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”). There is no guarantee that any of the product candidates discovered using our APXiMAB antibody platform, whether developed by us or our licensees, will receive regulatory approval.
Our Strategy
 We are focused on discovering and developing next-generation antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our goal is to leverage the power of the body’s immune system to combat and eradicate tumor cells, generating enhanced tumor-specific immunity and leading to significant clinical benefits such as improved survival for patients across a wide range of cancers. The key tenets of our business strategy to achieve this goal include:
 •Advance sotiga to registrational clinical trials with a partner. We believe sotiga could be an effective treatment in a broad range of oncology indications and therapeutic combinations. We are evaluating sotiga in combination with other immuno-oncology agents, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and cancer vaccines in multiple clinical trials in patients with solid tumors, including soft tissue sarcomas, esophageal and GEJ cancers and melanoma.
 •Invest in the advancement and expansion of our pipeline. In addition to sotiga, we plan to advance the remainder of our internal pipeline, which consists of two preclinical programs and multiple research-stage programs after we obtain adequate financial resources. We may supplement our current pipeline by selectively acquiring or exclusively in-licensing rights to develop product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
 •Leverage our APXiMAB platform to develop additional novel product candidates. Our APXiMAB platform has enabled discovery of a robust wholly owned pipeline as well as five additional product candidates that our licensees are developing. We believe there is significant opportunity to utilize our APXiMAB platform to discover and develop additional monoclonal antibodies with desirable attributes for oncology indications.
 •Establish strategic out-licenses and collaborations to supplement our development capabilities and generate funding. We plan to establish additional collaborations and out-licenses, in particular in the near term for the development and commercialization of sotigalimab and one or more of our pre-clinical product candidates. These collaborations may allow us to supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities to broaden and accelerate clinical development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and significantly reduce our share of the costs of the development and manufacturing of sotigalimab and any pre-clinical product candidates with respect to which we out-license development or commercialization rights.
 Our Out-Licensed Programs
Our APXiMAB platform was used to enable the discovery of multiple protein therapeutic product candidates against a variety of molecular targets, including targets that are difficult to drug with conventional antibody technologies. In addition to the product candidates that we wholly own, several programs for the development of product candidates discovered through the use of the APXiMAB platform are in clinical development by our licensees. The most advanced of these programs is Novartis’ Beovu® (brolucizumab-dbll) product, which received FDA approval in 2019 and is marketed in over 70 countries. Two other programs being developed by our licensees are in late-stage development: Simcere’s suvemcitug (BD0801) is in Phase 3 clinical development in ovarian cancer and Mabwell’s 9MW0211 is in an adaptive, pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial in wet age-related macular degeneration. An additional program, OCS-02, is being developed by Oculis SA and is in Phase 2 development for ocular disease, and a final program, TRK-950, is being developed by Toray Industries and is in Phase 1 development for oncology. There is no guarantee that any of the product candidates discovered using our APXiMAB antibody platform and developed by our third-party licensees will receive regulatory approval.
Background on Immuno-oncology
Immuno-oncology therapeutics harness the power of the immune system to treat cancer. This class of therapeutics has transformed patient care over the last decade. Immunosurveillance and activation of the immune system is mediated by both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms and normally protects patients from tumor growth and metastasis. Antigen-presenting cells (“APCs”), including dendritic cells (“DCs”) and monocytes, are also key mediators of innate immunity, recognizing cancer cells and destroying them via phagocytosis or by recruiting and activating adaptive immune cells through direct cell contact and effective presentation of cancer-specific antigens in concert with costimulatory molecules and cytokines. Adaptive immune cells can mediate durable anti-tumor immunity by multiple mechanisms including production of anti-tumor antibodies by B cells and direct cytotoxicity by CD8 T cells.
 While the immune system may initially control tumor formation and growth, over time, tumor cells may evolve to evade recognition and elimination by immune cells. These evasion strategies involve modulation of activating and inhibitory immune checkpoint pathways. Currently, many approved therapeutic antibodies target T cells by blocking inhibitory checkpoint molecules, including CTLA-4 and PD-1. While these antibodies have shown efficacy in certain subsets of patients, the majority of patients are refractory to treatment, suggesting that the treatment of cancer requires additional approaches which employ diverse or additional mechanisms of action that facilitated the engagement of both innate and adaptive immune components.
 Sotigalimab (APX005M) Program
 Harnessing the body’s immune system through immunotherapies is an effective means of treating patients with cancer. For example, immune checkpoint inhibitors to PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 have shown meaningful increases in overall patient survival. Most tumors, however, are either resistant to checkpoint inhibition or become resistant after treatment. Immune suppressive mechanisms of resistance include reductions in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and impaired T cell function. Restoring or increasing T cell functionality and infiltration is believed to be crucial to cancer treatment, with the potential to overcome checkpoint inhibition resistance, enhance the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or vaccine therapy, and increase survival.
 DCs are APCs that provide signaling leading to T cell activation, function and infiltration. CD40, which is predominantly expressed on APCs such as DCs, is a key mediator of this activation. Activation of CD40 initiates and amplifies a multi-cellular immune response, bringing different components of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to work in concert and resulting in increased antigen presentation, maturation of DCs and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells and neutrophils to attack tumor cells.
 Sotiga is a CD40 agonist antibody that we designed to maximize its agonistic properties through:
 •Unique epitope specificity to mimic the binding of CD40 ligand (“CD40L”) to the CD40 receptor binding site for increased potency;
 •An engineered increase in binding to Fc gamma receptor 2B (FcgRIIB) to increase antibody cross-linking and antitumor potency; and
 •An engineered reduction in binding to Fc gamma receptor 3a (FcgRIIIa) to eliminate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) effects on CD40-expressing APCs.
 We believe that sotiga’s ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity enhances tumor infiltration of immune and proinflammatory cells such as M1 macrophages and T cells and immune stimulatory cytokines such as interferon-g. Tumors with an inflamed phenotype tend to be more responsive to anti-cancer therapies. We therefore believe sotiga may combine well with and enhance the efficacy of other immuno-oncology agents, targeted therapeutics, chemotherapies, vaccines and radiation therapy to improve outcomes for patients.

Figure 1: Sotiga Targets CD40: A Key Pathway in Stimulating Immune Response in Cancer



We have studied sotiga in over a dozen company-sponsored or investigator- or cooperative group-sponsored clinical trials in numerous tumor settings as both a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapies, radiation therapies, immuno-oncology therapeutics and cancer vaccines. None of these clinical trials was powered to determine statistical significance over a control arm. We have dosed over 500 patients with sotiga across these studies, generating a significant amount of safety and efficacy data to guide our continued development of sotiga. The data to date demonstrate that sotiga is reasonably well tolerated as a monotherapy and also in combination with other cancer therapeutics. The serious adverse effects ("SAEs") considered at least possibly related to sotiga across all clinical trials reported in more than one subject were cytokine release syndrome (n= 16, ~3%), blood bilirubin increased (n= 3,<0.6%), infusion-related reaction (n= 3,<0.6%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (n=3, <0.6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (n= 2,<0.4%), colitis (n=2, <0.4%), pyrexia (n= 2, <0.4%), thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased (n=2, <0.4%) and pancreatitis/ acute pancreatitis (n=2, <04%). Following the data cut, a new SAE of hepatic failure (dysfunction) was reported, bringing the number of hepatic failure (dysfunction) cases to two (<0.4%). In several clinical trials, sotiga was dosed in combination in with other therapeutics, including anti-PD-1 antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation, and in several of the SAEs listed above such as colitis, the events were also considered related to the other components of the combination such as an anti-PD-1 antibody. We have observed single-agent anti-tumor activity, including complete responses (“CRs”) in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had not previously received immuno-oncology therapeutics, and efficacy in combination with antibodies to PD-1 or PD-L1 (together, “PD-(L)1”), chemotherapies and radiation therapies in Phase 2 clinical development in multiple tumor settings. Our current clinical development activities are focused on completing the enrollment and treatment of patients with advanced sarcoma with sotiga in combination with doxorubicin.
Sotiga in Advanced Sarcoma
 Background
 In 2021, there were approximately 13,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma (including heart cancer) in the United States resulting in over 5,300 deaths. The overall prevalence in the United States in 2018 was approximately 158,000 cases. The five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic sarcoma is approximately 15%.
 Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies of mesenchymal origin. More than 50 subtypes are defined, each with distinct clinical and biologic features. Chemotherapy remains the standard approach for most soft tissue sarcoma subtypes when disease is unresectable or metastatic. Doxorubicin and the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel are front-line chemotherapy regimens used for initial treatment of most soft tissue sarcoma. Across several recent large randomized controlled studies evaluating new agents in sarcoma, response rates in the doxorubicin control were between 5-19%. In a recent Phase 3 study of olaratumab, the doxorubicin control arm was reported to have an overall response rate ("ORR") of 18.3% and a median progression-free survival ("mPFS") of 6.8 months in the soft tissue sarcoma population. Studies of immunotherapy-based approaches for the treatment of sarcoma have shown limited efficacy to date. Newer and more effective treatments are needed in this difficult-to-treat indication.
 In August 2021, the FDA granted us Orphan Drug Designation for sotigalimab for the treatment of soft tissue carcinoma.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sotiga in Combination with Doxorubicin
 We are collaborating with Columbia University on a multi-center, investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03719430) of sotiga in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (the APX005M-009 Trial). This trial completed enrollment of the originally planned 32 patients in January 2023. In November 2022, we announced that we had observed a mPFS of 12.45 months (data as of September 27, 2022) in the evaluable patients (n=10) with advanced/unresectable or metastatic de-differentiated liposarcoma (LPS). Based on the mPFS observed in these LPS patients, which is meaningfully higher than the historical mPFS of patients with LPS who are treated with standard-of-care doxorubicin alone, we and our collaborator Columbia University decided to expand the LPS cohort to enroll 10 additional patients with LPS to supplement the data we have observed and potentially inform a registration-enabling study in de-differentiated LPS.
Sotiga in Anti-PD-(L)1 Refractory Melanoma
 Background
 In 2020, there were an estimated 324,000 new cases of melanoma of skin worldwide resulting in over 57,000 deaths. The five-year survival rate for patients whose melanoma is diagnosed while it is still localized and treated early is greater than 95%. However, melanoma is more likely to spread than other skin cancers in patients with later stage diagnoses. In general, treatments for advanced melanoma can be effective but rarely curative. For patients with distant spread of melanoma at diagnosis, the five-year relative survival rate is approximately 30%.
 The current standard-of-care treatment for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma includes immuno-oncology agents such as anti-PD-1 drugs (e.g., pembrolizumab and nivolumab), the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, the anti-LAG-3 antibody, relatlimab, and BRAF/MEK inhibitors for tumors that harbor specific gene mutations. These drugs have shown responses in approximately 15% to 40% of melanoma patients and extended the progression-free survival (“PFS”) and overall survival (“OS”) of patients receiving these therapies. Despite these treatments, the majority of patients have not had durable responses and have relapsed. For those patients whose disease progresses following approved targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens, treatment options are limited to minimally active agents that include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and investigational agents. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new effective treatments.
 Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial of Sotiga in Combination with Nivolumab
 In 2021, we completed a Phase 1b/2 open-label trial (NCT03123783) in which we studied sotiga in combination with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that had progressive disease (PD) during treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy as one arm of a multi-indication trial (the "APX005M-002 Trial"). Eligible patients with melanoma had to have documented disease progression by two consecutive tumor assessments.
 In the Phase 1b portion of the APX005M-002 Trial, we evaluated sotiga at three dose levels administered every three weeks in combination with nivolumab (360mg). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred and 0.3 mg/kg of sotiga administered every three weeks was determined to be the recommended dose for use in the Phase 2 portion (RP2D) of the study.
 In the Phase 2 portion of the APX005M-002 Trial, 38 patients with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory metastatic melanoma were enrolled and evaluable for safety and 33 of these patients were evaluable for efficacy. Of the efficacy-evaluable patients, 14 (42%) had elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, a poor prognostic indicator of response to PD-(L)1 blockade therapy, seven (21%) had received two or more prior lines of therapy and eight (24%) had previously been treated with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody.
 There were five partial responses (“PRs”) in the trial for an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 15.2% and ten patients with stable disease (“SD”) (30.3%). The duration of response (“DoR”) as determined in the trial ranged from 4.1+ to 24.7+ months, and was measured from the first documented PR to the earlier of the date of progression or the last imaging study prior to the end of the trial even if the patient was in an ongoing PR. Four of the responding patients remained in an ongoing PR at the completion of the trial, after which we ceased following and monitoring these patients for progression. The fifth responding patient developed an isolated brain lesion approximately nine months after stopping combination therapy (DoR of approximately 18.7 months), subsequently received radiation therapy for the brain lesion, and did not require any further local or systemic therapy through the end of the trial. The duration of SD was up to 14.0+ months and the majority of patients with SD had a duration of SD lasting longer than 3.5 months. These data suggest that treatment with sotiga in combination with nivolumab resulted in clinical benefits in PD-1 blockade refractory patients by achieving durable objective tumor responses and stable disease.

In the APX005M-002 Trial, we observed that the combination of sotiga and nivolumab could be administered to patients with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory melanoma repeatedly for greater than one year with an acceptable safety profile. The majority of adverse events (“AEs”) considered related to sotiga, nivolumab or the combination were transient and grade 1 or 2. The most common AEs consisted of fever, fatigue, chills, headache, nausea, pruritus, vomiting, rash, arthralgias, myalgias, and elevated liver function tests. No SAEs or deaths were considered related to the study drugs and no treatment withdrawals or discontinuations were reported as due to AEs related to sotiga. The incidence of immune-related adverse events was low, and the AEs were similar in nature to those that have been reported with nivolumab alone. There were no reported cases of cytokine release syndrome.
 We believe the data observed in the APX005M-002 Trial support the advancement of the development of sotiga as a potential treatment in combination with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that had progressive disease during treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Accordingly, in June 2022, we discussed with the FDA in a Type C meeting our plans for a registration-enabling study of sotiga in this combination and setting. We received feedback and support from the FDA for a potential randomized registration-enabling clinical trial of sotigalimab in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor to treat patients with PD-1 blockade refractory melanoma, which potential trial would compare the combination of sotigalimab and a PD-1 inhibitor against an investigator’s choice of standard of care therapy and would demonstrate the contribution of sotigalimab and the PD-1 inhibitor as components of the combination regimen. Due to the development potential of sotiga in other oncology settings, the significant cost of conducting a subsequent trial of sotiga in this setting, our current resources and the state of the capital markets, we do not plan to develop sotiga in this setting independently and are seeking to engage a global collaboration partner to advance the development of sotiga in this and other settings.
 Sotiga in Esophageal and GEJ Cancer
 Background
 Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the eighth most common cancer worldwide. Approximately 19,000 and 604,000 new cases of esophageal cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2020 in the United States and worldwide, respectively, resulting in over 15,000 and 544,000 deaths in the United States and worldwide, respectively. The overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the United States is approximately 20%. Trends for histologic subtypes have been shifting, with the incidence of adenocarcinomas steadily climbing in the past several decades compared to the more common squamous cell carcinoma. Today, adenocarcinomas present the predominant subtype in the United States and European countries compared to squamous cell carcinoma, which is the major histologic type in Asia and other countries.
 In October 2020, the FDA granted us Orphan Drug Designation for sotigalimab for the treatment of esophageal and GEJ cancers.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sotiga as a Neoadjuvant Therapy
 In December 2021, we completed enrollment of 34 patients in our Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03165994) to study sotiga in combination with standard-of-care chemoradiation as a neoadjuvant treatment for patients with respectable esophageal or GEJ cancer (the “APX005M-006 Trial”). The primary objective of the APX005M-006 Trial is to assess the efficacy of the combination, as measured by the pathologic complete response ("pCR") rate, and to further characterize the safety and feasibility of the combination in this setting.
 In September 2022, we reported results and data from our APX005M-006 Trial that were featured in a poster presentation at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The data presented from the APX005M-006 Trial showed that sotiga combined with neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal and GEJ cancers was generally safe and well tolerated. The majority of patients treated in the trial had Grade 1-2 AEs. Six serious AEs considered at least possibly related to sotiga included cytokine release syndrome observed in three patients, nausea and vomiting in one patient, dysphagia in one patient and Guillain-Barre Syndrome in one patient. There were no patient withdrawals due to sotiga and no deaths related to the combination. As of July 2022, of the 29 evaluable patients, 11 (38%) patients had a pCR and 19 (66%) patients had a mPR (major pathological response) with less than 10% of the residual tumor remaining after treatment. By histology, the pCR rate was 33% (8/24) in patients with adenocarcinoma and 60% (3/5) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The pCR rate was 41.2% for patients (n= 17) receiving four doses of sotiga versus 33.3% for patients (n= 12) receiving three doses. The R0 resection was achieved in 86% (25/29) of the patients and progressive disease was only 7%. Paired biomarker analysis collected before and one to two weeks following a single run-in dose of sotiga alone demonstrated significantly increased tumor infiltration of activated dendritic cells, monocytes and both CD8 and CD4 T cells compared to baseline. We believe that the observed immune/inflammatory response in the tumor demonstrates the ability of sotiga to change the tumor immune microenvironment from “cold” to “hot”, which we believe validates sotiga’s mechanism of action.

We believe the data observed in the APX005M-006 Trial support the advancement of the development of sotiga as a potential treatment in combination with other therapeutics in patients with esophageal or GEJ cancer. However, due to the development potential of sotiga in other oncology settings, the significant cost of conducting a subsequent trial of sotiga to explore use as a treatment in patients with esophageal or GEJ cancer, our current resources and the state of the capital markets, we do not plan to develop sotiga in this setting independently and are seeking to engage a global collaboration partner to advance the development of sotiga in this and other settings.
 Our APXiMAB Platform
 Our APXiMAB platform was used to discover all of our wholly owned product candidates and several programs for the development of product candidates that we have out-licensed. Our proprietary APXiMAB platform is comprised of two primary components:
 •Generation of hybridomas from rabbit B cells using fusion cell lines which enable us to reproducibly generate large numbers of rabbit monoclonal antibodies; and
 •Humanization of these antibodies using our multi lineage guided (MLG) humanization technology.
 Advantages of Rabbit Antibodies
 Rabbits offer numerous advantages over other animal species for the generation of therapeutic antibodies. Unlike rodents and humans, which rely primarily on VDJ rearrangement (variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segment rearrangements), rabbits use an additional process called gene conversion, to generate a broad and diverse antibody repertoire.
 Rabbit antibodies offer:
 •diverse epitope recognition to enable fit-for-purpose therapeutic antibody generation;
 •the ability to recognize epitopes that are not immunogenic in other species, including small-size epitopes; and
 •high affinity and specificity.
 Our Hybridoma Technology
 Despite the multiple advantages of rabbit-derived antibodies, they were generally not used as a source of monoclonal antibodies until Epitomics, our predecessor, developed a fusion cell line capable of generating stable hybridoma clones, which enables us to generate high quality rabbit-derived antibodies from hybridoma cell lines.
 Our antibody generation process begins with immunization of rabbits from which B cells are isolated and fused to a rabbit myeloma cell line, generating hybridoma cells capable of stably producing rabbit antibodies. These antibodies are screened for desired properties such as affinity and specificity and evaluated in panels of biochemical and cellular assays.

Figure 2: The APXiMAB Platform Process
 


Our Proprietary MLG Humanization Technology
 To facilitate drug development, we humanize these rabbit monoclonal antibodies using our proprietary MLG humanization technology. Antibodies generated in non-human species and given to people as drugs can induce the formation of antibodies that neutralize the antibody drug or induce an undesirable immune response. These are often referred to as anti-drug antibodies or ADAs. Most therapeutic antibodies are therefore modified to have their sequences resemble human antibody sequences as much as possible in an attempt to avoid the development of ADAs.
 In conventional humanization, sequences of antibodies derived from non-human species are altered to be closer to human antibody sequences by replacing the sequences of the antibody scaffold with that of human scaffolds. This creates a novel antibody in which the majority of the sequence comes from human antibody genes and the antigen-binding portions from the originating non-human species.
 In our MLG humanization technology, we examine the antibody sequences generated in rabbits to better understand the importance of various residues both in the antigen-binding portions and the antibody scaffold. Residues that are highly conserved are preserved while other residues that are highly variable in the sequences of the rabbit antibodies are replaced with conservative amino acid substitutions found in human antibodies. Because our MLG technology enables humanization of antigen-binding regions, we believe that this process results in humanized antibodies that maintain the desired characteristics of the original rabbit antibody, including high affinity, while reducing immunogenicity.
 Our Antibody Engineering Expertise
 We deploy our knowledge of immunology and experience with therapeutic antibodies to engineer desirable features into our product candidates. For example, we incorporated the S267E mutation into the Fc portion of sotiga with the goal of achieving better potency and safety. This mutation, which had previously been described in scientific literature, changes the binding affinity to FcγRIIb and FcγRIIIa receptors to increase cross-linking and the potency of sotiga and reduce immune activation in circulation, where less FcR crosslinking occurs. Elimination of binding to FcγRIIIa minimizes ADCC and consequently prevents the depletion of CD40-expressing immune cells. Binding of sotiga to the CD40 ligand binding domain mimics that of the natural CD40 ligand and enhancing sotiga’s activation of CD40. We have employed other strategies to design favorable properties into our product candidates.
Our Out-License Relationships
 Our APXiMAB platform has enabled the discovery of multiple protein therapeutic product candidates with potential utility in multiple therapeutic areas. We have licenses with several biopharmaceutical companies that are developing product candidates that were discovered using our APXiMAB platform, which has been important to prosecuting the full value of our platform. We believe the licenses for the programs for the development of product candidates we have helped generate demonstrate the productivity and utility of our platform and position us to receive meaningful royalty payments if those product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized. Described below are the out-license relationships and the related agreements under which we may receive milestone or royalty payments. The aggregate payments received from these relationships as of December 31, 2022 include milestone payments of approximately $3.6 million, upfront or execution payments of approximately $1.9 million, and other service-related payments of approximately $0.3 million. Apexigen has also recorded $5.7 million in deferred revenue relating to certain royalty payments made under the ESBATech Agreement as of December 31, 2022.
Beovu and Novartis Antibody Candidate Discovery and Development Agreement
 Our predecessor, Epitomics, entered into an antibody candidate discovery and development agreement with ESBATech AG in March 2007 (the “ESBATech Agreement”). In September 2009, Alcon Research, Ltd. ("ARL") acquired ESBATech and in April 2011 ARL’s parent, Alcon, Inc. merged with Novartis AG (“Novartis”). Epitomics assigned the ESBATech Agreement to us in connection with our spin-out from Epitomics.
 Under the ESBATech Agreement, Epitomics provided to ESBATech antibodies discovered using the APXiMAB platform that target certain molecules. ESBATech used those antibodies to develop drug product candidates to two different drug targets. Under the ESBATech Agreement, we granted ESBATech a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing and perpetual license to our rights in certain intellectual property to develop and commercialize those drug product candidates. Other than financial interests, we do not have any ownership or right in those drug product candidates or any intellectual property covering or enabling the manufacture, use or sale of those drug product candidates.
 Novartis, the successor in interest to ESBATech, has successfully developed and begun commercializing one of those drug product candidates, brolucizumab-dbll, a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) targeting all of the isoforms of VEGF-A, which Novartis markets under the brand name Beovu®. Beovu is approved for use in over 70 countries and indicated for the treatment of neovascular (wet) AMD and has received European Commission approval for the use of Beovu for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema. Novartis is also developing Beovu for additional uses in several Phase 3 clinical trials.
 In or around January 2019, Novartis licensed to Oculis SA another of the drug product candidates covered by the ESBATech Agreement, which was named LME636. Oculis renamed the drug candidate OCS-02. OCS-02 is a topical single-chain anti-TNF alpha antibody fragment. Oculis is in Phase 2 development of OCS-02 for the treatment of dry eye and uveitis.
 Novartis and its predecessors have paid all of the upfront fee and milestone payments due under the ESBATech Agreement. The term of the ESBATech Agreement expired in March 2010; however, Novartis’ royalty payment obligations under the agreement survive indefinitely. Novartis is obligated to pay Apexigen a very low single-digit royalty on worldwide net sales of Beovu and OCS-02 for therapeutic uses by Novartis, its affiliates or licensees in perpetuity. In October 2019, Novartis’ Beovu was approved for commercial sale. However, Novartis has disputed its obligation to pay royalties to Apexigen under the ESBATech Agreement and continues to pay such royalties under protest. As a result, Apexigen has determined that any sales-based royalty revenue Apexigen has earned under the ESBATech Agreement is currently fully constrained and Apexigen has recorded the royalty proceeds as deferred revenue in its balance sheets in an aggregate amount of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2022.

Simcere License and Collaboration Agreement
 In December 2008, Epitomics and Jiangsu Simcere Pharmaceutical R&D Co., Ltd. (Simcere) entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Simcere Agreement”) for the development and commercialization of suvemcitug (BD0801) for oncology in the People’s Republic of China (“China”). Suvemcitug is, a humanized anti-VEGF rabbit monoclonal antibody molecule. In connection with our spin-out from Epitomics, Epitomics assigned the Simcere Agreement to us. Simcere is responsible for conducting the development and commercialization of suvemcitug in China at its cost. We have reserved the right to develop and commercialize suvemcitug outside of China at our discretion. If we develop and commercialize suvemcitug outside of China, we will share with Simcere costs incurred and revenue earned outside of China. Under the Simcere Agreement, Simcere has an exclusive, royalty-bearing license (without the right to sublicense) to our rights in certain intellectual property that we licensed from Epitomics to develop and commercialize suvemcitug in the field of oncology therapeutics in China. Simcere granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license (without the right to sublicense) to improvements derived from suvemcitug using the intellectual property we licensed to Simcere for any purpose outside of China and for purposes outside of oncology therapeutics in China. Intellectual property created in our collaboration program with Simcere is jointly owned by us and Simcere. Simcere is obligated to pay us milestone payments for achievement of certain clinical development milestones and low to high single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of suvemcitug in China until 15 years after the first commercial sale of suvemcitug. If we choose to commercialize suvemcitug outside of China, we share with Simcere a mid-double-digit percentage of costs and revenue arising from the development and commercialization of suvemcitug outside of China. Unless earlier terminated, the Simcere Agreement continues until 15 years after the first commercial sale of suvemcitug. Either party may terminate the Simcere Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. Simcere may terminate the Simcere Agreement upon a decision by an appellate court in China that suvemcitug infringes a third party patent and such dispute cannot be resolved by settlement, licensing or other alternatives. Simcere is currently developing suvemcitug in Phase 3 clinical development for use in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
 T-Mab/Mabwell Agreement
 In May 2008, Jiangsu T-Mab Biotechnology Ltd., Co. (“T-Mab”) entered into a license, co-development and contract manufacture agreement (the “T-Mab Agreement”) with Epitomics for the development and commercialization of therapeutic candidates in two therapeutic programs, each directed to a specified target for specified fields, including VEGF for the treatment of ocular diseases, in China. Epitomics assigned the T-Mab Agreement to us in connection with our spin-out from Epitomics. Mabwell (Shanghai) Bioscience Co., Ltd. (“Mabwell”) acquired T-Mab in 2015. Mabwell is responsible for conducting the development and commercialization of the therapeutic candidates in China. We may, at our discretion, develop and commercialize such therapeutic candidates outside of China, however, we must pay Mabwell a royalty on sales of such therapeutic candidates made outside of China if we do so. Under the agreement, we granted Mabwell an exclusive, royalty-bearing, perpetual license (without the right to sublicense) to our rights in certain intellectual property that we licensed from Epitomics to develop and commercialize such therapeutic candidates. Mabwell is obligated to pay us a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of such therapeutic candidates in China. If we choose to commercialize such therapeutic candidates outside of China, we would be obligated to pay Mabwell a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of such therapeutic candidates outside of China that we sell directly to end users and a mid-single-digit percentage of revenue we receive as sublicense fees, milestone payments and royalties related to the sale of such therapeutic candidate. Each party’s obligations to pay royalties to the other party continue until 15 years after the first commercial sale of licensed product in each party’s respective territory. The term of the T-Mab Agreement expired in May 2013; however, Mabwell’s royalty payment obligations under the agreement survive expiration. The royalty term for 9MW0211, an anti-VEGF antibody licensed under the T-Mab Agreement, will begin on the first commercial sale in China and end a low two-digit number of years after such first commercial sale. Mabwell is currently in Phase 3 development of 9MW0211.
 Toray Sublicense Agreement
 Under an agreement between Epitomics and Toray Industries, Inc. (“Toray”), Epitomics provided Toray with antibodies created using the APXiMAB platform that target certain molecules to use in the development of its drug product candidates. In May 2012, we entered into a non-exclusive sublicense agreement with Toray (the “Toray Agreement”) under which we granted Toray a non-exclusive, worldwide sublicense, with the right to grant further sublicenses, under the intellectual property that we licensed from Epitomics to develop and commercialize drug product candidates that Toray develops using those antibodies in the field of pharmaceutical products for human or veterinary use. Under the Toray Agreement, Toray paid us an upfront fee, and agreed to pay us certain development- and regulatory-related milestone payments and a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products by Toray or its affiliates. Toray is also obligated to pay us a mid-teens percentage of certain payments Toray receives from sublicensees under the Toray Agreement, which payments may limit Toray’s obligations to pay the milestone payments described above. Subject to certain termination rights, including Toray’s right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice, the agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Upon expiration or early termination of the agreement, Toray’s sublicense and any further sublicenses granted by Toray will automatically terminate. Toray is currently in Phase 1b development of TRK-950, an antibody licensed under the Toray Agreement.
Competition
 The biotechnology industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Moreover, the oncology field is characterized by strong and increasing competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. Sotiga and products we may develop in the future for the treatment of cancer and any other diseases are likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies, including those of which we may not currently be aware. In addition, our products may need to compete with off-label drugs used by physicians to treat the indications for which we seek approval. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with our products.
 Major multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, emerging and start-up companies, universities and other research institutions could focus their future efforts on developing competing therapies and treatments for any of the targets or indications we are currently targeting or may target in the future. For example, each of Hoffman-La Roche AG, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (in collaboration with Alligator Bioscience AB), Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Seagan Inc., Eucure Biopharma, a subsidiary of Biocytogen, Lygen Pharma and AbbVie Inc. are developing CD40-based antibody product candidates for solid tumor oncology indications, typically in combination therapies, and other companies and institutions have other CD40-based product candidates in development.
 Many of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, commercial, drug development and technical expertise and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research, development and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late later stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete.
 Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These smaller and large companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for planned clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies that may be complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Manufacturing
 We must manufacture drug substance and drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) regulations. The GMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality controls and stability, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet GMP requirements and FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority’s satisfaction before any product is approved and sold commercially. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic facility inspections by the FDA and other foreign authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our product candidates to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 We do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture our product candidates for use in clinical development or commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our product candidates in compliance with GMP requirements. For sotiga and our preclinical candidate, APX601, we rely on a single third-party manufacturer, WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (“WuXi”), and we currently have no alternative manufacturer in place for drug substance or drug product for both sotiga and APX601. We have a non-exclusive clinical supply agreement with WuXi in which WuXi manufactures sotiga and APX601 on a fee-for-service basis in addition to providing certain process development services. For the APX601 product candidate, we have successfully completed a drug substance and drug product runs at WuXi.
 We originally manufactured sotiga at another third-party manufacturer. The clinical supply we are currently using was manufactured by that other third-party manufacturer. We expect the quantity and stability of our current supply of sotiga from that prior manufacturer will be sufficient to supply our currently ongoing clinical trials through mid-2023. We have developed with Wuxi a new cell line and manufacturing process and analytical methods for sotiga to meet our clinical supply needs by mid-2023.
 We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, including GMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes.

Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Any of these actions or events could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
 Commercialization Plan
 We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. As a result, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs. When and if any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a commercialization infrastructure for those products in various key markets. We may also rely on partnerships to provide commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, programs, and know-how related to our business, to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others, to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, and to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and related components, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business.
 We also rely on trademarks as well as trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms, and product candidates to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We believe that we have substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates and we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect.
 Sotigalimab
 Our patent portfolio for our sotigalimab program includes U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, all of which are wholly owned by us. The patent portfolio includes claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, companion diagnostics, biomarkers, combination therapies and formulations relating to sotigalimab. Our issued U.S. patents and issued or allowed foreign patents, including one or more issued or allowed patents in each of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Macau, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom expire between 2032 and 2033, without giving effect to any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions that may be available. Patents that may issue from the pending U.S. and foreign applications would expire, if issued, between 2032 and 2042, without giving effect to any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions that may be available.
Platform Technology
 We have an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain rights controlled by Epitomics, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Abcam, to develop and commercialize rabbit monoclonal antibodies generated using Epitomics’ technology and fragments thereof, each in the field of pharmaceutical products for human or veterinary use. We entered into this license with Epitomics in 2010 in connection with our spin-out from Epitomics. The intellectual property licensed to us by Epitomics includes patents that generally relate to our APXiMAB platform and that cover antibody generation and a process for humanizing antibodies, as well as related know-how and materials. We have the sole right to enforce the patents licensed by Epitomics for infringement arising in our field of use and a step-in right to control the filing, prosecution and maintenance of any patent or patent application licensed to us by Epitomics that Epitomics determines not to file or decides to abandon. If we elect to file or prosecute any such patent or patent application, Epitomics would assign the relevant patent or patent application to us. Those patents begin to expire in 2023. We do not believe the expiration of these patents will have a material impact on our business. We are obligated to pay Epitomics 10% of certain amounts that we receive from third parties if we grant a sublicense to the Epitomics technology, with such amounts capped at $1 million per target. By its terms, the agreement expired in 2020 and the license granted by Epitomics to us became irrevocable. Our obligation to pay Epitomics a share of amounts we receive in consideration of a sublicense survives this expiration only with respect to sublicenses granted prior to expiration of the agreement. The ESBATech Agreement, Simcere Agreement, T-Mab Agreement and Toray Agreement (the “Out-License Agreements”) were each entered into prior to the expiration of our license agreement with Epitomics. Therefore, certain payments we receive under the Out-License Agreements with respect to sublicenses of the Epitomics technology, including certain payments made with respect to Beovu, OCS-02, suvemcitug, 9MW0211 and TRK-950 under the Out-License Agreements, will be subject to the payment obligations we have under our license agreement with Epitomics. Abcam plc (“Abcam”) acquired Epitomics in 2012.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process or post-approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biologic and non-biologic drug product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a Biologics License Application ("BLA") or New Drug Application ("NDA") process, respectively, before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”)
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;

•submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical Studies and IND
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.

Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, which may overlap.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, tolerability, and safety of the drug in humans, and side effects associated with increasing doses for determining a safe clinical dosage range in humans.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use and its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other trials suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug or biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that an investigational product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent and length of which are uncertain, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect trial participants from COVID-19 in accordance with new or updated FDA guidance and other regulatory requirements. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including the requirement to include in the clinical trial report contingency measures implemented to manage the trial and any disruption of the trial as a result of COVID-19 and the impact of implemented contingency measures on the safety and efficacy results reported for the trial. The FDA has also published other COVID-19-related industry guidance regarding GMPs, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.
NDA/BLA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity, and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s FY 2023 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2023, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is approximately $3.2 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug or biologic (approximately $393,933 in FY 2023) and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs and biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. If the FDA determines there is significance to any missing or incomplete information in the context of the proposed product candidate, the proposed indication(s), and the amount of time needed to address any given deficiency, it can issue a refusal-to-file letter. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with GMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.

The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA or BLA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or ongoing development programs as well as regulations that apply to approved products.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication.
 Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (“LEMS”), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA or NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA or NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA or NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA or NDA.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
 The ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
 •analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
 •animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
 •a clinical trial or trials (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
 In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:
 •the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
 •the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;

•the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
 •the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
 Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
 •the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
 •the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
 •for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical, and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
 The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity, or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
 The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical, or clinical trials and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an orphan drug) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the 12-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.

The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and the implementation of other risk management measures. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
 •applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;

•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, financial arrangements with healthcare providers and other business arrangements, including, but not limited to, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs, also must comply with state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and transparency and reporting laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, may result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. HIPAA also created additional federal civil and criminal penalties for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The ACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the government and these reports are posted on a website maintained by CMS. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security requirements that may impact the way in which we conduct research and operate our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as individuals and entities that provide services on behalf of a covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates. In addition, we may be directly subject to certain state laws concerning privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect in January 2020 and became enforceable in July 2020. The CCPA created new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as the word is broadly defined in the law) and placed increased privacy and security obligations on many organizations that handle personal information of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers a new right to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provides consumers with a new cause of action for certain data breaches. Additionally, California voters voted to approve the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in November 2020, which modifies the CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CCPA and CPRA may impact our business activities and increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and/or enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal, and administrative penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: changes to our manufacturing arrangements; additions or modifications to product labeling; the recall or discontinuation of our products; or additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

U.S. Patent-Term Extension and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent claiming a new biologic or drug product as partial compensation for a patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. In addition, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 European Union Drug Development
 In Europe, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization (“MA”) from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.

In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted, and entered into application on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.
 European Union Drug Review and Approval
 In the EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a MA. There are two types of MAs.
 •The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In Europe, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union General Data Protection Regulation
 In addition to EU regulations related to the approval and commercialization of our products, we may be subject to the EU’s GDPR. The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the European Union, as well as potential fines for noncompliant companies of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The regulation imposes numerous new requirements for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including more stringent requirements relating to consent and the information that must be shared with data subjects about how their personal information is used, the obligation to notify regulators and affected individuals of personal data breaches, extensive new internal privacy governance obligations and obligations to honor expanded rights of individuals in relation to their personal information (e.g., the right to access, correct and delete their data). In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfer. The GDPR will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Further, the United Kingdom’s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of Average Manufacturing Price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and Part B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug candidates, restrict, or regulate post-approval activities and affect a biopharmaceutical company’s ability to profitably sell any approved drugs.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private third-party payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 The ACA has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On January 2, 2013, the then-U.S. President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products.
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain IND products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its product candidates available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework could reduce our ability to generate revenue in the future or increase our costs, either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payers of healthcare services and medical products to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect the demand for our product candidates, if approved, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
