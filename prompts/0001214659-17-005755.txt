Item 1. | Description of Business
--------+------------------------



Arax Holdings Corp. (the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 23, 2012 with a business plan to sell hot dogs from mobile hot dog stands throughout the major cities in Mexico. As of the filing of the 10K for last year, the Company stated that it was re-evaluating its business plan.
 
It was further indicated as possible that a new business model could be related to a new business sector other than the food sector, and that any new business model could entail a capital restructuring of the Company in order to provide new capital and a broader base of shareholders. Such a capital restructuring of the Company could involve a merger or acquisition of assets through various techniques, including a possible reverse-merger. At October 31, 2016, and as of the date of this filing, Management believes that the best business model for our investors is to pursue business activity in the Life Sciences sector of the United States and possibly internationally. We will continue to assess these opportunities and structures as well as the various pre-requisite actions needed to finalize and implement any new business model.
 
The Company was a majority-owned subsidiary of Thru Pharma, LLC, and these financials are presented on a stand-alone basis. All transactions with Thru Pharma have been identified in Note 5: Related party transactions. As of March 1, 2017, upon merger with Kasten, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Kasten”), whereby Kasten was the surviving corporation, the Company was effectively spun out whereby Chief Executive Officer, Steven J. Keough will be the majority shareholder.
 
Pursuant to a revision to a certain Consulting Agreement dated as of October 8, 2013, by and between Thru Pharma and Strategic Universal Advisors, LLC (“Strategic”), as amended effective January 17, 2014, on or about February 9, 2015, and most recently on October 20, 2015, with full effect as of April 1, 2015 (the “Consulting Agreement”), Thru Pharma and Strategic agreed that the intent of the Consulting Agreement ab initio was to provide Strategic with a 3% equity ownership of Thru Pharma in the event that a PUBCO M&A transaction did not occur prior to the end of the Consulting Agreement. Thru Pharma and Strategic agreed and stipulated that 753,504 shares of Arax Holdings would equal 3% of Thru Pharma as the equity payment under the Consulting Agreement, with transfer subject to the further provisions stated below. As Thru Pharma was the sole beneficiary of the services provided by Strategic under the Consulting Agreement, no part of the value of the consideration for services provided under the Consulting Agreement has been recognized as an expense by the Company. As of September 25, 2017, these shares have not been issued by the Company. The Company will issue these shares once it becomes fully reporting.
 
In connection with earlier amendments to the Consulting Agreement, Strategic granted to Mr. Keough, a control person of the Company and Thru Pharma, an irrevocable proxy (the “Irrevocable Proxy”), to vote all of the common stock in the Company under certain conditions. That proxy no longer exists under the terms of the most recent amendment.
 
As part of the currently amended Consulting Agreement, Thru Pharma agreed to transfer 753,504 Company shares to Strategic upon the closing of a merger or acquisition (an “M&A Transaction”) of a public entity, resulting in Thru Pharma being the controlling owner of the entity that was the subject of the M&A Transaction, and Thru Pharma would cause such entity to also issue to Strategic a stock warrant to purchase 600,000 (six hundred thousand) shares of common stock of the entity that was the subject of the M&A Transaction. Such warrant will be of five-year duration, exercisable at $0.10 per share, and shall vest in four equal amounts of 150,000 shares with the first annual vesting to occur 60 (sixty) days following the completion of the PUBCO M&A Transaction, as well as other routine terms.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Consulting Agreement or elsewhere, in no event would Thru Pharma be directly and/or indirectly obligated to enter into or complete any particular M&A Transaction, including, but not limited to, any M&A Transaction with the Company.

Effective July 1, 2015, Thru Pharma and Catalyst Funding, LLC, entered into an Original Issue Discount Revolving Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “Catalyst Note”) and a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Catalyst SPA”). The transaction is secured by a grant of security interest to 100% of the Company stock held by or for Thru Pharma. The Catalyst Note and Catalyst SPA are intended to facilitate funding essential work relating to multi-year auditing of Thru Pharma financials. The total available funds are $200,000, and Thru Pharma has only drawn $75,000. A Commitment Fee of Company stock in the amount of 35,294 shares was authorized for issue to Catalyst as part of the transaction.
 
On March 1, 2017, the Company’s majority shareholder, Thru Pharma LLC entered into a merger agreement with Kasten, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Kasten”), whereby Kasten was the surviving corporation. As part of the merger agreement, the shares in the Company held by Thru Pharma were withheld from the agreement and the Company was no longer identified as a subsidiary of Thru Pharma thereby effectively spinning out the Company and excluding it from the surviving entity.  Kasten has been identified as party to and co-guarantor of the Catalyst note.  The Company is in the process of settling the note with Catalyst whereby funds used to satisfy the note are being provided by its Chief Executive Officer, Steven J. Keough whereas Mr. Keough will be effectively purchasing the 8,000,000 common shares in the Company and the Arax Holdings Corp receivable (listed on the books of the Company as a related party payable in the amount of $152,562 for the year ended October 31, 2016) in exchange for extinguishing the note.  The 8,000,000 shares are currently collateralizing the Catalyst loan. Upon satisfaction of the note, the Company’s related party payable will be due to Mr. Keough, and he will become the majority shareholder in the Company.
 
The Company’s status as a “shell company” as of the date of this report remains unchanged.
