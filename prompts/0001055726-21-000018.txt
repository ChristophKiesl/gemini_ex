Company Overview
INOVIO is a biotechnology company focused on rapidly bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Our DNA medicines pipeline is comprised of three types of product candidates: DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies (dMAbs®). In clinical trials, we have demonstrated that DNA medicines can be delivered directly into cells in the body through our proprietary smart device to consistently activate robust and fully functional T cell and antibody responses against targeted pathogens and cancers. 
Our corporate strategy is to advance, protect and, once approved, commercialize our novel DNA medicines to meet urgent and emerging global health needs. We continue to advance and clinically validate an array of DNA medicine candidates that target HPV-associated diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). We aim to advance these candidates through commercialization and continue to leverage third-party resources through collaborations and partnerships, including product license agreements.
Our novel DNA medicine candidates are made using our proprietary SynCon® technology that uses a computer algorithm to identify and optimize the DNA sequence of the target antigen (proteins associated with a cancer or infectious disease that the body will recognize as foreign or not normal). INOVIO then creates optimized plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that instruct a cell to produce the target antigen to help the person’s immune system recognize and destroy cancerous or virally infected cells.
Our patented CELLECTRA® smart delivery devices provide optimized uptake, or absorption, of our DNA medicines within the cell, overcoming a key limitation of other DNA-based technology approaches. 
Human clinical trial data to date has shown a favorable safety profile of our DNA medicines in more than 7,000 administrations across more than 3,000 patients.
Specifically, our lead product candidate VGX-3100, currently in Phase 3 trials for precancerous cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), cleared high-risk HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in a Phase 2b clinical trial. Also in clinical development are programs targeting HPV-associated cancers and a rare HPV-associated disease, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP); non-HPV-associated cancers glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and prostate cancer; as well as externally funded infectious disease DNA vaccine development programs in Zika, Lassa fever, Ebola, HIV, and coronaviruses associated with MERS and COVID-19 diseases. 
For our COVID-19 vaccine program, INO-4800, we published Phase 1 clinical data from the first cohort of 40 participants in EClinicalMedicine, an open access clinical journal published by The Lancet, in December 2020. The paper, titled 
"Safety and immunogenicity of INO-4800 DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of an open-label, Phase 1 clinical trial," found that INO-4800 was immunogenic in all vaccinated subjects, effectively generating an immune response of humoral (including neutralizing antibodies) and/or cellular responses (both CD4 and CD8 T cells). Furthermore, the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg dose groups both demonstrated seroconversion in 95% of subjects, respectively, with 78% demonstrating neutralizing antibodies in the 1.0 mg dose group and 84% demonstrating neutralizing antibodies in the 2.0 mg dose group. Cellular (T cell) response were observed to multiple regions of the spike protein, including the receptor binding domain region. 74% had measurable cellular responses at the 1.0 mg dose group and 100% of the subjects in the 2.0 mg dose group demonstrated cellular responses.
We are currently conducting the Phase 2 segment of our planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial for INO-4800, called INNOVATE (INOVIO INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). INNOVATE is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trial of INO-4800 conducted in adults in the U.S. It is being funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA).
The DoD agreed to provide funding for both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 segments of the INNOVATE clinical trial, in addition to the $71.1 million of funding previously announced in June 2020 for the large-scale manufacture of the company's proprietary smart device, CELLECTRA® 3PSP, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA® 2000 devices.

Summary Risk Factors
Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the global COVID-19 pandemic.
•We have incurred significant losses in recent years, expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.
•We are currently subject to litigation and may become subject to additional litigation, which could harm our business, financial condition and reputation.
•Our planned clinical development of INO-4800 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine has been placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA, which may cause delays in the commencement of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial or completion of clinical testing, both of which could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to proceed to commercialization and generate revenues.
•There can be no assurance that the product we are developing for COVID-19 would be granted an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA or similar authorization by regulatory authorities outside of the United States if we were to decide to apply for such an authorization. If we do not apply for such an authorization or, if we do apply and no authorization is granted or, once granted, it is terminated, we will be unable to sell our product in the near future and instead, will be required to pursue the biologic licensure process in order to sell our product, which is lengthy and expensive.
•Delays in the commencement or completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay or limit our ability to generate revenues.
•None of our human vaccine candidates, including INO-4800, or our immunotherapy and DNA encoded monoclonal antibody product candidates have been approved for sale, and we may never develop commercially successful vaccine, immunotherapy or monoclonal antibody products.
•We will need substantial additional capital to develop our DNA vaccines, DNA immunotherapies and dMAb programs and electroporation delivery technology.
•If we lose or are unable to secure collaborators or partners, or if our collaborators or partners do not apply adequate resources to their relationships with us, our product development and potential for profitability will suffer. 
•A small number of licensing partners and government contracts account for a substantial portion of our revenue.
•We have agreements with government agencies, which are subject to termination and uncertain future funding. 
•We face intense and increasing competition and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and experience.
•If we and the contract manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce our electroporation devices and product candidates in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or at all, or fail to comply with their obligations to us or with stringent regulations, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of our electroporation equipment and product candidates.
•It is difficult and costly to generate and protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.
•If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our Differentiated DNA Medicines Platform 
Overview of Our Platform 
Our DNA medicines platform uses precisely designed DNA plasmids, which are circular strands of DNA that contain an optimized genetic sequence of an antigen (protein) or monoclonal antibody specific to a targeted disease to be produced inside a patient's own body. Our proprietary design and optimization process for our DNA plasmids is called SynCon®. These plasmids are delivered directly into cells in the body intramuscularly or intradermally via our proprietary CELLECTRA® smart devices, which use brief electrical pulses to reversibly open small pores in the cell, enabling DNA plasmids to enter. Once inside the cell, the plasmids instruct the body’s cellular machinery to temporarily produce the target antigen or monoclonal antibody. We believe our DNA medicines platform offers versatile capabilities, both in terms of addressing a number of disease targets as well as providing us with several product development opportunities. 
The characteristics and core components of our DNA medicines platform include: 
1. SynCon® Design Process: Our SynCon® optimized plasmids have shown the ability to help break the immune system’s tolerance of cancerous or infected cells and facilitate cross-strain protection against unmatched and matched pathogen variants. 
2. CELLECTRA® Smart Device: Once our DNA medicines are injected into the cells of the body using our proprietary smart device, the DNA plasmids instruct the cell to temporarily produce the target antigen or monoclonal antibody. The antigen is processed naturally in the cell and induces the immune system to generate antibodies and/or T cells that perform preventive or therapeutic functions. Similarly, dMAbs® generated in this manner can also trigger desired immune system functions.
3. Our DNA medicines have generated best-in-class in vivo (within the body) immune responses: With our core platform technology, we have developed a pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates that have generated best-in-class in vivo immune responses, in particular CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are fundamental in eliminating cancerous or infected cells. 
4. Our DNA medicines work naturally with the immune system: Compared to other technologies, our DNA medicines are designed to work more naturally with the immune system to reduce or minimize the risk of unwanted inflammatory responses. 
The mechanism of action for our DNA medicines and the process for administration of our DNA medicines are summarized in the following graphic:
Nucleic Acid Vaccines: Similarities and Differences between DNA and mRNA-based Approaches
The use of nucleic acid-based vectors (DNA or RNA) as an alternative to traditional immunization is a strategy that has been under development for many years. We believe that the approval for emergency use authorization of two mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19 in 2020 proves the power of nucleic acids, which are also core to DNA-based vaccines. 
DNA-based vaccines are composed of purified, closed-circular plasmid DNA containing genes that encode target antigens. Historical studies have shown the ability for DNA-based vaccines to generate immune responses against various pathogens in diverse animal species. Immunization with DNA-based plasmids has also been successfully attempted in several tissues by various routes of administration, with most experiments being conducted with DNA delivered to skeletal muscle or the skin. Past experimental studies involving nucleic acid vaccines targeted a broad range of infectious diseases which included leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis.
Over the past decade, the scientific community and the vaccine industry have been asked to respond urgently to various epidemics, including but not limited to: H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika and, most recently, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Today, multiple platforms are under development in the fight against COVID-19. Among those are DNA- and RNA-based platforms, along with those for developing viral vectors and recombinant-subunit vaccines. 
INOVIO’s efforts to develop a DNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19 is based on the suitability and scalability of our DNA medicines platform, as well as our track record of rapidly generating promising countermeasures against previous pandemic threats. INOVIO was the first company to advance a vaccine against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus, into clinical evaluation in humans. 
INOVIO’s DNA Medicines’ Differentiation from mRNA
While DNA and RNA both use fragments of genetic materials that, once injected, instruct the body to fight pathogens, cancer and infectious disease, there are unique advantages to DNA vaccines compared to RNA vaccines. While it has been demonstrated that DNA vaccines allow for the option of repeated administration, RNA vaccines specific nanolipidic formulation may impair re-administration, and, on balance, they have resulted in weaker CD8 T cell responses, require colder storage temperature than Antarctica for transportation, require complex lipid nano particle (LNP) formulations for scaling, and are on average more expensive when considering manufacturing and distribution. INOVIO’s DNA vaccines offer several key potential advantages:
a.Well-tolerated: Our DNA vaccines appear to be well-tolerated when evaluated against multiple disease targets.
b.Stability of Product: Our DNA vaccines are stable for more than a year at room temperature or for more than a month at 37º C, have a five-year projected shelf life at normal refrigeration temperature and do not require frozen cold storage or shipping.
c.Rapid Design and Manufacture: Similar to mRNA vaccines, our DNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and scaled, which are critical aspects in addressing global pandemics like COVID-19.
d.T Cell Responses: Our DNA vaccines have demonstrated ability to generate high levels of T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) responses along with antibody responses. The CD8+ T cell responses in particular are regarded to be very important in their ability to clear tumor cells in the body as well as to fight off infections. 
e.Ability to Safely Readminister DNA Vaccines: Our DNA vaccines have been used to boost our vaccines’ immunity profile with repeat administration with our DNA vaccines. Our DNA vaccines could be safely readministered if immunity weans, offering the possibility for seasonal boosting usage without any concerns of generating an anti-vector response.
Our DNA Medicines Platform in Detail: Delivery Science 
The goal of our DNA medicines platform is to generate and deliver safe and effective therapeutics and vaccines. Our technologies allows us to enable in vivo generation of functional immune responses to achieve desired therapeutic and preventive outcomes. Historically, we have focused primarily on in vivo production of disease-specific antigens directly in the body to stimulate prophylactic or therapeutic immune responses. More recently, we have explored an additional new application for the platform: in vivo generation of monoclonal antibodies to achieve preventive and therapeutic outcomes complementary to our antigen-generating immunotherapies. 
With these core technologies, we have developed a robust pipeline of 15 clinical-stage programs that have generated robust in vivo immune responses, in particular CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, which are fundamental in eliminating cancerous or infected cells.
There are two components to our DNA medicines platform. The first is a biological component, by which we encode proteins (antigens, monoclonal antibodies, interleukins i.e.IL-12) into closed-circular DNA plasmids. These DNA plasmids encode highly optimized antigens or transgene proteins that drive increased expression intracellularly while also driving immune responses. The second component is our proprietary CELLECTRA® smart devices technology, which facilitates delivery of the DNA plasmids.
The resulting immune responses from DNA medicine administration then neutralize or eliminate infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms, or abnormal cells, such as malignant tumor or infected cells. T cells can be immediately “trafficked” to parts of the body where cells are displaying the target antigen. Memory cells are also created for durable effects.
Our SynCon® DNA medicines are designed to generate antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses. First, we identify one or more antigens that we believe are the best targets, based on extensive due diligence, pre-clinical and clinical data that we have evaluated to direct the immune system toward a particular cancer or infectious disease. We then apply our SynCon® design process, which uses the genetic make-up of the selected antigens from multiple variants of a cancer or strains of a virus.
For each antigen, we create a new genetic sequence that represents a nucleotide consensus sequence of the targeted antigen from multiple virus variants or strains. We can create a differentiated SynCon® variant to help the immune system better recognize a cancer self-antigen (from a cancerous cell grown in the body) and “break the tolerance” of those cancer cells within the body. In human clinical trials, we have generated immune responses with SynCon® DNA medicines that were not matched to different strains of an infectious disease, such as influenza or HIV, indicating that such immunotherapies may have more universal protective capabilities against unmatched strains of a circulating virus. As a result, these SynCon® constructs may provide a solution to broadly cover the genetic “shift” and “drift” that is typical of many infectious diseases. Since the new engineered Syncon® sequence is closely similar to the originating sequences but does not match any, so we believe it is patentable. 
The SynCon® sequence is then inserted into a circular DNA plasmid with its own promoter. The plasmid is optimized at the DNA level for codon usage, improved stability of mRNA, and provided with enhanced and proprietary leader sequences for ribosome loading; it is optimized at the genetic level to enable high expression in human cells. We believe these design capabilities allow us to better target appropriate immune system mechanisms and produce a higher level of the coded antigen to enhance the overall ability of the immunotherapy to induce the desired immune response.
The plasmids are then manufactured in a bacterial fermentation process using scalable technology. These manufactured DNA medicines can be stable under normal environmental conditions for extended periods of time.
Our DNA medicines platform also allows for rapid design, pre-clinical testing, manufacturing at scale, and clinical development of both our DNA vaccine and DNA immunotherapy product candidates. Speed is an important feature, 
particularly as it relates to developing a response to globally emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Responses to emerging infectious diseases that we have been involved in are described in more detail below. 
CELLECTRA® Delivery Technology
Our DNA medicines are delivered directly into cells of the body intramuscularly or intradermally in a small local area of tissue using our proprietary CELLECTRA® smart devices. CELLECTRA® smart devices use brief electrical pulses to reversibly open small pores in the cell, enabling DNA plasmids to enter. Through this process, the cellular uptake of the DNA plasmids increases by more than 1,000 fold compared to the injection of a DNA plasmid alone without other delivery mechanisms. This improved cellular uptake has enabled the immune responses observed in our clinical trials along with the efficacy results generated by these immune responses.
Alternative delivery approaches based on the use of virus-based vectors, bacteria, nanoparticles and lipids are complex and expensive and have generated safety concerns. Because those alternative delivery vectors themselves possess many additional antigens specific to the vector, they can attract unwanted immune responses that are believed to compromise the vectors’ ability to deliver their genetic “payload” and produce the desired immune response. In contrast, a DNA plasmid vector possesses no antigens of its own, the plasmid results in production of only the target antigen.
We have published preclinical data in which we observed improved immune responses generated by our SynCon® DNA medicines delivered using CELLECTRA® smart devices compared to a leading viral vector-based approach (Adenovirus type 5). The delivery of DNA medicines using CELLECTRA® smart devices to date has shown a favorable safety profile in clinical trials, without serious adverse events and only transient and mild local injection-related side effects such as redness and swelling. Our delivery system based approach is designed to be tolerable without the need for an anesthetic, and because it does not induce side effects, it can be repeatedly administered for booster/maintenance vaccinations.
We believe our CELLECTRA® smart devices provide a straightforward, cost-effective method for delivering our DNA medicines into cells with high efficiency, minimal complications and the ability to enable what we believe to be clinically relevant levels of gene expression, immune responses, and efficacy.
Choice of Tissue for DNA Medicine Delivery
Skeletal muscle has been a core focus for delivery of DNA medicines via CELLECTRA® because it is mainly composed of large, elongated cells that are non short-term dividing, meaning that longer-term expression can be obtained without integration of the gene of interest into the genome. We have generated pre-clinical and clinical evidence that muscle cells may have a capacity for secretion of proteins into the bloodstream. Secreted therapeutic proteins may therefore act systemically and produce therapeutic effects in distant tissues of the body. In this respect, the muscle functions as a production factory for the biopharmaceutical needed by the body. We envision that CELLECTRA®-delivered DNA medicines to muscle cells will circumvent the costly and complicated production procedures of viral based delivery vectors, bacterial based delivery vectors, protein-based drugs, conventional vaccines and recombinant monoclonal antibodies. This approach may provide long-term stable expression of a therapeutic protein or monoclonal antibody at a sustained level.
In addition to generating pre-clinical and clinical evidence that intramuscular DNA delivery can be effective for a number of immunotherapies, we are also exploring delivery to the skin as an optimal route of administration for DNA vaccines. Skin, or intradermal, administration is an attractive site for immunization given its high density of antigen presenting cells. Unlike muscle, skin is the first line of defense against most pathogens and is therefore rich in immune cells and molecules that may generate a robust immune response. With intradermal delivery, we may be able to demonstrate a comparable cellular immune response to muscle delivery. 
Our CELLECTRA® Smart Delivery Systems
There are several configurations in the CELLECTRA® smart device family. The first configuration covers intramuscular (IM) delivery, while the second covers intradermal/subcutaneous delivery (ID). Smart devices with these configurations have been validated, manufactured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and are being used in human clinical trials. We have filed device master files with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) covering the use of the CELLECTRA® smart devices in human clinical trials. 
Our CELLECTRA®-SP smart devices combine the functionality of our current generation of skin and intramuscular devices in clinical testing with enhanced form, design and portability. All components of the pulse generator and applicator are integrated into a cordless, rechargeable device. The rechargeable battery can enable immunization of several hundred subjects, making the device useful for mass vaccinations. The devices are designed to accommodate different electrode arrays to meet the requirements of the particular DNA medicine and targeted tissue for delivery.
Next-Generation Smart Device Development
We are also advancing a new generation of ID delivery devices called CELLECTRA®-3P. Currently used ID devices penetrate no more than 3 mm into the target tissue, compared to IM devices that go deeper. All of our current vaccine clinical studies are using these CELLECTRA®-3P smart devices.
The medical arm of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has agreed to fund the further development of our commercial ID delivery device or CELLECTRA 3PSP®. DTRA provided $8.14 million of grant funding to support us in developing a small, portable, battery-powered ID device to be branded as CELLECTRA®-3PSP, which will be used in the administration of our vaccines and therapies, including DTRA-developed products. In addition to the development of CELLECTRA® _3PSP, this award will fund the investigation of DNA vaccines developed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) using the new device.
In June 2020, we were awarded $71.1 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to support the large-scale manufacture of the CELLECTRA® 3PSP smart device, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA® 2000 devices. The DoD contract, from the JPEO-CRBND-EB through funding provided by the Defense Health Program, builds upon two separate prior $5 million grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CEPI, to accelerate the testing of CELLECTRA® 3PSP.
Background on DNA Medicines and Immuno-Oncology 
Multiple technology advancements and product approvals have highlighted the potential of immunotherapies to usher in a new era of cancer therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as Herceptin® and dendritic cell therapy Provenge® for prostate cancer have had varying degrees of success. While a significant step forward, suitable monoclonal antibodies with desired characteristics have been difficult to design or identify and expensive to produce, and the technology does not lend itself to designing mAbs for many diseases. Dendritic, or other cell-based therapy, is a highly personalized medicine involving removing cells from the patient, modifying, multiplying, and then returning them to the body. In addition to the high-cost and complex processes to manufacture products, a weakness of this approach is that it has not been shown to generate high levels of cancer-specific T cells.
Progress in the field of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) has resulted in optimism regarding the potential for new immunotherapies against a spectrum of cancers. The immune system relies on a safeguard system of checkpoint mechanisms to prevent excessive or incorrectly directed immune responses. Many cancer cells can “hijack” these checkpoints and neutralize T cells sent by the immune system to eliminate them. CIs prevent cancer cells’ from interfering with these checkpoints and enable T cells (especially CD8+ killer T cells) to complete their killing function against cancer cells. Clinical trials of CIs have shown notable therapeutic impact against melanoma and other cancers, but with response rates in the 15-20% range (and only in the case of melanoma going up to the 40% range or higher), there remains a significant opportunity. Observations suggest CIs may be less effective if there is not a high enough pre-existing level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the tumor micro-environment, meaning that the tumor is “cold” rather than “hot” (with a significant level of CD8+ T cells). More recently, scientists have recognized that a strong CD8+ T cell generating “active” immunotherapy may be able to transform a "cold" tumor into a "hot" tumor and in combination with CIs may possess significant therapeutic potential to fight cancers.
More recently, a new category of immunotherapies called adoptive cell transfer, for example CAR-T technology, has provided further evidence of the merit of providing an enhanced T cell presence to fight cancer. CAR-T therapies have achieved dramatic results, most notably in B cell cancers. Unfortunately, they have also been associated with significant side effects. When this technology has been applied to solid tumors, it has generated significant cytokine storms that have resulted in severe side effects, including deaths. Moreover, adoptive cell transfer such as CAR-T, like dendritic cell therapy, involves removing T cells from a patient, modifying them to better target a cancer cell, multiplying the T cells, then returning them to the patient. These complex therapeutic products need to be manufactured and released for each patient, leading to expensive and timely manufacturing, as well as increased supply chain complexity.
To summarize, while there have been promising advancements in recent years that better harness or activate capable killer T cells, we believe there is still significant untapped potential to develop “ideal” immunotherapies to fight cancers and infectious diseases.
We seek to advance product candidates that:
•Target disease-specific antigens or proteins unique to a cancer or infectious disease;
•Do not depend on complex manufacturing processes;
•Activate functional killer T cells;
•Generate robust T cell responses or a significant number of T cells that are persistent and durable over time (memory response);
•Do not induce toxic inflammatory responses; and
•Are capable of “breaking tolerance” of cancer cells grown in the body.
Data from our Phase 2b data of VGX-3100, discussed below, lead us to believe our approach to activating significant antigen-targeted T cells may achieve these characteristics. Accordingly, we are advancing a pipeline of pre-clinical and clinical immunotherapy product candidates.
Our DNA Medicines in Development
 The chart below summarizes the status of our active DNA medicines development programs, each of which is described in more detail following the chart. 
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of HPV-associated Precancerous Lesions
Overview and Background
HPV is a sexually-transmitted, persistent infection with one or more high-risk (HR) genotypes of that virus can lead to, and thus are the causative agents responsible for, cervical pre-cancers (cervical dysplasia), cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers, and head & neck cancer, which is one of the most rapidly growing cancers in men. Scientific literature estimates that, at any given time, approximately 43% of the U.S. adult population is infected with HPV, and about 25% of adult men and 20% of adult women in the U.S. have a genital infection with one or more HR-HPV genotypes. Worldwide, the prevalence of cervical HPV infection in women overall (all ages combined) averages about 12%. However, this varies widely by age and geography -- in some regions of the world, e.g. Africa, the cervical HPV prevalence by age reaches about 45%. The lifetime risk for acquiring an HPV infection of any genotype is about 80% for people worldwide. In a recently published analysis, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 13 million new urogenital HPV infections occurred in year 2018 in persons aged 15 to 59 years alone in the United States., with about 42.5 million persons in that age group being HPV infected at any time during that year. That study also estimates that HPV comprised 50% of all incident infections and 63% of all prevalent sexually transmitted incident infections due to any agent. Nearly half of HPV infections are in the age group 15 to 24 years.
HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and is the major cause of cervical cancers. Almost 300 million women globally are estimated to be infected with HPV, with another 30 million additional cases that have progressed to the pre-cancerous stage. In the United States, an estimated 14,480 new cases of cervical cancer will occur in 2021, and an estimated 4,290 women will die of cervical cancer that year. Worldwide, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that more than 604,000 new cases of cervical cancer occurred in 2020 and nearly 342,000 deaths. IARC predicts that nearly 850,000 new cases of cervical cancer and more than 524,000 deaths will occur worldwide in 2040. Virtually all cases are linked with persistent infection with HPV.
Challenges with acceptance, accessibility and compliance of vaccines to prevent HPV infection and their resulting pre-cancers and cancers have been substantial since such vaccination availability began in 2006 in the U.S. These challenges have resulted in many vaccine-eligible girls and women remaining unvaccinated and at risk. In 2017, a U.S. national survey found that only 57% of girls aged 13-17 years were up to date with the HPV vaccine series. However, we believe such surveys yield overestimates. One recently published US national assessment found that only about 46% of females age 15 had been vaccinated with two or more doses of the HPV vaccine. Even lower proportions have been vaccinated in some of the other countries around the world which have access to HPV vaccines.
While approximately 90% of genital HPV infections in women are ultimately cleared naturally by the body's own immune system within three years of incident infection, persistent cervical infection with one or more HR-HPV genotypes can lead to cervical HSILs and, if untreated, eventually invasive cervical cancer. Researchers have estimated the global prevalence of clinically pre-cancerous cervical HSILs at between 28 and 40 million. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the two most prevalent high-risk types of HPV worldwide, causing the majority of HPV-associated cancers. In the United States, 43% of all cervical HSIL cases were attributable to HPV-16/18 in 2016, and about 70% of invasive cervical cancers are attributable to HPV-16/18 worldwide.
The estimated annual incidence of diagnosed cervical HSIL is up to 195,000 cases in the United States (including those uninsured, partially insured, and publicly insured) and approximately 263,000 to 503,000 cases in Europe. Patients with this condition represent a significant market opportunity for our product candidates. 
To prevent HPV infection and the precancers and cancers it causes, there is currently one FDA-approved preventive vaccine available in the United States, called Gardasil® 9. That vaccine protects against infection by nine total HPV genotypes, consisting of seven genotypes that confer high-risk for cancer and two that confer risk for RRP and genital warts. However, preventive HPV vaccines cannot treat or protect those already infected with the same HPV genotypes, which is a large population. Currently there is no viable immunotherapy or drug to fight incident, prevalent, or persistent HPV infection or treat cervical HSIL.
Current management options for cervical HSIL are unappealing. The “watch-and-wait” process associated with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, formerly called low-grade dysplasia or CIN 1) and in some young women with higher grade lesions (though only for the CIN 2 level of cervical HSIL) is a stressful approach. The only available treatment option for cervical HSIL is surgery, which involves ablating or cutting a women’s cervix to remove the pre-cancerous lesions. While surgical procedures are generally initially effective in removing lesions, they can lead to short-term adverse effects including cervical scarring, excess bleeding and infection, and to longer-term reproductive risks such as pre-term birth, miscarriage, and perhaps infertility. Current excisional and ablative procedures nearly double the overall risk of pre-term births from approximately 5% to 10%. Anticipation of these procedures produces significant anxiety for patients, despite their doctor’s reassurances, and full recovery from surgery can take up to several weeks. Because surgery does not clear the underlying HPV infection, there is a 10-16% chance of high-grade pre-cancer lesion recurrence after surgery as a result of persistent HPV infection and/or incomplete removal of the lesion, with the persistent HPV infection being the better predictor of recurrence.
Our therapeutic vaccine candidate VGX-3100 is designed to significantly increase T cell immune responses against the E6 and E7 oncogenic proteins of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 that are present in both precancerous and cancerous cells transformed by these HPV types. E6 and E7 are oncogenes that play an integral role in transforming HPV-infected cells into precancerous and cancerous cells, thus making them appealing targets for T cell directed immunotherapy. The goal of VGX-3100 is to stimulate the body's immune system to mount a T cell response strong enough to kill the cells producing the E6/E7 protein. The potential of such an immunotherapy would be to treat precancerous dysplasias caused by these HPV types.
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Cervical HSIL
Phase 2b Study Results
In 2015, we published clinical data from our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2b study of VGX-3100. We initiated this study in 2011 using our CELLECTRA® device in women with HPV type 16 or 18 and diagnosed with, but not yet treated for, cervical HSIL (also called high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3)).
Analyses of patient immune responses showed that overall antigen-specific T cell levels in women treated with VGX-3100 were greater than those treated by placebo at all observation periods. At week 14, levels of CD8+ T cells specific to the E6 and E7 HPV antigens in women treated with VGX-3100 were ten times greater than those in the placebo group. This response increased with each of the three immunizations, then declined modestly to a sustained and durable level of T cells (memory T cells) measured through 36 weeks (24 weeks post-treatment).
Patients whose lesions regressed had higher frequencies of HPV-specific CD8+ T cells which co-expressed key molecules important in the T cell killing cascade and directly correlated with clinical efficacy. Specifically, higher levels of CD8+ killer T cells co-expressing checkpoint molecule CD137 on their surface, as well as the cytolytic protein perforin, were observed to be a predictive tool for efficacy. As a strong activation marker for CD8+ T cells, stimulation through CD137 has been shown in some systems to confer resistance of CD8+ T cells to the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells, indicating that its presence can identify tumor reactive T cells. Perforin is a pore-forming protein deployed by killer T cells to bore holes into the target cell's plasma membrane and destroy the cell. The difference in frequencies of CD8+ T cells expressing CD137 and perforin was greatest in patients who had both regressed their lesions and cleared HPV as compared to patients who did not.
To our knowledge, this was the first published study from which a direct correlation between antigen-specific CD8+ T cells generated in vivo and clinical efficacy was observed. We have identified several potential key biomarkers of killer T cells 
that we believe can be used to predict the clinical efficacy of VGX-3100, as well as other immunotherapies, which we are seeking to confirm in our ongoing Phase 3 trial, described below.
Phase 2b Trial Design 
The women in the Phase 2b study received either 6 mg of VGX-3100 or a placebo. VGX-3100 and placebo were administered using the CELLECTRA® device at months 0, 1 and 3. The study assessed efficacy by measuring regression of cervical lesions from high-grade to low-grade or normal in the treated versus control subjects. Immunological responses were also measured in this clinical study to assess the ability of this therapy to generate strong T cell responses in a larger, controlled study. Safety was also assessed.
The primary endpoint of the trial, histologic regression, was evaluated 36 weeks after the first treatment. In the per protocol analysis of this three-immunization regimen, cervical HSIL resolved to LSIL or no disease in 53 of 107 (49.5%) women treated with VGX-3100, compared to 11 of 36 (30.6%) who received placebo. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.017). Intent to treat results were also similar and statistically significant.
There was also a high level of complete clearance of cervical HSIL when compared to that of a normal cervix. In a post-hoc analysis, cervical HSIL resolved to no disease in 43 of 107 (40.2%) women treated with VGX-3100, compared to 6 of 36 (16.7%) who received placebo (p=0.006).
A secondary endpoint of the trial was virological clearance of HPV 16 or 18 from the cervix in conjunction with histopathological regression of cervical HSIL to low-grade or no disease. This endpoint was achieved in 43 of 107 (40.2%) VGX-3100 recipients, compared to 5 of 35 (14.3%) placebo recipients (p=0.001). We believe this is an important outcome, as persistence of the HPV virus is associated with recurrence of cervical HSIL.
All Phase 2b patients were monitored for an additional 52 weeks for a safety follow up. No significant safety issues were observed through week 88 following treatment.
Phase 3 Trial (REVEAL)
In preparation for pivotal Phase 3 development and commercialization, we completed a manufacturing technology-transfer to a commercial manufacturing facility and scaled up manufacturing of VGX-3100.
We also designed and manufactured a new smart delivery device, CELLECTRA®-5PSP, which is being used in our global Phase 3 clinical trial of VGX-3100. This smart device is a fully automated, smaller and user-friendly hand-held device. The new CELLECTRA®-5PSP smart device is being used in our ongoing VGX-3100 Phase 3 trial, which started in June 2017, and is being developed for potential commercial use.
We have conducted additional market research with physicians and patients to better understand the unmet medical needs relating to cervical HSIL. These include a preference for a non-invasive, non-surgical procedure for removing cervical lesions; a treatment that can clear HPV, the cause of the pre-cancer, throughout the body and not just in the limited area of the lesion; and a treatment that does not result in pre-term births or infertility. We believe that cervical HSIL represents a unique market opportunity for a novel therapy capable of providing a first-line alternative to surgery and in some cases even an alternative to watchful waiting. This market research will help guide our communication and interaction with the physician, patient and support communities.
Our Phase 3 program, named REVEAL, consists of a primary study (REVEAL 1) and confirmatory study (REVEAL 2), being conducted in parallel. The REVEAL1 study enrolled 201 subjects while enrollment of REVEAL 2 is ongoing.
The REVEAL studies are prospective, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating adult women with HPV 16/18 positive biopsy-proven cervical HSIL (CIN 2/3). The primary endpoint is regression of cervical HSIL and virologic clearance of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 in the cervix, which was a secondary endpoint that was achieved in our Phase 2b trial described above. Overall, the Phase 3 studies are evaluating cervical tissue changes at approximately 9 months after beginning a three-dose regimen of VGX-3100 administered at months 0, 1 and 3. 
In May 2019, VGX-3100 was granted an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product Certificate by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for quality and non-clinical data. The procedure of certification of quality and non-clinical data involves an assessment of the available data in view of future registration and the related European Scientific Data Requirements, not including any clinical data or benefit-risk assessment. The granted EMA's certificate confirms that our chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) data and nonclinical results available to date overall comply with the scientific and technical standards for evaluating an EU Marketing Authorization.
In March 2021, we announced that VGX-3100 had achieved the primary and secondary endpoints among all evaluable subjects (modified intention to treat (mITT) population) for the REVEAL 1 trial. The trial protocol-defined mITT population (N=193) includes all subjects with endpoint data. For the primary endpoint of histopathological regression of HSIL combined with virologic clearance of HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at week 36, the percentage of responders was 23.7% (31/131) in the treatment group, versus 11.3% (7/62) in the placebo group (p=0.022; 95%CI: 0.4,22.5), thus achieving statistical significance. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints were achieved. These endpoints were: a) regression of cervical HSIL to normal tissue combined with HPV16/18 viral clearance, b) regression of cervical HSIL alone, c) regression of cervical HSIL to normal tissue, and d) HPV 16/18 viral clearance alone. 
The trial protocol-defined intention to treat (ITT) population (N=201) includes all randomized subjects regardless of availability of endpoint data, and defines those without endpoint data as non-responders. There were eight such subjects (seven in the treatment group, one in the placebo group). Including subjects with missing endpoint data, the percentage of subjects meeting the primary endpoint was 22.5% (31/138) in the treatment group, versus 11.1% (7/63) in the placebo group (p=0.029; 95%CI: -0.4,21.2), which was not statistically significant. All secondary endpoints were achieved except for regression of cervical HSIL alone (95%CI: -0.6,24.5). The reasons for missing endpoint data were: one subject was randomized but was never dosed, one withdrawal due to pregnancy, one withdrawal due to administration error, one withdrawal due to post-administration pain, one loss of follow-up due to COVID19-related travel restrictions, and three losses to follow up due to undetermined reasons. A pre-specified per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be performed upon trial completion.
There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and most adverse events were self-resolving and were considered to be mild to moderate, consistent with earlier clinical trials.
We will continue to follow subjects in the REVEAL1 trial for safety and durability of response for 18 months following the last administration. We expect to present full data from REVEAL 1 at an upcoming scientific meeting.
Enrollment for the confirmatory REVEAL 2 trial is ongoing.
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Vulvar HSIL
Precancerous lesions of the vulva, or vulvar HSIL, has less than a 5% rate of spontaneous or natural regression and there are no FDA-approved non-surgical treatments. Surgery, the most common treatment, is associated with high rates of disease recurrence and can cause disfigurement, long-term pain, and psychological distress for the women who undergo the procedure. Vulvar HSIL recurs in approximately one of every two patients who undergo surgical treatment.
In April 2017, we commenced an open label Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of VGX-3100 in patients with vulvar HSIL. This randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial will assess the efficacy of VGX-3100 in 33 women with vulvar HSIL. VGX-3100 is administered with our CELLECTRA® intramuscular delivery smart device. The primary endpoint of the study is histologic clearance of high-grade lesions and virologic clearance of the HPV virus in vulvar tissue samples. The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of VGX-3100.
In January 2021, we announced positive efficacy results for the Phase 2 trial. A 25% or more reduction in HPV-16/18-associated vulvar HSIL was observed for 63% of trial participants (12 of 19) treated with VGX-3100 at six months post-treatment. Three out of the 20 participants with histology data (15%) resolved their vulvar HSIL and had no HPV-16/18 virus detectable in the healed area. By comparison, the spontaneous resolution of vulvar HSIL caused by HPV-16/18 is estimated to be only 2%. VGX-3100 was well-tolerated in the Phase 2 trial.
We plan to pursue a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for HPV-16/18-associated vulvar dysplasia as well as to apply for rare and orphan disease designation for this indication.
VGX-3100 for the Treatment of Anal or Perianal HSIL
Left untreated, anal HSIL may progress to cancer. Spontaneous regression of anal HSIL may occur, but only in the range of 20% to 29% of patients after one year of follow-up. Persistent infection with a high-risk HPV genotype is responsible for a large portion of anal cancer. In the United States, about 55% to 80% of anal HSIL cases are associated with HPV-16/18, and worldwide about 80% of anal HSIL cases are associated with HPV-16/18. In the United States, over 90% of anal cancer is attributable to HPV, and about 87% of those HPV anal cancers are attributable to HPV-16/18 specifically.
There are no validated screening tests or a general screening recommendation consensus for anal HSIL. Treatment usually consists of repeated ablation, most commonly radiofrequency ablation (RFA), resections or laser therapy. However, treatment of anal HSIL represents a significant unmet medical need due primarily to the high recurrence rates up to 49% one year after treatment.
In May 2018, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate VGX-3100 in patients who are HIV-negative with histologically confirmed anal or perianal HSIL, or anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. The open-label trial enrolled 24 patients who received 3 doses of VGX-3100 delivered by our intramuscular CELLECTRA® device. The primary endpoint of the study was histologic clearance of the high-grade lesions and virologic clearance of the HPV-16/18 virus in anal/perianal tissue samples.
In August 2018, in partnership with the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC), we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate VGX-3100 in patients who are HIV-positive with histologically confirmed anal or perianal HSIL associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. The open-label single-arm trial will enroll approximately 75 patients who will receive 4 doses of 
VGX-3100 delivered by our intramuscular CELLECTRA® smart device. The primary endpoint of the study was histological regression of high-grade anal lesions to low-grade or normal. The trial was fully funded by AMC.
In December 2020, we announced positive Phase 2 efficacy results demonstrating that VGX-3100 showed resolution of HPV-16/18-associated precancerous anal lesions (HSIL) in 50% (11 of 22) of subjects six months following the start of treatment. VGX-3100 was well-tolerated in this trial
INOVIO plans to pursue a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for HPV-16-/18-associated anal dysplasia as well as to apply for rare and orphan disease designation for this indication.
VGX-3100 Immune Correlates and Biomarker Signatures
In November 2017, we announced that a post-hoc analysis of data generated from our Phase 2b trial of VGX-3100 identified immune correlates and biomarker signatures that were predictive of potential treatment success. Details of the new biomarker and immunologic data are highlighted in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Cancer Research in the article, “Clinical and Immunologic Biomarkers for Histologic Regression of High-grade Cervical Dysplasia and Clearance of HPV-16 and HPV-18 after Immunotherapy,” by us and our academic collaborators.
In May 2019, we entered into a collaboration with QIAGEN N.V. to co-develop a liquid biopsy-based companion diagnostic for the related immune correlates and biomarker signatures to identify patients most likely to respond to VGX-3100.
In February 2021, we announced an extension of our partnership with QIAGEN with a new master collaboration agreement to develop liquid biopsy-based companion* diagnostic products based on next-generation sequencing technology to complement INOVIO’s therapies. 
The initial project in this expanded collaboration focuses on the co-development of a diagnostic test that identifies women who are most likely to benefit from clinical use of VGX-3100. QIAGEN’s bioinformatic expertise will further increase the predictive power of INOVIO’s preliminary biomarker signature – and the assay will now be developed for use on the Illumina NextSeq™ 550Dx platform, the first development based on a partnership QIAGEN and Illumina signed in October 2019.
ApolloBio Collaboration Agreement for VGX-3100 within Greater China
In December 2017, we entered into an amended agreement providing ApolloBio Corporation with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize VGX-3100 within Greater China (defined as China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan). Additional details on the ApolloBio Agreement are provided below under "Business-License, Collaboration and Supply Agreements." 
Upon the closing of the transaction in March 2018, we received proceeds of $19.4 million which comprised the upfront payment of $23.0 million less $2.2 million in foreign income taxes and $1.4 million in certain foreign non-income taxes. We may also receive potential milestone payments of up to $20 million in the aggregate. In addition, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalty payments on sales. This collaboration of VGX-3100 encompasses the treatment and/or prevention of precancerous HPV infections and HPV-driven dysplasias (including cervical, vulvar and anal precancers) and excludes HPV-driven cancers and all combinations of VGX-3100 with other immunostimulants. The agreement also provides for potential inclusion of the Republic of Korea during the first three years of the term of the agreement.
INO-3107 for the Treatment of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)
RRP is a rare disease (estimated at 15,000 active cases in the United States, including both juvenile and adult cases) that is characterized by the growth of tumors in the respiratory tract primarily caused by HPV-6 and/or HPV-11 genotypes. Although limited, the published epidemiologic data on RRP suggest this disease occurs worldwide. Although benign, papillomas can cause severe, sometimes life-threatening airway obstruction and respiratory complications. A distinguishing aspect of this disease is the tendency for the papilloma to recur after surgical procedures to remove them. If RRP develops in the lungs, affected individuals can potentially experience recurrent pneumonia, chronic lung disease (bronchiectasis) and, ultimately, progressive pulmonary failure. In extremely rare cases (less than 1%), RRP can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. Additional symptoms of RRP can include hoarse voice, difficulty in sleeping and swallowing, and chronic coughing. RRP symptoms are usually more severe in children than in adults. In children, the disorder is most often diagnosed at or around the age of four years. In adults, the disorder occurs most often in the third or fourth decade, though evidence exists for some incidence of new diagnoses in the sixth decade.
In February 2020, we announced the publication of clinical data from a pilot clinical study of a DNA medicine candidate (INO-3107) targeting HPV 6-associated RRP in the scientific journal Vaccines (MDPI). Study results demonstrated that the candidate generated immunogenicity and engagement and expansion of an HPV 6-specific cellular response, including cytotoxic T cells. Two out of two patients receiving treatment who previously required approximately two surgeries per year for several years to manage this disease delayed their need for surgery, with one patient able to delay surgery for over a year and a half (584 days surgery-free) and the second remaining surgery-free for over two and a half years (915 days surgery-free).
In February 2020, we commenced an open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 trial that plans to enroll up to approximately 63 subjects in the United States and will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-3107 in subjects 
with HPV-6 and/or HPV-11-associated RRP who have required at least two surgical interventions per year for the past three years for the removal of associated papilloma(s). For this study, adult subjects will first undergo surgical removal of their papilloma(s) and then receive four doses of INO-3107, one every three weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint will be a doubling or more in the time between surgical interventions following the first dose of INO-3107 relative to the frequency prior to study therapy. If we obtain sufficient safety and potential efficacy data in adults, we plan to expand the trial to include pediatric patients as well as a potential booster regimen. 
In July 2020, we announced that the FDA granted orphan drug designation for INO-3107. Orphan drug designation is intended to advance drug development for rare diseases. FDA grants orphan drug status to medicines intended for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, an orphan disease is defined as a disease or condition with a prevalence of less than 200,000 patients in the United States annually. This orphan drug designation from the FDA qualifies INO-3107 for various development incentives, including a tax credit on expenditures incurred in clinical studies, a waiver of the New Drug Application (NDA) fee, research grant awarded by the FDA, and potentially up to seven years of U.S. market exclusivity upon approval for the treatment of RRP.
In November 2020, we announced the dosing of the first subject with INO-3107 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of RRP. Patient recruitment is ongoing.
MEDI0457 (VGX-3100 + INO-9012) for the Treatment of HPV-Associated Cancers
Overview and Background
HPV is also associated with some head and neck cancers, especially those in the oropharynx and perhaps to some extent the larynx and oral cavity. The incidence of HPV-caused oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) has increased significantly within the last 30 years in the United States, including a 225% increase from 1988 to 2004, an average annual increase of 14%. More recently, from 1999 to 2015, HPV-associated OPSCC incidence in the United States increased among men at an annual average rate of 2.7% and among women at an annual average rate of 0.8%, and by approximately 2009 the incidence of these HPV-associated mouth and throat cancers in men exceeded that of cervical cancers in women. Oropharyngeal cancer is the fastest-rising cancer among young white men in the United States, and U.S. men in general are about four times more likely than women to be diagnosed with HPV-associated oropharynx cancer. Increasing trends of the cancer in the United States are projected to continue at least through the year 2030. The estimated U.S. prevalence of HPV-caused oral cavity and pharynx cancer was approximately 108,000 cases in 2015.
OPSCC is the most common HPV-attributable cancer in the United States. An estimated 14,000 new cases were diagnosed annually from 2013 to 2017 on average, with about 75% of those cases being among men. Worldwide, an estimated 98,412 new cases of oropharyngeal cancer overall occurred in 2020, and about 21% of those cases per year of this cancer are HPV- attributable.
Scientists have estimated that by 2030 OPSCC will constitute the majority of all head & neck cancers. In the U.S., about 70% of cancers of the oropharynx are now caused by HPV, with HPV-16 being the most prevalent genotype and causing about 86% of those HPV-caused cancers. The U.S. incidence rate of this cancer is projected to continue its exponential growth and reach 31,000 new annual cases by 2029.
Improvements in primary treatment modalities (surgery and radiation) have produced significant improvements in morbidity, but intensive radiation has a profound long-term impact on mortality and quality of life. Based on these factors, we believe there is a significant opportunity for an effective immunotherapy.
Considering the several known cancers caused by HPV, the relative and total burden of those in terms of the annual U.S. average annual incidence rates and portions attributable to the HPV-16/18 genotypes for the period from 2013 to 2017 (the latest time period for which such HPV association and attribution data are available) are shown in the following figure. In total for that period, an average of nearly 36,000 cases of HPV-attributable cancers per year were diagnosed in the United States, and 80% of those per year were specifically due to HPV-16/18 genotypes.
Annual Incidence of HPV-Attributable Invasive Cancers by Site in the United States, 2013 - 2017
Worldwide data estimates of the HPV-attributable fractions of HPV-associated cancers are shown in the following table.

MEDI0457 for the Treatment of Head & Neck Cancer
In 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the immunogenicity and safety of our product candidate INO-3112 (consisting of a combination of VGX-3100 and our product candidate INO-9012) in head & neck cancer patients. INO-3112 is now called MEDI0457, following our collaboration with AstraZeneca, described below. We added INO-9012, a DNA-based IL-12 immune activator, to VGX-3100 for this cancer study because our prior HIV vaccine clinical study had indicated that the addition of IL-12 to our DNA medicine could enhance the activation of CD8+ T cells.
We enrolled 22 adults with HPV16 and/or HPV18-positive HNSCC in this open-label Phase 1 trial. Patients were treated with four doses of MEDI0457 and then followed for safety, immune and clinical responses. In one part of the study, six patients were treated once with MEDI0457 before and after resection of their tumor. These patients received three additional doses subsequent to surgery and chemoradiation therapies. In the second part of the study, 16 patients were recruited into the study after their surgery and completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These patients were treated with four doses of MEDI0457 and followed. Each MEDI0457 treatment was administered using our CELLECTRA® smart delivery system.
In 2016, at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), we reported interim immunology results showing that in the group of six patients treated before resection (one dose averaging 14 days and ranging 7 to 28 days prior to definitive surgery) and post-surgery (three additional doses), MEDI0457 generated robust HPV16/18 specific CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood in four of five subjects who also showed increased T cell activation in resected tumor tissue samples. One subject withdrew consent after surgery, leaving five evaluable subjects in this group.
In October 2018, we announced a paper published in Clinical Cancer Research, a major cancer journal, detailing results of a patient with head and neck cancer treated with MEDI0457 who achieved a sustained complete response (full remission) on treatment with a subsequent PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. In our sponsored study of 22 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma we reported 91% (20/22) showed T cell activity in the blood or tissue.
In January 2019, we announced that a second patient with HPV-associated head and neck cancer treated with MEDI0457 in the Phase 1 trial achieved a sustained complete response (full remission) after subsequent treatment with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.
Both patients who achieved full cancer remission were treated with four doses of MEDI0457. This response indicates that MEDI0457 generated robust HPV-16/18 specific CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in resected tumor tissue samples.
Of the four patients who developed progressive disease and were subsequently administered a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, two patients rapidly exhibited a complete response. The most recent patient for which data was presented in January 2019 received pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), while the previously reported complete responder was treated with nivolumab (OPDIVO®). The patients moved from metastatic head and neck cancer to no evidence of disease and they remain alive two years after treatment.
Increasing evidence suggests that response rates from checkpoint inhibitors can be enhanced when used in combination with cancer vaccines like MEDI0457 that generate tumor-specific T cells. Interim data from a MEDI0457 monotherapy study of head and neck cancer patients demonstrated that MEDI0457 generated robust HPV-16/18 specific CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in resected tumor tissue samples.
Collaboration with AstraZeneca
In 2015, we formed a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca focused on cancer immunotherapies. Under this agreement AstraZeneca licensed INO-3112 (renamed MEDI0457), to be studied in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its pipeline in HPV-associated cancers. See “Business- License, Collaboration and Supply Agreements” for additional information about the collaboration agreement.
In 2017, we announced that AstraZeneca will conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial investigating the combination of MEDI0457 and durvalumab, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. The combination trial will enroll patients with metastatic HPV-associated HNSCC with persistent or recurrent disease after chemotherapy treatment.
The open-label clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy in 35 subjects with metastatic head and neck cancer at multiple U.S. sites. Subjects will receive multiple doses of MEDI0457 and durvalumab. The primary endpoints of the trial are safety and objective response rate. The trial will also evaluate immunological impact, progression-free survival and overall survival. The Phase 2 portion of this study was initiated in December 2017, and this initiation triggered a $7 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca to us.
In December 2018, we announced the dosing of the first patient in an open-label, Phase 2 combination trial to evaluate MEDI0457, in combination with durvalumab, in patients with HPV-associated cervical, anal, penile and vulvar cancers. This trial, which is being funded by AstraZeneca, has an estimated total enrollment of 77 patients.
The first dosing of a cervical cancer patient in this trial resulted in an additional $2.0 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca to us in 2018. A first dosing of a patient with a third distinct HPV-associated cancers other than H&N or cervical triggered another $2.0 million milestone payment in April 2019.
Under our collaboration agreement, AstraZeneca will fund all of the costs of developing MEDI0457.
INO-5151 (INO-5150 + INO-9012) for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer
In the United States in 2021, there will be an estimated 248,530 new cases of prostate cancer and more than 34,000 deaths due to this cancer. Worldwide in 2020, an estimated 1.41 million new cases of and nearly 375,000 deaths occurred due to this cancer. IARC projects that in year 2040, about 2.24 million new cases will occur.
In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate our DNA immunotherapy for prostate cancer, INO-5150, in men with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer. This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-5150 alone or in combination with INO-9012 (DNA vector expressing interleukin 12). The multi-centered study is also evaluating changes in prostate specific antigen, or PSA, levels, an important biomarker in prostate cancer. We have fully enrolled 62 patients in the trial across four dose cohorts.
An interim data analysis presented in 2017 at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting in Madrid, Spain showed that INO-5150 had generated antigen-specific CD8+ killer T cell responses measured in peripheral blood from subjects with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Treatment with INO-5150 as a monotherapy generated PSA and prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, specific T cell responses in peripheral blood in 60% (35/58) of the subjects. Patients with specific CD8+ T cell responses experienced dampening in the rise of PSA and significant increases in Prostate Specfic Antigen Doubling Times (PSADT).
In June 2018, additional prostate cancer data from the trial was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The additional data showed clinically meaningful PSA stabilization after administration of INO-5150 in patients, with no documented disease progression during the study. Of note, this effect was also observed in the patients with the fastest PSADT at the time of study entry.
In October 2018, we announced new data from the trial in which a slowing of PSADT was observed in men with prostate cancer. Eighty-six percent (86%) of patients remained progression-free at Week 72 of the study, and immunogenicity was observed in 77% (47/61) of patients by multiple immunologic assessments. These data were presented at the 2018 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress.
In July 2019, we announced a clinical collaboration agreement with Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) and the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) in which INO-5151 will be combined with an immune modulator (CDX-301, FLT3 ligand, a dendritic cell mobilizer) and a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) targeting metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in a PICI sponsored platform study. INO-5151 is a combined formulation of INO-5150 (with SynCon® antigens encoding for PSA and PSMA) and INO-9012.
This combination trial is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory platform study designed to assess the safety and antitumor activity of multiple immunotherapy based combinations in participants with mCRPC who have received prior secondary androgen inhibition. This study will evaluate biomarkers of immune activity and clinical outcomes using a multi-omic, multi-parameter approach. Our immunotherapy is one arm (Cohort C) of this broad PICI-supported study, which is a multi-arm, multi-stage platform design.
Under the agreement, PICI will design and execute the clinical study, working in collaboration with its established network of the most pre-eminent clinical academic and industry cancer centers, and with funding support from CRI. Based on PICI's novel approach to accelerating studies of cancer immunotherapies, we will provide financial contributions based on the actual costs of the study, if our product(s) studied under the collaboration reaches the initiation of a Phase 3 study.
The clinical trial is currently enrolling.
INO-5401 for the Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of brain cancer. The median age at diagnosis is 65 years, and the incidence rate increases with age to the maximum being in the group age 75-84 years. Its prognosis is extremely poor, despite a limited number of new therapies approved over the last 10 years. From 2013 to 2017 the median overall survival for patients receiving standard of care therapy was approximately 8 months and the five-year survival was 7.2%. 3-year survival has recently been estimated to be 10.5% from data of the 2004 to 2013 period.
In the United States, a recently published analysis of data from the 2013 – 2017 period found an estimated annual GBM incidence of 12,000 cases and projected incidence of 12,800 cases for the year 2020 and nearly 13,000 cases for the year 2021. 
Our product candidate INO-5401 is an immunotherapy consisting of three tumor-associated antigens: hTERT, Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) and PSMA. The National Cancer Institute previously highlighted WT1, hTERT and PSMA among a list of attractive cancer antigens, designating them as high priorities for cancer immunotherapy development. WT1 was at the top of the list. The hTERT antigen relates to 85% of cancers and WT1 and PSMA antigens are also widely prevalent in many cancers.
In 2017, we reported data indicating that our SynCon® WT1 cancer antigen was capable of breaking immune tolerance, a major challenge to researchers striving to develop potent cancer therapies, and induced neo-antigen-like T cell responses to cause tumor regression in pre-clinical studies. The results were published in the scientific journal Molecular Therapy.
While mice in the preclinical study did not mount an immune response to native mouse WT1 antigens, mice immunized with our SynCon® WT1 antigen broke tolerance and generated robust neo-antigen-like T cells. The immunized mice also exhibited smaller tumors and prolonged survival in a tumor challenge study. SynCon® WT1 DNA vaccination also broke tolerance and generated neo-antigen-like T cell immune responses in Rhesus monkeys, a species whose immune system closely resembles that of humans. The ability to overcome the immune system’s usual tolerance of WT1 antigen suggests the potential of our SynCon® WT1 antigen to tackle any WT1-expressing cancer in humans, including pancreatic, brain, lung, thyroid, breast, testicular, ovarian, and melanoma.
We previously reported similar results for our SynCon® hTERT and PSMA cancer antigens.
These attributes of breaking tolerance and having broader prevalence across different cancers create the potential for INO-5401 to be an effective universal cancer immunotherapy in combination with different checkpoint inhibitors.
In June 2018, we dosed the first patient as part of a Phase 1/2 immuno-oncology trial in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The trial is designed to evaluate INO-5401 and INO-9012, in combination with cemiplimab (Libtayo®), a PD-1 inhibitor developed jointly by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi.
The open-label Phase 2 trial of 50 newly diagnosed GBM patients is being conducted at approximately 25 U.S. sites, and the primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. The study will also evaluate immunological impact, progression-free survival and overall survival.
In November 2019, we provided interim results from the Phase 2 study. Key interim data from the 52-patient clinical trial showed that 80% (16 of 20) of MGMT gene promoter methylated patients and 75% (24 of 32) of unmethylated patients were progression-free at six months (PFS6) measured from the time of their first dose, substantially exceeding historical standard-of-care data. 
This immunotherapy combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor also exhibited supportive safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data and suggested a safety profile consistent with that of Libtayo® as well as our other product candidates. Most patients tested had a T cell immune response to one or more tumor-associated antigens encoded by INO-5401. Immune responses to all three tumor-associated antigens were demonstrated in this study.
In May 2020, we announced that 85% (44 out of 52) of the patients in the Phase 1/2 trial were alive for at least 12 months or more following treatment. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrated that 84.4% percent (27 of 32) of patients with MGMT promoter unmethylated tumors, and 85% (17 of 20) of patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors were alive at 12 months. Activated, killer T cells directed towards all three cancer antigens in INO-5401 were detected in all patients tested to 
date. INO-5401 + INO-9012 was well-tolerated when given not only with radiation and temozolomide, but also with PD-1 inhibition with Libtayo.
In November 2020, additional data from the Phase 1/2 study were presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) 2020 Annual Meeting. Survival data at 18 months showed that 70% (14/20) of MGMT promoter methylated GBM patients were alive, and 50% (16/32) of MGMT promoter unmethylated patients, which are the more difficult to treat group, were alive after 18 months. Median overall survival in the unmethylated GBM patients was 17.9 months, which compares favorably to historical controls. Median overall survival for methylated patients has not yet been reached and the study is ongoing.
Interim data demonstrated that in the MGMT promoter unmethylated cohort, 19/22 (86%) subjects had an IFN-gamma T cell response that increased over baseline to one or more of the antigens encoded by INO-5401. In the MGMT promoter methylated cohort, 16/17 (94%) subjects had an IFN-gamma response that increased over baseline to one or more of the antigens encoded by INO-5401. 
Infectious Disease Product Candidates
Our product development platform also allows for rapid design, pre-clinical testing, manufacturing and clinical development of our vaccine and immunotherapy product candidates. In 2016, we were the first entity able to advance a Zika vaccine into human clinical trials, just 4.5 months after the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the emerging Zika infections to be a Pandemic Health Emergency of International Concern. Previously, we led the development of the first MERS vaccine in human clinical trials. More recently, our DNA medicines platform and SynCon® sequencing capabilities allowed us to rapidly respond to the coronavirus outbreak of 2020. We believe that our development platform is well positioned to support global health agencies in order to develop preparedness countermeasures against bioterrorism and/or emerging pandemic agents.
INO-4800 for COVID-19 
Background on COVID-19
A novel strain of coronavirus emerged in the human population in Wuhan City, China in November-December 2019. On December 31, 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) China Office was informed of a number of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology appearing in the previous few days in Wuhan, China. On January 8, 2020, Chinese scientists announced the identification of a new Coronavirus associated with this pneumonia outbreak, and on January 11, they publicly shared the genetic sequence of that new virus. The new virus was temporarily referred to as “2019-nCoV” and “2019 novel coronavirus,” among other names, but subsequently was named SARS-CoV-2 due to the large similarity of its genetic sequence with that of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV). The new virus is a member of the genus of Coronaviruses, which is comprised of seven known viruses that can infect and make humans ill, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This novel coronavirus is part of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that include the high risk viruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and four other lower risk coronaviruses which can cause the common cold. The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus was subsequently named “COVID-19”. 
During this emergence, on January 30, 2020 the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and on March 11, 2020 the WHO declared this to be a pandemic. In the continued evolution of the pandemic since then, it has become clear that this is already one of the worst pandemics in recorded history, using the metric of the absolute number of caused deaths. 
The virus quickly spread throughout China, Asia, and worldwide. As of February 2021, every country on earth has reported confirmed cases. A total of more than 100 million confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with a total of nearly 2,300,000 reported deaths due to this disease, although the actual number of cases is far higher than the reported number.
The case-fatality ratio (aka case-fatality rate) for COVID-19 in the U.S. to date is about 0.60% in the United States, which is significantly lower than that of SARS (10%) and MERS (about 34%) but significantly higher than for seasonal influenza (0.1%). Estimates of the reproductive number (R0), or the average number of persons one infected person in turn infects, of SARS-CoV-2 in populations largely before significant community, travel, and business restrictions (aka “lockdowns”) were implemented ranged from 2.2 to somewhat above 4.0, with an average of about 3.8. The R0 for this novel coronavirus then appeared to be significantly higher than that of MERS-CoV (< 1.0) and the original SARS-CoV (about 2.0). It is the combination of the significant R0, the significant case-fatality ratio, and the primary airborne transmission route of this respiratory disease that led to this new coronavirus and disease to become one of the most serious pandemics in modern history. Presently, several major variants of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved and spread significantly from several portions of the globe and quickly to many countries. Each of these major variants have the characteristics of at least having a significantly increased transmission rate with respect to the original/main SARS-CoV-2 strain. However, some also have or appear to be likely developing significantly diminished susceptibility to one or more of the emergency-use authorized vaccines. Further, evidence is emerging that at least one of the variants has possibly increased pathogenicity as measured by case-fatality.
Preclinical Development
In January 2020, CEPI awarded us a grant of up to $9 million to develop a vaccine against COVID-19. Our candidate, INO-4800 targets the major surface antigen Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19 disease.
In May 2020, we announced the publication of preclinical study data demonstrating robust neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses against coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.
 In the preclinical studies, INO-4800 demonstrated virus neutralizing activity using three separate neutralization assays testing the vaccine's ability to generate antibodies which can block virus infection by: 1) an assay using live SARS-CoV-2 viruses; 2) an assay using a pseudo-virus assay, where another virus displays the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein; and, 3) a novel high-throughput surrogate neutralization assay measuring the ability of INO-4800-induced antibodies to block SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding to the host ACE2 receptor. Researchers also detected these antibodies in the lungs of the vaccinated animals which could be important in providing protection from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, high levels of Spike-specific T cell responses were observed with INO-4800 vaccination, which could be important in mediating protection from the virus infection. 
In July 2020, we announced that INO-4800 was effective in protecting non-human primates (NHPs), specifically rhesus macaques, from live virus challenge 13 weeks after the last vaccination. These protective results were mediated by memory T and B cell immune responses from INO-4800 vaccination.
In these studies, INO-4800 reduced viral load in both the lower lungs and nasal passages in macaques that received two doses of INO-4800 (1 mg) four weeks apart and then were challenged with live virus 13 weeks after the second dose (study week 17). The reduced viral loads following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection at this timeframe demonstrated an important durable impact mediated by INO-4800. This is the first time a vaccine protection in non-human primates was reported from memory immune responses as previously reported monkey vaccine challenge studies were conducted at the time near their peak immune responses (1-4 weeks from their last vaccination).
INO-4800-treated animals demonstrated seroconversion after a single vaccination, with protective neutralizing antibodies and T cells lasting in their blood more than four months after the initial dose. The antibody levels were similar to or greater than those seen in patients who have recovered from COVID-19, and the T cell responses were significantly higher than those from convalescent patients.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial
In December 2020, we announced the publication of peer-reviewed Phase 1 clinical data from the first cohort of 40 participants for INO-4800. In this trial, INO-4800 was immunogenic in all vaccinated subjects, generating an immune response of humoral (including neutralizing antibodies) and/or cellular responses (both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells).
Additionally, Phase 1 clinical data found INO-4800 to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported. Only six Grade 1 adverse events (AEs) were observed, primarily minor injection site reactions. Notably, these only occurred on the day of the first or second dosing, and the AEs did not increase in frequency with the second administration. 
U.S. Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial – INNOVATE
In December 2020, we announced the dosing of the first subject in our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating INO-4800, as part of our Phase 2/3 clinical trial, called INNOVATE (INOVIO INO-4800 Vaccine Trial for Efficacy). The Phase 2 segment of the trial has enrolled approximately 400 participants who are 18 years or older at up to 17 U.S. sites to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in order to confirm the dose(s) for the subsequent efficacy evaluation as part of the Phase 3 segment of the trial. 
The Phase 2 segment of the trial is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-4800 in a 2-dose regimen (1.0 mg or 2.0 mg), in a three-to-one randomization to receive either INO-4800 or placebo to confirm the more appropriate dosing level(s) for each of three age groups (18-50 years, 51-64 years and 65 years and older) at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for the subsequent Phase 3 efficacy evaluation.
The INNOVATE Phase 3 segment is planned as a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy evaluation of INO-4800 being conducted in adults 18 years and older. The INNOVATE trial is funded by the DoD Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND) in coordination with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (OASD (HA)) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA). 
The DoD has agreed to provide funding for both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 segments of INNOVATE, in addition to the $71.1 million of funding previously announced in June for the large-scale manufacture of CELLECTRA® 3PSP, production of doses and the procurement of CELLECTRA® 2000 devices.
INO-4800 in China
In December 2020, we announced the dosing of the first subject in our Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China. The Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted in China is independent of the INNOVATE Phase 2/3 clinical trial of INO-4800 and will enroll approximately 640 participants who are 18 years or older. Our collaborator Advaccine is conducting and funding the Phase 2 trial in China.
 The Phase 2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in China has enrolled both 18-59 years old adults and older adults (60 years and older) with the primary endpoints of evaluating safety and immunogenicity within the Chinese population. The dosing regimen involves two vaccinations at 0 and 28 days with either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg dosing levels and is similar to the Phase 2 segment of the INNOVATE trial. 
INO-4800 in South Korea
 In June 2020, we announced a partnership with the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), and Seoul National University Hospital to start a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INO-4800 in South Korea. The two-stage trial of INO-4800, the first clinical study of COVID-19 vaccine in Korea, will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-4800 in 40 healthy adults aged 19-50 years, and will further expand to enroll an additional 120 people aged 19-64 years. The trial is funded by CEPI through us and is supported by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention/Korea National Institute of Health.
COVID-19 dMAb®
In December 2020, we announced that we along with a team of scientists from The Wistar Institute, AstraZeneca, the University of Pennsylvania, and Indiana University received a $37.6 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research and development agency of the DoD and the JPEO-CBRND, to use our dMAb technology to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific dMAbs that function as both a therapeutic and preventive treatment for COVID-19. See “Synthetic DNA-based Monoclonal Antibodies Program” below for more information about our dMAb technology.
As part of DARPA's two-year grant, our and Wistar teams will construct COVID-19 dMAb® candidates mirroring AstraZeneca's traditional recombinant monoclonal antibody candidates currently being tested in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. These dMAb® candidates can be quickly developed and produced in vivo, offering a cost-effective and scalable therapeutic and preventive option for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The dMAb® candidates will then be advanced into preclinical studies and then into human clinical trials.
Global Manufacturing Consortium for INO-4800
In March 2020, we announced with Ology Bioservices Inc., a biologics contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), that the DoD awarded Ology Bioservices with a contract valued at $11.9 million to work with us on rapid manufacture DNA vaccines. This work is supported by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs with funding from the Defense Health Agency. Under this program, Ology Bioservices will work with us to manufacture INO-4800.
In March 2020, we received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate the testing and scale up of CELLECTRA® 3PSP proprietary smart devices for the intradermal delivery of INO-4800.
In April 2020, we announced an agreement to expand our manufacturing partnership with the German contract manufacturer Richter-Helm BioLogics GmbH & Co. KG, to support large-scale manufacturing of INO-4800.
In September 2020, we announced that Thermo Fisher Scientific signed a letter of intent to manufacture INO-4800.  Thermo Fisher plans to manufacture INO-4800 drug substance as well as perform fill and finish of INO-4800 drug product at its commercial facilities in the United States.
In December 2020, we announced the execution of an agreement with Kaneka Eurogentec S.A., an affiliate of Kaneka Corporation, for Eurogentec to manufacture INO-4800 at their GMP plasmid production scales. 
COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOC) 
We have been closely monitoring the development and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with a particular focus on the UK, South African and Brazilian variants of the virus. We are currently evaluating the impact of newly circulating strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the immune profile of INO-4800 through an assessment of binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies in both live and pseudo assays as well as assessing the impact of the INO-4800-generated T cell responses on these variants. 
We are also developing next-generation, pan-COVID vaccine candidates, that could be tailored to the known and potentially the unknown SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using our SynCon® gene optimization algorithm to analyze the available sequence data from all existing circulating variants, we are seeking to create a synthetic SAR-CoV-2 spike protein gene design intended to protect against the known VOC as well the future unknown strains. Our DNA vaccines generate a balanced immune response, including T cell responses,which we believe could make our pan-COVID vaccine candidates less susceptible to changes in the genetic sequence of the virus. DNA vaccines can also be used for multiple boosts without being impacted by 
anti-vector immunity or an increase in reactogenicity. Moreover, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials have shown that DNA vaccines could also be used to boost the initial immune responses generated by multiple other vaccine platforms.
INO-4700 for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
Background on MERS
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS appears to have been transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans but human to human transmission has been confirmed. The virus for this disease belongs to the Coronaviradea family (or a coronavirus – MERS-CoV), and was not shown to be a communicable virus spreading in a sustained way in communities, but rather via rapid spread in the nosocomial setting, such as emergency rooms and/or hospitals without adherence to state-of-the-art infection control practices, which can result in outbreaks with many cases, including super-spreading events. Like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 linked to another coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), which made approximately 8,000 people ill and was fatal in nearly 10% of those cases, MERS-CoV appears to cause severe lung infections. However, the case-fatality rate (death rate) of MERS has typically been between 30% and 40%, which is significantly higher than that of SARS. While the SARS epidemic in 2003 killed 10% of those who became ill from the SARS virus, MERS has killed approximately 34% of people who people who became ill from the MERS virus from 2012 to January 2020. MERS differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure. Its high death rate has caused serious concern among global health officials.
Despite the continuing threat of MERS outbreaks, there are no licensed vaccines or treatments for MERS. Since the virus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, the World Health Organization reports 2,519 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS and 866 deaths from MERS worldwide as of January 2020. Twenty-seven countries have reported cases, including Korea where an outbreak in the summer of 2015 resulted in 186 cases and 38 deaths. The majority of MERS cases reported in the world by country have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with a total of 2,121 cases, 788 associated deaths, and a case-fatality rate of 37% from 2012 through January 2020. Of those cases to date in Saudi Arabia, nearly 20% have been in healthcare workers. 
Preclinical Development – MERS 
In 2013, we announced that preclinical testing of our SynCon® MERS vaccine candidate, INO-4700 (also known as GLS-5300), had induced robust and durable immune responses in mice, demonstrating the potential for such a vaccine to prevent and treat this deadly virus. DNA medicine constructs targeting multiple MERS antigens were designed using our SynCon® vaccine platform with the goal to universally protect against multiple strains of MERS, which has been shown to have diverse genetic variants. These SynCon® constructs were administered via our CELLECTRA® smart delivery technology.
A consensus MERS "spike" protein vaccine construct was created based on multiple strains of the MERS virus. 
In 2015, we announced that our MERS vaccine had induced 100% protection from a live virus challenge in a preclinical study in mice, camels and monkeys, or non-human primates. In all three species, the vaccine induced robust immune responses capable of preventing the virus from infecting cells. We believe the data from camels is an important finding because camels represent not only a host reservoir of the disease, but also act as a mode of transmission to humans. In monkeys, all vaccinated animals in the study were protected from symptoms of MERS disease when challenged with a live MERS virus.
The preclinical results appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine.
Clinical Development – MERS 
In 2016, we and our collaborator GeneOne commenced a Phase 1, dose-escalation clinical trial of INO-4700 in 75 healthy volunteers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Maryland. The primary and secondary goals of this Phase 1 trial are to obtain safety and immunogenicity data. This trial represents the first MERS vaccine to be tested in humans for this disease that has no approved vaccines or treatments.
In 2016, we announced that the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) will provide new funding and support to further advance the clinical development of INO-4700. IVI will add technical, laboratory and financial support for INO-4700 clinical trials in Korea with the goal to advance clinical testing toward emergency use authorization by the Korean government as well as authorities of other countries. This collaborative funding is part of a grant from the Samsung Foundation to IVI to support the development of a MERS vaccine for emergency use in Korea and internationally.
In April 2018, we announced a collaboration with CEPI under which we will develop vaccine candidates against MERS. CEPI will fund up to $56 million of costs to support our pre-clinical and clinical advancement through Phase 2 of INO-4700. The goal of the collaboration is for the MERS vaccine to be available as soon as possible for emergency use.
In June 2018, we announced positive results from the Phase 1 trial of INO-4700 for MERS. In the trial, treatment with INO-4700 was well tolerated and resulted in overall high levels of antibody responses in roughly 95% of subjects, while also generating broad-based T cell responses in nearly 90% of study participants. Antibody responses were observed in 94% of subjects at week 14 (two weeks after the third dose). Additionally, there were no statistically significant dose-dependent 
differences in antibody response rates (91%, 95%, and 95% at doses of 0.67, 2, and 6 mg, respectively). Durable antibody responses were also maintained through 60 weeks following dosing. These results were published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in a peer-reviewed article entitled, "Safety and immunogenicity of an anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus DNA vaccine: A phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation trial." 
In September 2018, we announced the dosing of the first subject in a Phase 1/2a study of INO-4700 for MERS in South Korea funded by IVI.
In April 2020, we announced interim data through week 16 from a Phase 1/2a trial of DNA vaccine INO-4700. Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong antibody and T cell immune responses after 2 or 3 doses with 0.6 mg, delivered intradermally with our CELLECTRA® device. The vaccination regimen was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated severe adverse events (SAEs). The researchers at the Wistar Institute, Seoul National University Hospital, and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) collaborated on this study.
For those receiving 0.6 mg of INO-4700, 88% demonstrated seroconversion after a 2 dose regimen at 0 and 8 weeks, while for those receiving a 3 dose regimen given at 0, 4 and 12 weeks, 84% seroconverted after 2 doses and 100% after 3 doses, as measured by a binding antibody assay against the full-length S protein (ELISA). Additionally, 92% of the vaccine recipients in both groups displayed the ability to neutralize the virus using a pseudotype-based neutralization assay. Robust T cell responses were observed in 60% of vaccine recipients after the 2 dose regimen and 84% of those in the 3 dose group (ELISpot assay). A single dose of 0.6 mg of INO-4700 intradermal vaccination resulted in 74% binding antibody response rate and 48% neutralization antibody response rate.
INO-4212 for Ebola Virus Disease
Background on Ebola
The Ebola virus causes one of the most virulent viral diseases, with case fatality rates averaging 50% but approaching up to 90% in past outbreaks in areas with no or under-developed health care. Ebola can spread through human-to-human transmission by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of an infected individual and with surfaces or materials that contain the contaminated fluids of an infected person, such as bedding and clothing. It is capable of causing death within two to twenty-one days of exposure. In November 2019, the first conditional approval was issued for a preventive vaccine against Ebola virus. This approval was from the EMA for the vaccine ERVEBO®. That same month, the WHO pre-qualified that vaccine for use in high-risk countries. In the next month, the FDA approved that vaccine. However, there are no proven effective therapeutic treatments for Ebola. In addition, various experimental approaches have already been associated with undesirable side effects and limited ability to scale manufacturing.
According to the CDC, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic was the largest Ebola outbreak in world history, resulting in 28,610 suspected and confirmed cases and 11,308 deaths as of June 2016, when it was declared over.
In 2018, two Ebola outbreaks occurred, both in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The second Ebola outbreak of 2018 in the DRC became the second largest Ebola outbreak in world history. This particular outbreak had a 66% case-fatality ratio (aka case-fatality rate) as of February 2020. On June 1, 2020 an additional Ebola outbreak was declared in the DRC, before the outbreak was declared over on November 18, 2020.
Preclinical and Clinical Development - Ebola
In 2014, we entered into a collaboration with GeneOne to advance a DNA immunotherapy for Ebola into clinical development. The decision to advance our Ebola immunotherapy was based on positive results observed in preclinical studies, in which 100% of immunized guinea pigs and mice were protected from death after being exposed to the Ebola virus. Unlike the non-immunized animals, immunized animals were also protected from weight loss, a measure of morbidity. Researchers found significant increases in neutralizing antibody titers and strong and broad levels of immunotherapy-induced T cells, including "killer" T cells, suggesting that DNA immunotherapy could provide both preventive and treatment benefits. This data was published in 2013 in the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Therapy.
In 2015, we received a contract from DARPA to lead a consortium to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola. Other collaborators include AstraZeneca, GeneOne and David B. Weiner, Ph.D., a director of our company, who also serves as executive vice president at the Wistar Institute. A previous collaboration agreement with GeneOne for Ebola was incorporated into this consortium funded by DARPA.
We are taking a multi-faceted approach to develop products to prevent and treat Ebola infection. These programs include development and early clinical testing of:
•A therapeutic DNA-based monoclonal antibody product against the Ebola virus infection, which we believe has properties that best fit a response to the outbreak in that they could be designed and manufactured expediently on a large scale using common fermentation technology, are thermal-stable, and may provide more rapid therapeutic benefit;
•A highly potent conventional protein-based therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) product against Ebola virus infection; and
•A DNA-based vaccine against Ebola.
Our contract with DARPA covers the pre-clinical development costs for the dMAb products and protein mAb candidates, as well as GMP manufacturing costs and the Phase 1 clinical trial costs for the three product candidates described above.
In 2015, we and our collaborators initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of INO-4212, an Ebola DNA vaccine to evaluate its safety, tolerability and immune responses in 75 healthy subjects divided into five study arms. INO-4212 consists of two optimized SynCon® DNA plasmids coding for the Ebola glycoprotein antigen from circulating Ebola strains from 1975-2014. The study was designed to evaluate INO-4212 and its components, alone or in combination with our product candidate INO-9012, delivered into muscle or skin using our proprietary DNA smart delivery technology.
In 2016, we reported initial results from the trial. Of 69 evaluated subjects, 64 (92.8%) seroconverted and mounted a strong antibody response to the Ebola glycoprotein antigen following the three dose immunization regimen; 48 subjects (69.6%) seroconverted after only two doses.
In the study arm using intradermal (skin) administration, 13 of 13 evaluable subjects (100%) generated antigen-specific antibody responses after only two doses, and all remained seropositive after three immunizations. Similarly, in the study arm receiving the vaccine with intramuscular administration in combination with plasmid IL-12, 13 of 13 evaluable subjects (100%) produced strong antibody responses after three immunizations, and 12 of 13 (92.3%) achieved strong antibody responses after only two immunizations.
The Ebola glycoprotein specific geometric mean antibody titers measured in the five cohorts ranged from over 2,000 to greater than 46,000. Significantly, a majority of vaccinated subjects in each of the five cohorts produced strong Ebola antigen specific T cell responses as measured by interferon gamma ELISpot analysis.
INO-4212 was well tolerated, with no systemic serious adverse effects observed. Side effects, such as fever, joint pain, and low white blood cell counts have previously been reported following treatment with some viral vector based Ebola vaccines currently in development. Moreover, unlike the viral vectored vaccines which must be kept frozen, the INO-4212 formulation used in the trial was kept in a solution which was refrigerated at 2-8 degrees Celsius.
In 2016, we announced that enrollment of this study was being expanded to up to 200 subjects to further characterize and identify in humans the most optimal immunization regimen using intradermal (skin) delivery of the Ebola DNA vaccine.
In 2017, we reported preliminary results from the expanded Phase 1 trial. Across both stages of the trial, including both intramuscular and intradermal delivery, 95% (170/179) of evaluable subjects generated an Ebola-specific antibody immune response, with the mean antibody titer comparable or superior to those reported from viral vector-based Ebola vaccines. Our Ebola vaccine was also well tolerated in the second stages of the trial, with a favorable safety profile compared to viral vector-based Ebola vaccines, some of which have been associated with serious adverse events including myalgia, arthralgia, fever, and rash.
In October 2018, we announced that INO-4212 provided 100% protection following a challenge with a lethal dose of the Ebola virus in a preclinical study. An article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases highlighted that regimens of the INO-4212 vaccine delivered by intramuscular administration provided 100% protection against a lethal Ebola challenge in all preclinical animals. In a separate study, two injections by intradermal administration generated strong immunogenicity and provided 100% protection against a lethal Ebola challenge. In the study, scientists observed that vaccination induced long-term immune responses in monkeys that were detectable for at least one year after the final vaccination.
In March 2019, Phase 1 clinical data of our Ebola vaccine candidate INO-4201 was published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. We believe that this study, which is being fully funded by DARPA, further supports the advancement of the intradermal delivery platform for emerging infectious diseases. Significantly, intradermal (skin) administration with our CELLECTRA® smart delivery device resulted in 100% of evaluable subjects in the study generating antigen-specific antibody responses that persisted for more than one year in most subjects and generated T cell responses equivalent to or better than the group that received intramuscular delivery. We believe these published data further validate the tolerability, potency, and product stability advantages of our vaccine and immunotherapy platform.
Our Ebola vaccine candidate was evaluated in five groups of healthy subjects. Of 70 evaluated subjects, 67 (96%) seroconverted and mounted a strong antibody response to the Ebola glycoprotein antigen following the three dose immunization regimen; 52 subjects (74%) seroconverted after only two doses.
In the study arm using intradermal (skin) administration, 13 of 13 evaluable subjects (100%) generated antigen-specific antibody responses after only two doses and all remained seropositive after three immunizations.
To date INO-4201 has been well-tolerated and has not demonstrated systemic serious adverse effects, such as fever, joint pain, and low white blood cell counts, reported in association with some viral vector-based Ebola vaccines currently in development.
INO-4500 for Lassa Fever
Background on Lassa Fever
Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever, is an acute viral disease which occurs mostly in West Africa. The disease can cause a range of outcomes including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and swelling of the face, pain in the muscles, chest, back and abdomen, bleeding of various parts of the body including the eyes and nose, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract, and death. Of the survivors of Lassa fever, about one-third have sudden-onset hearing loss, with more than half of those cases resulting in permanent hearing loss. This infection is spread through contact with infected rodents. Person to person transmission is also possible, via bodily fluids, albeit less common. Lassa virus infection in West Africa is estimated to affect 100,000 to 300,000 people annually, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths, as disease and infection surveillance has been poor. Because of difficulties in diagnosing Lassa fever and the remoteness of many areas in which the disease occurs, the numbers of cases and deaths are likely significantly under-reported. Though the majority (about 80%) of Lassa virus-infected persons are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, the infection can be quite serious to fatal in others. There are no licensed vaccines or treatments specifically for Lassa. The case-fatality ratio (aka case-fatality rate) (CFR) among patients hospitalized for Lassa fever is about 15% to 20%, and in some epidemics the CFR has reached 50% in hospitalized patients, such as in the 2015-2016 Nigeria portion of the West Africa outbreak. In lab confirmed cases in Nigeria from 2019 through 2020, the CFR was 21%. The CFR among pregnant women is particularly high, and in pregnant women infected with Lassa virus the fetal death rate due to spontaneous abortion rate is estimated to be about 95%.
Clinical Trials
In May 2019, we dosed our first patient in our Phase 1, first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate INO-4500, a DNA candidate vaccine to prevent infection from the Lassa virus. In 2019, we fully enrolled 60 volunteers in this placebo controlled, blinded, dose escalation study evaluating INO-4500 for safety, tolerability and immune responses. This trial represents the first Lassa candidate vaccine to enter the clinic. Our sponsored trial, as well as our INO-4500 program, is fully funded through the global partnership with CEPI that we entered into in April 2018.
If the results of this study are positive, we expect to advance INO-4500 into both Phase 1b and Phase 2 field trials in endemic countries of West Africa. If satisfactory Phase 2 data are achieved, CEPI, in cooperation with local regulatory authorities and the WHO, could elect to stockpile the vaccine for future use throughout the region. 
Other Development Candidates
INO-1800 for the Treatment of Hepatitis B Virus
Although an effective preventive vaccine against hepatitis B virus, or HBV, infection has existed for over three decades, HBV remains a major epidemic, especially among people of Asian and African descent. The World Health Organization estimates that 2 billion people globally are or have been infected with HBV, with over 257 million people chronically infected with the virus and at risk of developing the major complications of cirrhosis or liver cancer. It is estimated that over two million people in the United States are chronically infected with the virus, including those who were foreign-born. Currently, the only therapies available for chronically infected individuals are interferon-alpha and nucleoside analog treatments, which function by controlling viral replication, but they do not clear infection. Interferon can prevent viral replication in only 30% of patients and does so with undesirable side effects.
Liver cancer is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, and it kills the vast majority of patients within five years of diagnosis in the U.S. Approximately 900,000 new cases arose in 2020 worldwide. Liver cancer is estimated to have 42,230 new cases occur and kill more than 30,000 U.S. persons in 2021. One of the major causes and risk factors for liver cancer is infection by hepatitis B. Chronically infected individuals may develop a permanent scarring of the liver, a condition called cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis can evolve into hepatocellular carcinoma, which claimed an estimated 830,000 lives worldwide in 2020.
INO-1800 is encoded for the HBcAg antigen and represents a consensus of the unique HBcAg DNA sequences of all major HBV genotypes (A through E). When delivered by CELLECTRA®, in a preclinical study, INO-1800 elicited strong HBcAg-specific T cell and antibody responses in the periphery (outside of the liver) as measured by ELISpot, ICS and cell proliferation assays. Researchers observed that the immunization could also induce antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that produced both IFN-y and TNF-a in the liver, indicating that a strong immunotherapy-induced T cell response was also present in the liver.
In the preclinical study, the antigen-specific T cells exhibited a killing function and were able to migrate to and stay in the liver and cause clearance of target cells without any evidence of liver injury. This was the first study to provide evidence that intramuscular immunization could induce killer T cells that can migrate to the liver and eliminate target cells.
In 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate INO-1800 in patients chronically infected with HBV. This randomized, open-label, active-controlled, dose escalation study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of INO-1800 alone or in combination with INO-9012. This international study enrolled patients in the United States and Asia Pacific region with a primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of the therapy. Secondary endpoints are evaluating the cellular and humoral immune response to INO-1800 and its effect on several viral and antiviral parameters. All trial subjects are also medicated with standard-of-care antiviral therapies.
In March 2018, we announced interim results from the trial, in which INO-1800 was well-tolerated and generated virus-specific T cells, including CD8+ killer T cells, meeting the objectives of the clinical study. Preliminary immunology data from the trial revealed that treatment of patients with INO-1800 resulted in the generation of T cells that recognized key components of the hepatitis B virus and reacted by making antiviral cytokines such as Interferon gamma, a protein believed to be linked to clearance of HBV from the liver. In the trial, INO-1800 was also able to activate and expand CD8+ killer T cells that displayed markers believed to be important for retention in the liver as well as multiple potential mechanisms for killing virally infected cells.
We are currently seeking a collaboration partner in order to further advance the clinical development of INO-1800.
Synthetic DNA-based Monoclonal Antibody Programs
Background on recombinant Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)
Recombinant mAbs have become one of the most valuable therapeutic technologies of recent years. In 2020, global sales of mAbs exceeded $100 billion.
mAbs are designed to bind to a very specific epitope (area) of an antigen or cell surface target and can bind to almost any selected target. They have the ability to alert the immune system to attack and kill specific cancer cells (as in the case of Yervoy®) or block certain biochemical pathways (such as those leading to rheumatoid arthritis, as in the case of Humira®). However, mAb technology has limitations. mAbs are manufactured outside the body and require costly large-scale laboratory development and production. Additional limitations include high cost to develop and manufacture, their limited duration of in vivo potency, and a pharmacokinetic profile that can result in toxicity. We have created DNA encoded monoclonal antibodies that we believe may overcome many of the limitations associated with conventional mAb technology.
Using our core platform technology, we insert the DNA sequence for a specific monoclonal antibody in a DNA plasmid. We deliver the plasmid directly into cells of the body using our CELLECTRA®  smart delivery system, enabling the electroporated cells to manufacture those mAbs in vivo, - unlike conventional mAb technology that requires manufacture outside of the body. We believe this approach provides potentially significant advantages in terms of design simplicity, rapidity of execution and lower production costs.
We expect to design dMAb® product candidates not only for new disease targets not currently addressable with conventional recombinant mAbs, but also targets of existing, commercially available mAb products. We have already designed and produced dMAb product candidates targeting cancer mechanisms including checkpoint inhibition, anti-cancer pathways and anti-Tregs, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic dMAb product candidates for infectious diseases including Ebola, influenza, antibiotic resistant bacteria, dengue and Chikungunya.
Proof of Concept
Our first published research on a DNA-based monoclonal antibody was presented in October 2013 in the journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics. In a preclinical study, a single administration in mice of a highly optimized dMAb® HIV immunotherapy generated antibody molecules in the bloodstream that possessed desirable functional activity, including high antigen-binding and HIV-neutralization capabilities, against diverse strains of HIV viruses. In the study, this delivery strategy resulted in an increase in Fab levels in as little as 48 hours, when compared with protein-based immunization.
A second paper was published in July 2015 in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group journal. In this study, a single intramuscular injection of a DNA plasmid encoding a monoclonal antibody targeting dengue protected mice subsequently exposed to the dengue virus. The protection conferred by the monoclonal antibodies expressed by these dMAb product candidates was very rapid, with 100% survival in mice challenged with lethal enhanced dengue disease less than a week after dMAb administration. While conventional vaccine and monoclonal antibody technologies have shown limited ability to provide an effective solution to dengue to date, the unique attributes and data generated by dMAb immunotherapies show their potential to provide a needed solution. Furthermore, this short time frame to achieve full protection is significantly more rapid than vaccine-driven protection, which can take weeks to months to reach peak efficacy levels.
A paper published in March 2016 in The Journal of Infectious Diseases discussed the results of our preclinical study in which animals transfected with our DNA-based mAb targeting Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exhibited the specific ability to bind to the CHIKV envelope antigen, and this serum possessed CHIKV-neutralizing activity. CHIKV is a serious mosquito-borne alpha-virus responsible for several recent epidemics in tropical Africa and Asia. In mid-2015, the CDC reported that suspected or confirmed cases of Chikungunya had reached 1.74 million in 45 countries or territories in the Americas. There is 
currently no vaccine or therapeutic against this virus. In the study, the treatment of the animals with anti-CHIKV mAb plasmids protected 100% of the treated animals from a lethal injection of CHIKV virus while 100% of the control animals died. The treated animals were also spared virus-related morbidity, as measured by dramatic weight loss and lethargy.
Next Steps
In October 2014, DARPA awarded a $12.2 million grant to our scientists and those from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and AstraZeneca in order to develop and assess dMAb product candidates in preclinical studies.
This collaboration aims to demonstrate that DNA plasmids can activate sufficient quantities of disease-specific monoclonal antibodies in the body to be protective against a pathogen challenge. Using the capabilities and advantages of DNA plasmids delivered using CELLECTRA®, the team is constructing and evaluating multiple dMAb product candidates focused on influenza virus and antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
In 2016, we expanded the collaboration to include The Wistar Institute after the collaborating investigator, Dr. David Weiner, a member of our board of directors, moved to the Institute.
Depending on the outcome of the preclinical studies, we and our collaborators may seek to advance a dMAb product candidate into clinical trials, if we are able to obtain additional governmental or non-governmental funding to do so.
As described above, in April 2015, we received a grant from DARPA to lead a consortium to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola. The aim of the research funded by this grant is to compare combinations of a DNA vaccine with conventional or DNA-based monoclonal antibodies.
In July 2016, we announced that our DNA-based monoclonal antibody technology will be deployed to develop product candidates which could be used alone and in combination with other immunotherapies in the pursuit of new ways to treat and potentially cure infection from HIV. Funding for this research is part of a $23 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to our collaborator, The Wistar Institute.
As described above, we have also received a sub-grant through The Wistar Institute to develop a DNA-based monoclonal antibody designed to provide a fast-acting treatment against Zika infection and its debilitating effects.
In February 2019, we announced that in collaboration with The Wistar Institute and the University of Pennsylvania, the first subject was dosed as part of the first-ever human study of our dMAb technology. Funded fully by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, this trial's focus is on the safety and tolerability of DNA plasmid encoding for a human anti-Zika antibody. This open-label trial is a single center, dose escalation trial that enrolled 24 healthy volunteers who received from one to four doses of INO-A002, inovio’s DNA plasmid encoding for a human anti-Zika antibody. Doses ranges from 0.5 mg to 4 mg of plasmids injected per subjects, independent of their body weight.
As described above, we have received grant funding to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific dMAbs® to function as both a therapeutic and preventive treatment for COVID-19.
License, Collaboration, Supply and Other Agreements
We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees and others. These arrangements are summarized below.
Advaccine 
In December 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Advaccine. Under the terms of the Agreement, we have granted to Advaccine the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize our vaccine candidate INO-4800 within the territories of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (referred to collectively as “Greater China”). Advaccine will not have the right to grant sublicenses, other than to affiliated entities, without our express prior written consent. 
Under the Agreement, Advaccine has made an upfront payment to us of $3.0 million. In addition to the upfront payment, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $108.0 million, payable upon the achievement of specified milestones related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of INO-4800, including the achievement of specified net sales thresholds for INO-4800 in Greater China, if approved. As of December 31, 2020, we have earned a $2.0 million milestone payment based on the enrollment of the first subject in the Phase 2 clinical trial for the product in the Advaccine territory. We are also entitled to receive a royalty equal to a high single-digit percentage of annual net sales in each region within Greater China, subject to reduction in the event of competition from biosimilar products in a particular region and in other specified circumstances. Advaccine’s obligation to pay royalties will continue, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and region-by-region basis, for ten years after the first commercial sale in a particular region within Greater China or, if later, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a given licensed product in a given region.
Under the Agreement, Advaccine will be responsible for the development and commercialization of the licensed products at its own cost and expense and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval of INO-4800, as well as our CELLECTRA® device and arrays for use in connection with the administration of INO-4800, in each region in Greater China. In the event that we have not initiated the planned Phase 3 segment of our ongoing clinical trial of INO-4800 in the United States within one year after entering into the Agreement, Advaccine may elect to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial outside of Greater China at its own cost and expense for the purposes of obtaining regulatory approval in China, subject to our right to review and approve the protocols and design of such a trial.
AstraZeneca
In August 2015, we entered into a strategic cancer vaccine collaboration and license agreement with AstraZeneca. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca acquired exclusive rights to our immunotherapy candidate INO-3112 (renamed MEDI0457), which targets cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.
Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca made an upfront payment of $27.5 million to us in the third quarter of 2015. AstraZeneca will fund all development costs. The agreement also calls for potential future payments totaling up to $700 million upon reaching specified development and commercial milestones. We are entitled to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on MEDI0457 product sales.
AstraZeneca is studying MEDI0457 in combination with its PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cancer associated with HPV. On December 28, 2017, we received a $7.0 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca, which was triggered by the initiation of the Phase 2 portion of this ongoing clinical trial. In December 2018, we received a $2.0 million milestone payment upon the dosing of the first cervical cancer patient in the trial. In January 2019, we received a $2.0 million milestone payment upon the initiation of a Phase 2 combination trial to evaluate MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab targeting a broad array of cancers associated with HPV.
ApolloBio
In December 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement with Beijing Apollo Saturn Biological Technology Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of China, or ApolloBio. Under the terms of this License and Collaboration Agreement, which became effective in March 2018, we granted to ApolloBio the exclusive right to develop and commercialize VGX-3100, our DNA immunotherapy product candidate designed to treat pre-cancers caused by HPV, within the territories of China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The territory may be expanded to include Korea in the event that no patent covering VGX-3100 issues in China within the first three years of the term of the agreement.
As part of the License and Collaboration Agreement, we have granted to ApolloBio an option to negotiate an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize MEDI0457 in the event of termination of our current collaboration with AstraZeneca for the development of MEDI0457 in the territory covered by the License and Collaboration Agreement. As part of the collaboration, ApolloBio will fund all clinical development costs within the licensed territory, and the parties will discuss in good faith the inclusion of clinical trial sites in China as part of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical development program for VGX-3100.
Under the License and Collaboration Agreement, we received proceeds of $19.4 million in March 2018, which comprised an upfront payment of $23.0 million less $2.2 million in foreign income taxes and $1.4 million in certain foreign non-income taxes. The foreign income taxes were recorded as a provision for income taxes and the foreign non-income taxes were recorded as a general and administrative expense, on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition to the upfront payment, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $20.0 million, less required income, withholding or other taxes, upon the achievement of specified milestones related to the regulatory approval of VGX-3100 in the United States, China and Korea. In the event that VGX-3100 is approved for marketing in these territories, we will be entitled to receive royalty payments based on a tiered percentage of annual net sales, with such percentage being in the low- to mid-teens, subject to reduction in the event of generic competition in a particular territory. ApolloBio’s obligation to pay royalties will continue for 10 years after the first commercial sale in a particular territory or, if later, until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering the licensed products in the specified territory. The License and Collaboration Agreement, once effective, will continue in force until ApolloBio has no remaining royalty obligations.
Competition
As we develop and seek to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, we face and will continue to encounter competition with an array of existing or development-stage drug and immunotherapy approaches targeting diseases we are pursuing. We are aware of various established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical companies, broadly engaged in vaccine/immunotherapy research and development. These include Janssen Pharmaceuticals (part of J&J), Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck, Pfizer, and our collaborator AstraZeneca. There are also various development-stage biotechnology companies involved in different vaccine and immunotherapy technologies including but not limited to Advaxis, 
Bavarian Nordic, BioNTech, CureVac, Dynavax, Hookipa, Iovance, Moderna, Nektar, Novavax, Translate Bio and Vir Biotechnology. If these companies are successful in developing their technologies, it could materially and adversely affect our business and our future growth prospects.
Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have commercialized preventive vaccines against HPV to protect against cervical cancer. Some companies are seeking to treat early HPV infections or low grade cervical dysplasia. Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure, commonly known as LEEP, is the current standard of care for treating high-grade cervical dysplasia. Advaxis and Gilead Sciences have therapeutic cervical cancer product candidates under development. Many companies are pursuing different approaches to GBM, prostate, breast, lung and other cancers we are targeting.
A large number of companies are actively advancing COVID-19 vaccines through the clinic. Pfizer and BioNtech, Moderna Therapeutics, Janssen (J&J) and AstraZeneca have received approval for their COVID-19 vaccines from either the U.S. or European regulatory authorities. Additionally, several companies such as CanSino Biologics, SinoVAc, Bharat Biotech and Novavax are currently developing vaccine candidates into Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical stage of development.
We also compete more specifically with companies seeking to utilize antigen-encoding DNA delivered with electroporation or other DNA delivery technologies such as viral vectors or lipid vectors to induce in vivo generated antigen production and immune responses to prevent or treat various diseases. These competitive technologies have shown promise, but they each also have their unique obstacles to overcome.
Viral Vaccine Delivery
This technology utilizes a virus as a carrier to deliver genetic material into target cells. The method is efficient for delivering immunotherapy antigens and has the advantage of mimicking real viral infection so that the recipient will mount a broad immune response against the immunotherapy. The greatest limitation of the technology stems from problems with unwanted immune responses against the viral vector, limiting its use to patients who have not been previously exposed to the viral vector and making repeated administration difficult. In addition, complexity and safety concerns increase their cost and complicate regulatory approval.
Lipid DNA/RNA Delivery
A number of lipid formulations have been developed that increase the effect of DNA/RNA immunotherapies. These work by either increasing uptake of the DNA/RNA into cells or by acting as an adjuvant, alerting the immune system. While there has been significant progress in this field, including emergency approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in 2020, lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNA has thermal stability issues as well as the potential of adverse events from the lipid nanoparticle formulations. 
DNA Immunotherapy Delivery with Electroporation
There are other companies with electroporation intellectual property and devices. We believe we have significant competitive advantages over other companies focused on electroporation for multiple reasons:
•We have an extensive history and experience in developing the methods and devices that optimize the use of electroporation in conjunction with DNA-based agents. This experience has been validated with multiple sets of interim data from multiple clinical studies assessing DNA-based immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious disease. 
•We have a broad product line of electroporation instruments designed to enable DNA delivery in tumors, muscle, and skin.
•We have been proactive in filing for patents, as well as acquiring and licensing additional patents, to expand our global patent estate.
If any of our competitors develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our product candidates, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours.
Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, 
reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales.
The FDA and other regulatory agencies may expand current requirements for public disclosure of DNA-based product development data, which may harm our competitive position with foreign and United States companies developing DNA-based products for similar indications.
Commercialization and Manufacturing
Because of the broad potential applications of our technologies, we intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through our collaborators and licensees. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, such as infectious diseases and cancer. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances.
We believe our plasmids can be produced in commercial quantities through uniform methods of fermentation and processing that are applicable to all plasmids. We believe we will be able to obtain sufficient supplies of plasmids for all foreseeable clinical investigations.
Intellectual Property 
Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We file for patent registration extensively in the United States and in key foreign markets. Although our patent filings include claims covering various features of our products and product candidates, including composition, methods of manufacture and use, our patents do not provide us with complete protection, or guarantee, against the development of competing products. In addition, some of our know-how and technology are not patentable. We thus also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements, but such agreements may provide limited protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information.
Our intellectual property portfolio covers our proprietary technologies, including CELLECTRA® delivery systems as well as immunotherapy and vaccine construct related technologies. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio included 84 issued United States patents and over 500 issued foreign counterpart patents. We also have a number of patent applications pending in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business would thus be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation through the courts. In addition, our patents, or any other patents that may be issued to us in the future, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in each country where we operate. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and domestic and international mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in those countries may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. We may be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation, whether or not it is ultimately resolved in our favor, would result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.
There may be rights we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third-parties could bring claims against us, and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third-party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators, which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us.
Important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biologic products, including vaccines, and processes in the United States and other important markets outside the United States, such as Europe and Japan. Foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the United States patent system. We recognize that litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others’ proprietary rights. Any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to interrupt our operations, redesign our products or processes, or negotiate a license agreement, all of which would adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products.
We cannot guarantee that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, or biologics, and medical devices, such as our product candidates. Generally, before a new biologic or medical device can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Review and Approval of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
•A product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
•Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products;
•A drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
•Any investigational drug, device, or biological packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 
Our product candidates are combination products comprising an electroporation device for delivery of a biologic. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product, which means the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic product, that is, if it acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. We believe that all of our product candidates will have a biologic primary mode of action, with the device component reviewed under a Device Master File.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its proposed indication;
•Submission to the FDA of a BLA;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency;
•Potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 
The data required to support a BLA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. The pre-clinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and preliminary evaluation of efficacy is assessed. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites, in multiple countries (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and 
provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may grant conditional approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials, such as these post-approval trials, to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important rate increase of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated intervals based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA and FDA Review Process
Following trial completion, trial data is analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the product candidate, and other relevant information. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity, potency and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing. The application includes positive findings from pre-clinical and clinical trials as well as ambiguous or negative results. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is adjusted on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, sixty days after the BLA’s submission, the FDA’s goal is to review BLAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review or six months of the filing date for priority review, if the application is for a product intended for a serious or life-threatening condition and the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. If not accepted for filing, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA and begin the FDA’s review process again, including the initial sixty day review to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug product candidates or drug product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during 
the review process. The review and evaluation of a BLA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving a BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific populations, severities of allergies, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, a manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, also known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. Moreover, the constituent parts of a combination product retain their regulatory status, for example, as a biologic or device, and as such, we may be subject to additional requirements in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, applicable to medical devices, such as design controls, purchasing controls, and corrective and preventive action. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by 
the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, REMS and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, a pharmaceutical company’s ability to commercialize its products successfully depends in part on the extent to which private health insurers, other third-party payors, and governmental authorities, including Medicare and Medicaid, establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for its product candidates and related treatments. As a threshold for coverage and reimbursement, third-party payors generally require that products be approved for marketing by the FDA.
Coverage decisions may not favor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. The process for obtaining coverage for a product or service is separate from the process to obtain the associated reimbursement. Reimbursement levels can affect the adoption of products and services by physicians and patients. Additionally, products used in connection with medical procedures may not be reimbursed separately, but their cost may instead be bundled as part of the payment received by the provider for the procedure only. Separate reimbursement for a product or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available.
Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and costly which may require the provision of scientific and clinical support for the use of the product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
A significant trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products and services. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. Moreover, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
Healthcare Reform
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that impact the ability to sell pharmaceutical products profitably. In the United States, the federal government enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA. Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that it:
•Created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
•Increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
•Created new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•Expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•Expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program;
•Created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
•Established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011; and
•Created a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry qualifying health insurance coverage for all or part of a year. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax, and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made. Further, although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration 
until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. Further, at the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Healthcare Laws
Certain federal, state, local and foreign healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, transparency, patients' rights, and privacy are applicable to the business of a pharmaceutical company. The laws that may affect a pharmaceutical company’s ability to operate include:
•The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, people from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, ordering, or leasing of an item, good, facility or service, for which payment may be made by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid;
•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain individuals and entities; 
•the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, and which, beginning in 2022, will require applicable manufacturers to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives;
•The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; 
•The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which, among other things, prohibits companies issuing stock in the U.S. from bribing foreign officials for government contracts and other business; and
•State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and
•Additional state and local laws such as laws in California and Massachusetts, which mandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other state and local laws, such as laws in Vermont, Maine, and Minnesota which require reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians. 
A pharmaceutical company will need to spend substantial time and money to ensure that its business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness 
of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, which require strict compliance in order to offer protection, it is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that its business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If a pharmaceutical company’s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, it may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity and/or other oversight obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Other Regulations
We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of February 12, 2021, we employed 262 people on a full-time basis. Of the combined total, 210 were in product research, which includes research and development, quality assurance, clinical, engineering and manufacturing, and 52 were in general and administrative functions, which includes corporate development, information technology, legal, investor relations, finance and corporate administration. About 50% of our workforce is comprised of women and approximately 50% is 
comprised of individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds. In addition, three of the seven members of our board of directors are women. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
We compete in the highly competitive biotechnology industry. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in research, quality assurance, clinical, engineering, manufacturing and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and work environment. To that end, we invest in our employees to be an employer of choice.
Employee Engagement
As we work to make an impact on how healthcare is delivered, we believe it is critical that our employees are informed and engaged. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, employee surveys and our company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions to INOVIO through several rewards and recognition award programs. We believe these engagement efforts keep employees informed about our strategy, culture and purpose and motivated to do their best work. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also further strengthened our digital communication platform. Our employee communications during the pandemic have kept our employees informed on critical priorities, important actions being taken by management in response to the pandemic.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success.
The environmental, health and safety team stays abreast of local, regional and global concerns and trends and ensures safety procedures are in place to mitigate workplace injuries and safety risks. Employees are required to complete training in various safety procedures for the laboratories and manufacturing facilities and specialized safety training based on particular job duties. Designated Safety Officers and response teams oversee safety-related initiatives and a safety committee that provides input on safety procedures, practices, and policies. Employees are required to wear personal protective equipment relevant for their particular job duties. Occupational injuries at the workplace are extremely low and are always investigated to determine if any environmental or other changes need to be implemented.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, strict safety protocols have been put in place for employees working on-site, including following federal and local guidelines and mandates to ensure the safety of the workforce. In addition to providing the necessary personal protective equipment, special engineering controls have been installed at the facilities to further protect workers. Regular communication and training about the virus and how individuals can protect themselves and others is ongoing with employees.
