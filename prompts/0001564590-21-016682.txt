Item 1. Business
Overview 
 We are a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel treatments for gastrointestinal, or GI, diseases. Our initial product candidate, vonoprazan, is an oral small molecule potassium-competitive acid blocker, or P-CAB. P-CABs are a novel class of medicines that block acid secretion in the stomach. Vonoprazan has shown rapid, potent, and durable anti-secretory effects and has demonstrated clinical benefits over the current standard of care as a single agent in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, and in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, infection. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, developed vonoprazan and has received marketing approval in fourteen countries in Asia and Latin America. Vonoprazan generated approximately $650 million in net sales in its fifth full year on the market since its approval in Japan in late 2014. In May 2019, we in-licensed the U.S., European, and Canadian rights to vonoprazan from Takeda. 
 We believe we can leverage Takeda’s extensive clinical data, including results from 19 Phase 3 clinical trials, to advance vonoprazan through pivotal trials in the United States and Europe. We initiated two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2019 for vonoprazan: one for the treatment of erosive GERD (PHALCON-EE), also known as erosive esophagitis, or EE, and a second for the treatment of H. pylori infection (PHALCON-HP). In March 2020, due to global efforts to combat the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, we announced a temporary pause in randomization of new patients in our Phase 3 trials. In June 2020, we announced that we had recommenced randomization of new patients in both of our Phase 3 trials. Despite the pause, we completed patient enrollment in PHALCON-EE in November 2020 and in PHALCON-HP in January 2021, and we expect to report top-line data from PHALCON-EE in the second half 2021 and from PHALCON-HP in the second quarter of 2021. We believe that the successful completion of our Phase 3 clinical trials, together with the existing clinical data, will support regulatory submissions in 2021 and 2022 for marketing approval for the treatment of H. pylori infection and erosive esophagitis, respectively. In August 2019, we received qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, and Fast Track designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for vonoprazan tablets in combination with amoxicillin tablets and clarithromycin tablets and with amoxicillin tablets alone, for the treatment of H. pylori infection. In November 2020, we requested additional QIDP and Fast Track designations to include amoxicillin capsules in addition to amoxicillin tablets. The FDA granted these additional Fast Track designations and advised us that the request for additional QIDP designations for these products remains under review. QIDP designation provides potential eligibility for priority review and extension of any regulatory exclusivity awarded, if approved. Vonoprazan has the potential to be the first gastric anti-secretory agent from a novel class approved in the United States, Europe, or Canada in over 30 years. 
 GERD and H. pylori infection are two of the most common acid-related GI diseases and impact millions of people. The prevalence of GERD is estimated to be 20% of the U.S. population and 15% of the population in the five major countries in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, or the EU5). GERD is a disease that develops when the reflux of acidic stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Approximately 30% of GERD patients have erosive esophagitis. H. pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects approximately 35% of the U.S. population and 45% of the EU5 population. As a result of the chronic inflammation induced by H. pylori infection, approximately 20% of infected patients will develop a range of pathologies, including dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. 
 Over the last thirty years, the proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, class, has been the standard of care for the treatment of acid-related GI diseases. PPIs are generally used as a single agent for the treatment of GERD and in combination with antibiotics for the treatment of H. pylori infection. The PPI class includes drugs such as Prilosec (omeprazole), Nexium (esomeprazole), and Prevacid (lansoprazole). Prior to the introduction of generic and over-the-counter, or OTC, alternatives, annual PPI class sales reached approximately $12.5 billion in the United States, and peak sales for individual brands were approximately $3.7 billion for Prilosec, $3.5 billion for Nexium, and $3.4 billion for Prevacid in the United States. 
 While PPIs are the current standard of care and have experienced significant commercial success, they have significant limitations that result in a large unmet medical need. In GERD, PPI therapy is suboptimal for many patients due to the slow onset and insufficient duration of acid control which can lead to inadequate symptom relief.

Approximately 15% to 45% of GERD patients remain inadequately treated with PPIs. In the treatment of H. pylori infection, the standard of care consists of a combination of a PPI and at least two oral antibiotics. However, increasing antibiotic resistance has resulted in declining eradication rates with PPI-based therapy. We believe these unmet medical needs are in part driven by limitations associated with the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of PPIs. 
 PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting active proton pumps expressed on the parietal cells. PPIs require activation by gastric acid, but they are unstable in the presence of acid. This instability, combined with the short circulating half-life of PPIs, limits their efficacy. Additionally, because proton pumps continuously switch between active and inactive states, multiple doses of PPIs are required to inhibit enough proton pumps to achieve a clinical benefit. As a result, PPIs have a relatively slow onset of action and limited potency and duration of effect, which may result in patients experiencing only partial relief, increasing PPI dosage, and/or cycling through multiple PPIs seeking relief. 
 Vonoprazan has a differentiated mechanism of action from PPIs. Unlike PPIs, vonoprazan: 
  
• | does not require activation by gastric acid;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | is stable in the presence of acid;
--+-----------------------------------


• | binds with a slow dissociation rate to both active and inactive proton pumps; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | has a long plasma half-life that replenishes the drug at the site of action over the course of the day.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These factors have enabled vonoprazan to demonstrate more rapid and potent acid suppression versus the PPI esomeprazole in human subjects two hours after oral dosing and maintain target acid inhibition over a 24-hour period in a randomized, open-label, crossover clinical trial. In contrast, PPIs require three to five days to reach steady state acid suppression and do not reliably maintain target acid inhibition over a 24-hour period. In addition, vonoprazan demonstrated approximately 10-to-100-fold better acid control compared to esomeprazole. 
 We believe that vonoprazan’s anti-secretory profile may demonstrate clinically meaningful advantages over PPIs, such as: 
  
• | faster, more complete, and more durable healing of erosive esophagitis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | faster, more complete, and more durable control of GERD symptoms;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | higher H. pylori eradication rates in combination with antibiotics compared to standard of care triple therapy and the potential for antibiotic-sparing dual therapy; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more flexible dosing, including dosing independent of food and time of day, and the potential for rapid symptom relief through on-demand dosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Vonoprazan has demonstrated clinical advantages over the PPI lansoprazole in the treatment of erosive esophagitis and H. pylori infection in completed Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in Japan and other Asian countries. 
 Erosive esophagitis.  In two Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in Japan assessing vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in the healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, vonoprazan met its primary endpoint in demonstrating non-inferiority to lansoprazole. In a post hoc analysis of the healing trial, vonoprazan demonstrated faster healing and a superior overall healing rate compared to lansoprazole in patients with more severe erosive esophagitis. After two weeks of treatment, 88% of erosive esophagitis patients with more severe disease were healed after treatment with vonoprazan versus 64% with lansoprazole (p=0.0008). In the maintenance of healing trial, vonoprazan demonstrated lower recurrence rates of erosive esophagitis six months after treatment versus lansoprazole across all grades of severity of erosive esophagitis. Vonoprazan achieved a 2% recurrence rate compared to 17% for lansoprazole (p<0.0001). 
 H. pylori.  A Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted in Japan assessing vonoprazan in combination with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin versus lansoprazole in combination with these same antibiotics in first line treatment of H. pylori infection. In this trial, the vonoprazan-based regimen met its primary endpoint in demonstrating a non-inferior eradication rate of 93% compared to 76% for lansoprazole-based regimen (p<0.0001) and was also superior in a post hoc analysis of this trial (p<0.0001). In patients who failed first line therapy,

vonoprazan in combination with the antibiotics metronidazole and amoxicillin demonstrated a 98% eradication rate as second line therapy. 
 A p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance, such that a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 or 0.01 means that there is a 5.0% or 1.0% or less probability, respectively, that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less typically represents a statistically significant result. 
 We have used this clinical experience to inform our Phase 3 clinical development program in these indications. 
 Our founders and management team have deep expertise in developing GI therapeutics, including anti-secretory agents, and direct experience developing vonoprazan at Takeda. Our Chairman, Tadataka (Tachi) Yamada, M.D., is the former Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Officer at Takeda. He is the former President of the American Gastroenterological Association and former Chief of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan.

Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to improve the lives of people suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Our strategy is initially focused on developing and commercializing vonoprazan as a potential first-in-class P-CAB in the United States, Europe, and Canada for the treatment of acid-related GI diseases. Key elements of this strategy include: 

• | Advance the clinical development of vonoprazan in erosive esophagitis and H. pylori infection and seek marketing approval. We believe we can leverage the existing clinical data and post-marketing experience, as well as our management team’s experience with vonoprazan, to advance vonoprazan through our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. We initiated single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of vonoprazan in each of erosive esophagitis and H. pylori infection in the fourth quarter of 2019. In November 2020, we completed enrollment in our erosive esophagitis trial, and expect to report top-line data from that trial in the second half of 2021. In January 2021, we completed enrollment in our H. pylori treatment trial, and expect to report top-line data from that trial in the second quarter of 2021. If the trials are successful, we anticipate submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval for the treatment of H. pylori infection in the second half of 2021 and for erosive esophagitis in the first half of 2022. If approved by the FDA as a new chemical entity, vonoprazan would receive a five-year period of marketing exclusivity within the United States and QIDP designation could extend the U.S. marketing exclusivity for an additional five years.

• | Commercialize vonoprazan in the United States. We plan to independently commercialize vonoprazan, if approved, in the United States by building a leading specialty gastroenterology commercial infrastructure to support the adoption of vonoprazan. We believe we can successfully launch vonoprazan in the United States with a focused specialty sales force targeting prescribers of treatments for H. pylori and GERD, particularly gastroenterologists. Prescriptions for treatments for H. pylori and GERD are both highly concentrated, with approximately 20% of physicians writing approximately 70% of the prescriptions for each of these conditions. We believe we have an opportunity to achieve significant share of voice and exposure to physicians given the scarcity of actively marketed anti-secretory medicines. Given the limitations of PPIs and current unmet need, we believe the commercial opportunity for vonoprazan is substantial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek commercial partnerships to maximize the vonoprazan opportunity outside of the United States. We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for vonoprazan in Europe and Canada. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more partners with existing commercial infrastructure and expertise in these markets. We believe this strategy will allow us to realize the value of the market opportunity in Europe and Canada while focusing our resources on the U.S. market. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the development of vonoprazan across indications, dosing regimens, and alternative formulations and packaging. Non-erosive reflux disease, or NERD, is a major subcategory of GERD and is characterized by reflux-related symptoms in the absence of esophageal mucosal erosions. We plan to pursue development of vonoprazan for NERD as both an on-demand and as a continuously dosed therapy for patients with NERD. We anticipate initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in mid-2021 evaluating various doses of vonoprazan as an on-demand therapy. Although we have not yet finalized the design of our Phase 3 NERD trials, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 development program evaluating vonoprazan as a continuous therapy for NERD, and, subject to the results from the Phase 2 trial, as an on-demand therapy. In addition to NERD, we plan to pursue vonoprazan lifecycle extension strategies in areas with clear unmet need, clinical rationale, and commercial justification. These strategies may include: (i) additional indications, including treatment of gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers, Barrett’s esophagus, and eosinophilic esophagitis; and (ii) alternative formulations and packaging, such as orally disintegrating tablets and other oral dosage forms for patients with difficulty swallowing, and an intravenous formulation for in-hospital applications. Additionally, we believe that vonoprazan has the ideal profile for an OTC product because of the potential for on-demand symptom relief and a well-tolerated safety profile.

 Acid-Related GI Diseases 
 Overview 
 Gastric acid is a digestive fluid formed in the stomach. The highly acidic environment of the stomach causes the unfolding, or denaturing, of food proteins that are subsequently broken down by gastric enzymes. Gastric acid is secreted by the hydrogen potassium ATPase enzyme, which is known as the proton pump. Proton pumps are expressed on the channeled surfaces, or canaliculi, of parietal cells in the stomach, which secrete acid. Proton pumps are continuously synthesized and switch between active and inactive states in response to various stimuli, such as food. When activated, proton pumps increase acid secretion. 
 GI diseases where treatment is related to acid control, such as GERD, peptic ulcer disease, Zollinger Ellison syndrome, and H. pylori infection, are significant medical problems because of their high prevalence, chronic nature and clinical sequelae. GERD results from the effects of acid on compromised mucosal defenses in the gastrointestinal tract. The reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus produces frequent and/or severe heartburn, indigestion, and reflux symptoms. Chronic GERD may damage esophageal tissue and progress to more severe diseases including erosive esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal cancer. GERD and related diseases are associated with impaired quality of life and substantial costs to the healthcare system given their chronic nature and sequelae. In H. pylori infection, gastric acid limits the effectiveness of antibiotics used to eradicate infection. Chronic H. pylori infection can lead to dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. 
 Prevalence 
 The prevalence of GI diseases is high. Approximately 20% to 40% of Western adults report chronic heartburn or regurgitation symptoms potentially related to GERD. We estimate that there are approximately 65 million individuals in the United States and 50 million individuals in the EU5 with GERD. In the United States, GERD is the most common gastroenterology-related outpatient diagnosis. Additionally, approximately 35% of the U.S. population and 45% of the EU5 population are infected with H. pylori. We estimate that there are approximately 115 million individuals in the United States and 145 million individuals in the EU5 infected with H. pylori. 
 Prevalence of GERD and H. pylori Infection
 

Treatments 
 Treatments of acid-related GI diseases aim to provide relief of acute symptoms, healing of damaged tissue, and prevention of long-term clinical sequelae associated with chronic acid exposure. Gastric acidity is measured by the pH scale, a logarithmic scale where 7.0 describes a neutral state and lower levels indicate a higher level of acidity. The pH of the stomach typically ranges from 1.5 to 3.5. In patients with acid-related GI diseases, increasing gastric pH has been shown to improve mucosal healing rates and provide more rapid symptom relief for patients. For example, the duration of time that intra-gastric acidity is greater than pH 3.0 correlates with the healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers, and pH greater than 4.0 is correlated with the healing of erosive esophagitis. Similarly,

in patients with H. pylori infection, a more neutral gastric pH of 5.0 to 7.6 preserves antibiotic function and is optimal for successful eradication. 
 Drug-induced gastric acid suppression is a key component of the management of acid-related GI diseases. Three classes of drugs with distinct mechanisms of action are principally used for treatment in the United States and Europe: antacids, histamine receptor antagonists, or H2RAs, and PPIs. 
 Antacids 
 Antacids, first commercially available in the 1930s, directly neutralize gastric acid to raise intra-gastric pH and can alleviate intermittent, mild symptoms of acid-related GI diseases, such as heartburn, but they are only effective for a short duration and require frequent administrations per day. In addition, antacids do not significantly help heal or prevent complications of acid-related diseases. Antacids include commonly-known OTC products, such as Alka-Seltzer, Pepto-Bismol, Rolaids, and TUMS. 
Histamine Receptor Antagonists (H2RAs) 
 H2RAs, first commercially available in the 1970s, decrease gastric acid secretion in order to raise gastric pH. H2RAs represented a dramatic improvement over antacids in the control of gastric acid and consequently in the management of acid-related GI diseases. H2RAs are also generally safe and well-tolerated. Among the H2RA class were the first commercial blockbuster drugs, Pepcid (famotidine), Tagamet (cimetidine), and Zantac (ranitidine). Zantac was the world’s highest-selling prescription drug in the mid-1990s, with peak global sales of $3.7 billion and U.S. sales of $2.2 billion. Prior to the launch of generic H2RAs and increasing competition from PPIs, the H2RA class achieved sales of approximately $3.5 billion in the United States. H2RAs achieved commercial success despite clinical limitations, including unreliable 24-hour acid control, poor control of post-meal symptoms, and loss of efficacy over time. 
Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) 
 PPIs, first commercially available in 1989, offered improved acid control over H2RAs. Pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that PPIs maintain gastric pH above target levels for a longer duration than H2RAs. A commonly used benchmark of anti-secretory activity is the percentage of time in a 24-hour period that gastric pH exceeds 4.0, which we refer to as time above pH 4.0, which ranges from 40% to 71% for PPIs versus 33% for H2RAs. 
 Given this improved pharmacodynamic profile, PPIs demonstrated improved clinical symptom relief and healing over H2RAs. In a meta-analysis of results from 33 randomized clinical trials with over 3,000 GERD patients, a reduction in symptoms was achieved in 83% of patients taking PPIs versus 60% of those on H2RAs. In a second meta-analysis, the eight-week healing rate in patients with erosive esophagitis was 82% for PPIs versus 52% for H2RAs. 
 The PPI class is currently the first-line treatment of acid-related GI diseases. Prior to the introduction and adoption of generic and OTC alternatives, annual PPI class sales reached approximately $12.5 billion in the United States, and peak sales for individual brands were approximately $3.7 billion for Prilosec, $3.5 billion for Nexium, and $3.4 billion for Prevacid. As recently as 2015, the last branded PPI, Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), reached approximately $530 million in sales in the United States despite limited differentiation from other PPIs. While Dexilant demonstrated a modest improvement in time above pH 4.0 compared to other PPIs, the approved dose did not demonstrate consistent superiority in Phase 3 trials against other PPIs on the healing of erosive esophagitis and has not been tested against PPIs in other indications. We believe that the commercial success of Dexilant highlights the value to physicians and patients of even incremental improvements over other PPIs.

History of Pharmaceutical Agents for Control of Gastric Acid
 

PPI Limitations 
 While PPIs provide clinically meaningful symptom relief and healing for millions of patients suffering from acid-related GI diseases, they are inadequate for many patients. The suboptimal anti-secretory profile of PPIs results in slow onset of symptom relief, breakthrough nighttime or postprandial heartburn, and treatment failure. A recent population-based survey with over 70,000 participants in the United States showed that 55% of patients who reported having GERD symptoms were taking PPIs, with 68% taking them daily, and 54% of daily PPI users reported persistent symptoms. This is consistent with earlier studies that have shown that approximately 15% to 45% of GERD patients are inadequately treated with PPIs, experiencing persistent, troublesome symptoms, such as heartburn and regurgitation. In approximately two-thirds of symptomatic GERD patients, reflux symptoms are not adequately controlled after the first dose of a PPI, and nearly 50% of patients still suffer from symptoms three days later. Given these limitations, more than 20% of GERD patients on PPI therapy take their PPI twice daily, which is not FDA approved, or purchase OTC heartburn treatments in addition to their prescription medicine. In a survey of approximately 1,000 GERD patients and 1,000 physicians, approximately one third of GERD patients reported persistent symptoms and were dissatisfied with PPI therapy and 35% of physicians perceived patients as somewhat satisfied to completely dissatisfied with PPI treatment. In addition, in July 2020, we conducted a U.S. market research study of 150 gastroenterologists and 152 primary care physicians who treat GERD. Of the surveyed physicians 38% reported their patients are not compliant on PPI therapy because they are not satisfied with efficacy.
 In patients with more severe grades of erosive esophagitis, studies with PPIs have reported failure rates of healing of esophageal erosions exceeding 25%. Additionally, recurrence of erosions is common in healed erosive esophagitis patients receiving maintenance PPI therapy. One study reported recurrence in 15% to 23% of patients with less severe erosive esophagitis and 24% to 41% of patients with more severe erosive esophagitis. We believe that these limitations of PPIs are in part driven by their mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics.

Mechanistic Differences Between PPIs and Vonoprazan 
 PPIs 
 After oral dosing, PPIs reach the gastric parietal cells through the bloodstream. PPIs are prodrugs that are converted to their active form in the acidic environment of the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell but degrade quickly because their active form is unstable in acid. For example, the half-life of omeprazole (Prilosec) is less than 10 minutes at pH 2.0. The active form of a PPI blocks acid production by covalently binding to active proton pumps that have moved to the surface of the secretory canaliculi after activation of the parietal cell with stimuli, such as a meal. Because PPIs bind only to actively secreting pumps, it is generally recommended that they be administered 30 to 60 minutes before a meal to achieve maximal efficacy. Once covalently bound to the proton pumps, the active PPI molecule is no longer available to bind to newly synthesized or activated proton pumps. Furthermore, given the relatively short plasma half-life of most PPIs of one to two hours, resupply of additional PPI molecules from the bloodstream is limited, and newly activated pumps are not inhibited. Due to this profile, PPI dosing over several days is required to inhibit enough proton pumps to increase gastric pH to a clinically meaningful threshold, and PPIs have a limited window of efficacy leading to incomplete acid suppression over the 24-hour dosing interval. In addition, PPIs are primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, an enzyme which has significant interpatient metabolic variability based on genotype. As a result, PPI exposure levels in some patients may not achieve target levels, potentially reducing clinical efficacy. 
Vonoprazan 
 Vonoprazan has a differentiated mechanism of action from PPIs. When vonoprazan reaches gastric parietal cells from the bloodstream, it accumulates in the secretory canaliculus where the proton pumps are present in their active state. In contrast to most PPIs, vonoprazan does not require gastric acid for activation, is stable in the presence of gastric acid, reversibly binds to proton pumps in both their inactive and active states, and remains in the secretory canaliculus where it continues to inhibit acid secretion over an extended period. Vonoprazan’s prolonged effect is also maintained through a slow dissociation rate from the proton pumps and resupply from the bloodstream due to its seven-hour half-life. These characteristics allow vonoprazan to rapidly achieve target 24-hour acid suppression within two hours of a single dose, unlike PPIs that require three to five days to achieve stable acid suppression. In addition, vonoprazan is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5, an enzyme which has less genetic variability than CYP2C19, and may exhibit more consistent activity than PPIs across U.S. and European populations. 
 The mechanistic and pharmacologic differences of PPIs and vonoprazan are summarized in the table below.

Vonoprazan Pharmacodynamics vs. PPIs 
 Vonoprazan’s more rapid, potent, and durable anti-secretory effects versus the PPI esomeprazole (Nexium) were demonstrated in a randomized, open-label, crossover clinical trial comparing 20 mg of once daily, or QD, vonoprazan to 20 mg QD of esomeprazole in 20 healthy volunteers. As shown below, vonoprazan achieved rapid and potent pH control on Day 1 relative to esomeprazole (left). Vonoprazan maintained pH approximately 1 to 2 units higher than esomeprazole at Day 7 (right), which represents a 10-to-100-fold reduction in acidity. 
 Improved Onset and Potency of pH Control of Vonoprazan vs. Esomeprazole at Day 1 and Day 7
 

This improved potency and duration of pH control with vonoprazan, as measured by time above pH 4.0, was evident not only at Day 1, but also at Day 7 when esomeprazole had reached its steady state (see table below). 
 Improved Time Above pH 4.0 of Vonoprazan vs. Esomeprazole at Day 1 and Day 7
 

Vonoprazan for the Potential Treatment of Acid-Related GI Diseases 
 Given the shortcomings of PPI therapy, we believe that there is a significant unmet medical need for a safe and effective anti-secretory agent with rapid, potent, and durable activity. Vonoprazan was developed in markets outside of the United States by Takeda through an extensive clinical program, including 19 Phase 3 clinical trials. As of December 2020, over 7,000 subjects were exposed to vonoprazan in completed and ongoing clinical trials. In head-to-head Phase 3 trials versus a PPI, vonoprazan demonstrated faster onset of healing in more severe erosive esophagitis patients, lower recurrence rates of erosions in erosive esophagitis patients across all levels of severity, and a superior eradication rate in combination with antibiotics in patients with H. pylori infection than PPI-based triple therapy. Vonoprazan received marketing approval in Japan in late 2014 and generated approximately $650 million in net sales in its fifth full year on the market in Japan. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of vonoprazan in each of erosive esophagitis and H. pylori infection. In March 2020, due to global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused randomization of new patients in our Phase 3 trial. Despite this pause, we completed enrollment of our erosive esophagitis trial in November 2020 and of our H. pylori trial in January 2021. We expect to report top-line data from our H. pylori trial in the second quarter of 2021, and our erosive esophagitis trial in the second half of 2021, and if successful, submit regulatory applications for

marketing approval for the treatment of H. pylori infection in the second half of 2021 and for erosive esophagitis in the first half of 2022. 
 Vonoprazan in GERD 
 Based on the significant unmet medical need, previous Phase 3 trial results, and commercial potential, we have prioritized the development of vonoprazan in GERD in: 
  
• | the healing of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn.

 We also plan to initiate our first Phase 2 trial in symptomatic non-erosive GERD, or NERD, in the second quarter of 2021.
 GERD Disease Overview 
 GERD is one of the most prevalent diseases of any kind and is the most prevalent GI disease, affecting approximately 20% of the U.S. population and approximately 15% of the European population. We estimate there are approximately 65 million individuals with GERD in the United States and 50 million individuals with GERD in the EU5. GERD is a disease that develops when the reflux of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications, and the term covers a spectrum of diseases, the main categories of which are erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease. These diseases are detailed below: 

• | Erosive esophagitis: Approximately 30% of GERD patients have erosive esophagitis, which is classified by erosions in the gastric mucosa caused by acidic reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. Erosive esophagitis is commonly graded by the Los Angeles classification system, which characterizes the extent of erosions in the esophagus and is graded on a scale of increasing severity from A to D, with D being the most severe. Approximately 20% to 30% of erosive esophagitis patients have the more severe Los Angeles Class C or D disease. Erosive esophagitis can have serious consequences. If left untreated, esophagitis may develop into peptic stricture, Barrett’s esophagus or esophageal cancer.

• | Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD): Approximately 70% of GERD patients have NERD, which is classified by an endoscopically normal esophagus, but abnormal gastric acid exposure in the esophagus and persistent symptoms. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

GERD patients typically present with heartburn and reflux symptoms. Based on these symptoms, patients are typically treated first-line with PPIs prior to a diagnostic endoscopy for specific disease classification of erosive esophagitis or NERD. Clinical guidelines suggest that endoscopy be performed in patients who continue to have symptoms despite a four- to-eight-week course of daily PPIs or have alarm symptoms, including GI bleeding, anemia, weight loss, chest pain, or difficult or painful swallowing. Our market research suggests that most patients are treated empirically based on symptoms rather than based on endoscopic characterization of disease.

GERD Treatment Paradigm 
 Approximately 80% of GERD patients are pharmacologically treated with prescription or OTC medications. PPIs are currently the most effective anti-secretory agents available in the United States and Europe for relieving GERD symptoms and healing erosions in gastric mucosa. Our market research suggests that approximately 80% of patients who are pharmacologically treated receive PPIs, and more than 80% of PPI use is prescription rather than OTC. The majority of PPI use is chronic, with more than 70% of patients prescribed PPIs for daily use. According to IQVIA NDTI, there were approximately 6.8 billion PPI doses prescribed for the 12 months ended October 31, 2020. 
 There are few treatment options for GERD patients who are inadequately managed on PPI therapy. Our U.S. market research survey reported that 26% of patients who are unsatisfied with therapy on a given PPI will switch to a different PPI to improve symptom control or heal esophageal erosions; however, physicians surveyed did not believe there are meaningful differences in outcomes between PPIs. Even though safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing of PPIs has not been evaluated in large controlled clinical studies and is not included on the label for any PPIs, surveyed physicians reported that 23% of patients resort to this dosing regimen given dissatisfaction of once daily PPIs. A limited number of patients proceed to a surgical procedure, such as Nissen fundoplication. However, this procedure results in postoperative morbidity of 5% to 20%, as well as a two- to six-week recovery period and a median hospital stay of two days. 
 Vonoprazan has the potential to be the first gastric anti-secretory agent from a novel class approved in the United States, Europe, or Canada in over 30 years. Our U.S. market research survey reported that 55% to 60% of physicians believed that vonoprazan has demonstrated superior efficacy in the healing and maintenance of healed esophageal erosions compared to existing EE treatments, provides faster onset of action compared to existing GERD treatments, and has superior duration and magnitude of gastric pH control compared to existing GERD treatments. 
 Clinical Data for Vonoprazan in GERD 
 Four Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed comparing vonoprazan to PPIs in erosive esophagitis: a healing trial in Japan; a maintenance of healing trial in Japan; a healing trial in Asia (China, Taiwan, and Korea); and a maintenance of healing trial in Asia. In addition to these Phase 3 trials, several published investigator-sponsored studies have compared vonoprazan to PPIs across dosing regimens and endpoints. Results of these clinical trials are summarized below. 
 Healing of Erosive Esophagitis Clinical Trials in Japan and Asia 
 In a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial, 409 patients in Japan with endoscopically confirmed erosive esophagitis were randomized to receive vonoprazan 20 mg QD or lansoprazole 30 mg QD for up to eight weeks. The primary endpoint was the non-inferiority of the percent of patients with healed erosive esophagitis up to Week 8, as assessed by endoscopy. Non-inferiority is intended to show that the effect of a new treatment is not worse than the active control by more than a specified margin, while superiority is intended to show that one treatment is more effective than a comparator by any margin. 
Design of Japan Phase 3 Clinical Trial for the Healing of Erosive Esophagitis
 

Vonoprazan achieved the primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus lansoprazole on the percent of patients with healed erosive esophagitis up to Week 8 (99% vs. 96%, p<0.0001). Further, a post hoc analysis demonstrated

that vonoprazan was superior to lansoprazole on the percent of patients with healed erosive esophagitis up to Week 8 (p=0.0337). In the subset of 147 patients with more severe erosive esophagitis of Los Angeles Class C or D, vonoprazan healing was also shown to be superior (99% vs. 88%, p=0.0082). We believe this result is due to the improved acid control of vonoprazan over lansoprazole, and we believe lansoprazole is representative of the PPI class.
 Vonoprazan further demonstrated a more rapid clinical effect versus lansoprazole with a superior healing rate at Week 2 (91% vs. 82%, p<0.0001 for non-inferiority and p=0.0132 in a post hoc superiority analysis). The treatment effect was more pronounced in the more severe patients with Los Angeles Class C or D disease (88% vs. 64%, p=0.0008 for superiority). Of the seven patients who failed lansoprazole treatment and continued into the additional treatment period, six healed with four weeks of treatment of 40 mg vonoprazan QD. 
 Results of Japan Phase 3 Clinical Trial in the Healing of Erosive Esophagitis
 

In addition, in the lead-in period of the Japan Phase 3 maintenance of healing clinical trial discussed below, patients were treated with vonoprazan 20 mg for up to eight weeks before proceeding into treatment for the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. The healing rate at Week 2 and through Week 8 during this lead-in healing period was 91% and 99%, respectively. 
 In a second multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Korea, 703 patients with healed erosive esophagitis, 20.6% of whom had Los Angeles Grade C or D disease prior to EE healing, were randomized to receive vonoprazan 10 mg QD, vonoprazan 20 mg QD, or lansoprazole 15 mg QD for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent of patients with recurrence of erosive esophagitis at Week 24 as assessed by endoscopy. Recurrence rates were 25.5% for lansoprazole 15 mg QD, 13.3% for vonoprazan 10 mg QD, and 12.3% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD. Both doses of vonoprazan were superior to lansoprazole in preventing endoscopic recurrence (95% confidence interval of treatment difference of -20.3% to -4.3% for vonoprazan 10mg QD as compared to lansoprazole 15mg QD and -21.3% to -5.3% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD as compared to lansoprazole 15mg QD. Among Los Angeles Grade C or D patients, recurrence rates were 41.7% for lansoprazole 15 mg QD, 28.2% for vonoprazan 10 mg QD, and 12.5% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD. The 20 mg dose of vonoprazan was superior to lansoprazole in preventing endoscopic recurrence in Grade C or D patients (95% confidence interval of treatment difference of -48.9% to -9.4% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD as compared to lansoprazole 15mg QD).  
 Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis Clinical Trials in Japan and Asia 
 In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial in Japan, 627 patients with erosive esophagitis were treated with vonoprazan 20 mg QD for two, four, or eight weeks. After this lead-in period, a total of 607 patients with healed erosive esophagitis, of whom 124 had Los Angeles Class C or D disease, were randomized to receive vonoprazan 10 mg QD, vonoprazan 20 mg QD, or lansoprazole 15 mg QD for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent of patients with recurrence of erosive esophagitis at Week 24 as assessed by endoscopy.

Design of Japan Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis
 

Vonoprazan achieved the primary endpoint of non-inferiority versus lansoprazole on the percent of patients with recurrence of erosive esophagitis during the 24-week maintenance period. Patients on lansoprazole had a 17% recurrence rate of erosive esophagitis after 24 weeks of daily treatment, versus 5% for patients on vonoprazan 10 mg and 2% for patients on vonoprazan 20 mg (p<0.0001 for non-inferiority of both vonoprazan doses vs. lansoprazole). Both vonoprazan doses were superior to lansoprazole in a post hoc analysis (p=0.0002 for vonoprazan 10 mg and p<0.0001 for vonoprazan 20 mg). As shown below, the superiority of each dose of vonoprazan to lansoprazole was demonstrated in both Los Angeles Class A and B patients, as well as the more severe Los Angeles Class C and D patients. We believe this result demonstrates the improved potency and durability of vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in all patients with erosive esophagitis. 
Results of Japan Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis
 

In a second multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial in China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Korea, patients with healed erosive esophagitis, 20.6% of whom had Los Angeles Class C or D disease prior to EE healing, were randomized to receive vonoprazan 10 mg QD, vonoprazan 20 mg QD, or lansoprazole 15 mg QD for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent of patients with recurrence of erosive esophagitis at Week 24 as assessed by endoscopy. Recurrence rates were 25.5% for lansoprazole 15 mg QD, 13.3% for vonoprazan 10 mg QD, and 12.3% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD. Both doses of vonoprazan were superior to lansoprazole in preventing endoscopic recurrence (95% confidence interval of treatment difference of -20.3% to -4.3% for vonoprazan 10mg QD as compared to lansoprazole 15mg QD and -21.3% to -5.3% for vonoprazan 20 mg QD as compared to lansoprazole 15mg QD).
Symptom Relief 
 We believe the rapid pharmacodynamic effects of vonoprazan may provide complete and sustained heartburn relief more quickly compared to PPIs. A double-blind, randomized, investigator-sponsored clinical trial in 32 

16
--

 
patients with erosive esophagitis compared the effects of vonoprazan 20 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg on the time to achieve complete heartburn relief, defined as seven days without heartburn symptoms. Vonoprazan demonstrated a faster time to complete heartburn relief than lansoprazole, and this complete relief was most pronounced for nighttime heartburn. The results of the trial are summarized below. We plan to evaluate a similar endpoint in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial. 
 Faster Onset and Higher Rate of Complete Heartburn Relief
 

Our Erosive Esophagitis Phase 3 Program 
 We initiated PHALCON-EE, a single Phase 3 clinical trial of vonoprazan to assess the healing of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn, and the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and relief of heartburn in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our investigational new drug, or IND, application for vonoprazan in erosive esophagitis was accepted by the FDA in September 2019. 
 We have enrolled over 1,000 patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive esophagitis in this clinical trial, of which the more severe patients, Los Angeles Class C or D patients were targeted to comprise 30% of the subjects. The clinical trial has both a healing phase and a maintenance phase. As patients are re-randomized between the healing phase and the maintenance phase, each phase will be analyzed independently and have independent primary and secondary endpoints.  
  
• | Healing phase: During the healing phase, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either vonoprazan 20 mg QD or lansoprazole 30 mg QD for up to eight weeks. The lansoprazole 30 mg QD dose is recommended in the FDA prescribing information for lansoprazole. The primary endpoint for this phase is the percentage of patients with complete healing of erosive esophagitis by Week 8 as assessed by endoscopy with a primary analysis of non-inferiority. Key secondary endpoints include: the percentage of patients with complete healing of erosive esophagitis at Week 2; percentage of patients with Los Angeles Class C or D erosive esophagitis disease with complete healing at Week 2 and Week 8; percentage of patients with onset of sustained heartburn relief by Day 3 of treatment; and the percentage of 24-hour heartburn free days over the healing phase.

• | Maintenance phase: Patients with complete healing of erosive esophagitis at Week 2 or Week 8 in the healing phase are re-randomized 1:1:1 into the maintenance phase. During this phase, patients receive either vonoprazan 10 mg QD, vonoprazan 20 mg QD, or lansoprazole 15 mg QD for 24 weeks. The lansoprazole 15 mg QD dose is recommended in the FDA prescribing information for the maintenance of healing indication. The primary endpoint for this phase is the percentage of patients who maintain complete healing after 24 weeks as assessed by endoscopy with a primary analysis of non-inferiority. If non-inferiority is demonstrated, then an analysis for superiority will also be performed. Key secondary endpoints include the percentage of patients with Los Angeles Class C or D erosive esophagitis disease who maintain complete healing after 24 weeks and the percentage of 24-hour heartburn free days over the maintenance phase.

 Our Phase 3 trial design is modeled after the successful Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in Japan and Asia with limited differences other than combining both the healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis into a single study. In Japan and Asia, separate clinical trials were conducted for each of these indications. We believe we can simplify patient recruitment by conducting a single clinical trial and re-randomizing patients between phases. 
 Design for PHALCON-EE Phase 3 Erosive Esophagitis Clinical Trial
 

We expect to report top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2021 and, if successful, file a regulatory submission for marketing approval in the first half of 2022. 
Our Development Program in Symptomatic Non-Erosive Reflux Disease (NERD)
 We believe that there is opportunity to broadly position vonoprazan’s use in GERD with an indication in symptomatic NERD, in addition to an indication in erosive esophagitis. We plan to develop vonoprazan in NERD with both daily and on-demand, or as-needed, dosing regimens. NERD patients do not have esophageal erosions which require chronic treatment to prevent recurrence of erosions and its potential sequelae. We believe the rapid onset of action of vonoprazan may enable on-demand use for the management of heartburn in NERD patients as an alternative to chronic daily treatment with PPIs. 
 Takeda conducted two Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trials with vonoprazan in Japanese patients with endoscopically confirmed NERD. In the first clinical trial, vonoprazan demonstrated a significant reduction in symptom severity versus placebo (p=0.0139), and in the second trial, vonoprazan demonstrated a faster onset of symptom relief versus placebo (p=0.0003). However, the studies did not show a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint of proportion of days over a 4-week period without heartburn between vonoprazan and placebo (p=0.0504 and p=0.0643). We believe that the design of these trials may have contributed to their results. For example, the first trial, which studied vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg, included a 1-week single blind antacid run-in period where patients were instructed to take antacids after each meal, 3 times per day. Only those patients who did not respond to the antacid treatment were randomized into the double-blind portion of the trial. We believe this design unintentionally enriched the study with patients with non-acid related, or functional disease. In contrast, none of the PPI placebo-controlled continuous dosing studies that were used for U.S. registration employed an antacid run-in period. A high number of subjects suffering from functional heartburn might explain the unusually low response rates seen in this trial both for placebo (7%) and the vonoprazan test regimens

(10-12%). In addition, nearly 40% of all patients in this study did not experience a single heartburn free day during the 4 weeks of the study, which in our view is suggestive of a highly prevalent functional heartburn patient population. 
 In the second study, the single-blind run-in period was changed to be a placebo run-in, where responders would not be eligible for double-blind period; added a specific exclusion criterion for functional heartburn; reduced the diary collection period from twice daily to once daily; and dropped the 20 mg dose choosing to study the 10 mg dose. In contrast to the first study, this study produced historically high placebo response rate (62%). Nevertheless, the data in this study show a clearer benefit of vonoprazan (73%) over placebo than the first study. While the primary endpoint of heartburn free days missed significance (p= 0.0643) due to the high placebo response, we believe this study shows that vonoprazan demonstrates improvement in NERD compared to placebo. We believe that reducing the diary to once daily may have contributed to a higher placebo response, and that not including the 20 mg dose prevented this trial from having its best chance at succeeding.
 The Japanese PPI NERD trials have generally seen higher placebo response rates and reduced effect sizes than the U.S. PPI NERD counterpart studies. We think this is related to regional variations in identifying true heartburn over other GI related symptoms. Accordingly, we have decided to conduct our initial NERD study only at sites located in the United States.
 In a Phase 2 clinical trial in European patients with NERD who were partial responders to high dose PPIs, vonoprazan did not demonstrate superiority versus esomeprazole in the primary endpoint of the percentage of heartburn free days over the four-week treatment period. As was the case with the NERD trials conducted by Takeda in Japanese patients, we believe this result may have been due to inclusion of patients with GI disorders unrelated to acid. 
 

On-Demand Dosing 
 We believe the rapid onset of action of vonoprazan may enable on-demand, or as needed, use for the relief of symptoms as an alternative to chronic daily treatment in NERD. In an open-label, investigator-sponsored clinical trial in Japan in NERD, the effectiveness of vonoprazan as an on-demand therapy was compared to that of daily PPI therapy with a number of different PPIs. In this clinical trial, patients utilized approximately 80% fewer doses of vonoprazan compared to PPIs but demonstrated similar levels of patient satisfaction. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating vonoprazan in on-demand treatment of NERD in the second quarter of 2021. The clinical objective of this dosing approach is rapid relief of an active heartburn episode that also lasts a minimum of a full day. In our NERD studies, we plan to emphasize the exclusion of confirmed or suspected functional heartburn patients. For this Phase 2 study, this will be further enhanced by using a 4-week vonoprazan run-in period and randomizing responders to the double-blind period. In addition, our Phase 2 on-demand study will evaluate a range of doses in

order to determine the lowest effective dose that achieves the most rapid and durable relief. We also plan to employ modern digital diary collection tools.
 Design for Phase 2 NERD Clinical Trial
 

We expect to report topline date from this clinical trial in the first half of 2022.  
 
Continuous Dosing
 We also plan on conducting a Phase 3 study evaluating vonoprazan continuous, or daily, dosing for the treatment of NERD. Our plans are to explore both vonoprazan10 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase 3 continuous dosing study, like our ongoing Phase 3 study in erosive esophagitis. Although we have not yet finalized the design of our Phase 3 NERD trials, we anticipate the primary endpoint of this trial will be the percentage of twenty-four-hour heartburn-free days, which is the same endpoint used in Phase 3 trials for PPIs that are approved for the treatment of NERD.
 
Vonoprazan in Combination with Antibiotics for the Treatment of H. pylori Infection 
 Disease Burden and Outcomes 
 H. pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects approximately 35% of the U.S. population and 45% of the EU5 population. We estimate that there are approximately 115 million individuals in the United States and 145 million individuals in the EU5 infected with H. pylori, and we believe there are approximately 2.5 million patients treated for H. pylori infection in the United States each year. As a result of the chronic inflammation induced by H. pylori infection, approximately 20% of infected patients develop a range of pathologies including dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and over 80% of gastric cancers are attributed to H. pylori infection. Globally there are more than one million new cases of gastric cancer and approximately 782,000 deaths each year. Eradication of H. pylori infection has been proven to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, and the American College of Gastroenterologists, or ACG, guidelines recommend treatment for all patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection. 
 H. pylori eradication rates from the 1990s have fallen to current rates of <80% due to increasing antibiotic resistance. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed H. pylori among the 16 antibiotic-resistant bacteria that pose the greatest threat to human health and designated H. pylori as a Class 1 carcinogen, meaning that it is a definite known cause of cancer. In 2014, the FDA added H. pylori to the agency’s list of qualifying pathogens that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health under the GAIN Act. We believe that vonoprazan-based treatment regimens have the potential to restore eradication rates to their original rates in the United States and Europe given the clinical and post-marketing experience in the Japanese market.

A recent study compiled real-world health insurance claims data in Japan from 2008 to 2016 for H. pylori eradication. Prior to vonoprazan’s approval in late 2014, the H. pylori eradication rate across Japan fell to below 80% as shown in the figure below. Approximately one year after vonoprazan’s launch, the eradication rate increased to greater than 85%. From January 2015 to March 2016, the eradication rate with PPI-containing regimens in Japan was between 78% and 82% while the eradication rate with vonoprazan-containing regimens was 91% across all claims in this analysis. 
 Eradication Rate of H. pylori Infection in Japan Before and After Launch of Vonoprazan
 

In Japan, vonoprazan-containing regimens have become the most common first line treatment. One-year post launch, approximately 80% of all treated H. pylori-infected patients received vonoprazan-based regimens.
 Current Treatment Paradigm in the United States and Europe 
 The ACG treatment guidelines for H. pylori infection recommend using PPIs in conjunction with antibiotics to improve antibiotic efficacy against H. pylori infection. The use of anti-secretory agents enhances the effect of antibiotics in two ways. First, anti-secretory agents increase gastric pH, which in turn increases the stability of the antibiotics. For example, amoxicillin and clarithromycin are chemically unstable at the low pH typically found in the human stomach. Second, several antibiotics, including amoxicillin and clarithromycin, are most potent against H. pylori at the time of maximum bacterial replication, which occurs at pH 6.0 to 7.0. H. pylori is in a dormant state at lower pH values, which reduces the effectiveness of the antibiotics. 
 The table below shows the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotic required to eradicate 90% of H. pylori in vitro, or MIC90. As pH increases, the amount of antibiotic required for 90% eradication decreases substantially.

A triple therapy regimen (PPI, clarithromycin, and either amoxicillin or metronidazole) is the regimen most commonly used in clinical practice for the first-line treatment of H. pylori infection. However, H. pylori eradication rates with PPI triple therapy in the 1990s have fallen to current levels of <80%, primarily due to increased resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole. A recent meta-analysis indicates that U.S. resistance rates measured from 2012 to 2016 were 20% for clarithromycin, 29% for metronidazole, and 19% for levofloxacin. These figures represent a marked increase from 2009 to 2011 for both clarithromycin and metronidazole, for which resistance was 9% for clarithromycin, 21% for metronidazole, and 11% for levofloxacin. H. pylori resistance to amoxicillin remains low despite its use in most triple therapy regimens; resistance is generally <2% among isolates in the United States and Europe. There is a similar trend of increasing resistance to key antibiotics in Europe. 
 Given the declining eradication rates for H. pylori, quadruple therapy is recommended as first-line treatment in areas with known high rates of clarithromycin or metronidazole resistance; however, our U.S. market research study reported that physicians prescribe quadruple therapy to only 17% of first-line patients. Due predominantly to considerations of convenience and patient compliance, approximately 80% physicians surveyed in our market research expressed a preference for convenience, or combination packs compared to individual bottles for both dual and triple therapy. Further, geographic patterns of resistance in the United States are poorly understood and treatment is largely empiric, with susceptibility testing rarely conducted prior to first-line treatment. Our U.S. market research study reported that only 8% and 16% of physicians conduct resistance testing prior to prescribing treatment for first-line and second-line H. pylori infection, respectively. 
 In our U.S. market research study, physicians highlighted the need for more effective and simpler first-line treatment options. For the treatment of H. pylori infection, surveyed physicians highlighted the need for improved eradication rates and more convenient dosing as key unmet needs. Over 50% of surveyed physicians agreed that vonoprazan dual or triple therapy provided a superior eradication rate in patients with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, and, on average, 48% and 47% reported a preference to use vonoprazan first line in patients with H. pylori infection, and patients with refractory H. pylori infection, respectively. 
 Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Japan of Vonoprazan in Combination with Antibiotics to Treat H. pylori Infection 
 A randomized, double-blind, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial in H. pylori-positive patients was completed in Japan. Patients with H. pylori infection and a history of gastric or duodenal ulcer who had not previously received H. pylori treatment were eligible for inclusion in the clinical trial. A total of 650 patients were randomized to receive seven days of: 
  
• | vonoprazan triple therapy: vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily, or BID, amoxicillin 750 mg BID, and clarithromycin (200 mg or 400 mg) BID; or

• | lansoprazole triple therapy: lansoprazole 30 mg BID, amoxicillin 750 mg BID, and clarithromycin (200 mg or 400 mg) BID.

Patients who did not achieve H. pylori eradication after first-line treatment received a second-line regimen of vonoprazan 20 mg BID, amoxicillin 750 mg BID, and metronidazole 250 mg BID for seven days. 
 Design of Japan Phase 3 H. pylori Treatment Clinical Trial
 

The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was confirmed H. pylori eradication determined by 13C-urea breath test, a standard test for the diagnosis of H. pylori, four weeks after the completion of treatment. The primary analysis was non-inferiority, and key secondary endpoints included the second line eradication rate and eradication rate in antibiotic-resistant subgroups. 
 Vonoprazan-based triple therapy demonstrated a non-inferior eradication rate of 93% compared to 76% for lansoprazole-based triple therapy (p<0.0001). Post hoc analyses indicated that vonoprazan-based triple therapy was superior to lansoprazole-based triple therapy (p<0.0001). Patients who were not eradicated on vonoprazan-based triple therapy or lansoprazole-based triple therapy were treated with a triple therapy regimen of vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. In this second-line setting, the H. pylori eradication rate with vonoprazan triple therapy was 98%. Across first- and second-line patients, the H. pylori eradication rate in clarithromycin resistant strains was higher with vonoprazan-based triple therapy (82%) than with lansoprazole-based triple therapy (40%) as shown below. We believe that this result is significant, as H. pylori antibiotic resistance testing is rare in the United States, and H. pylori treatment is generally empiric.

Other Studies of Vonoprazan in H. pylori Treatment 
 A meta-analysis of 14 studies in Japan with over 14,636 patients found that the pooled eradication rates of vonoprazan-containing regimens were superior to those of PPI-containing regimens in a first-line setting (85% vs. 68%, p<0.00001). Subgroup analysis further indicated the superiority of vonoprazan in patients with either clarithromycin-resistant strains (82% vs. 41%, p<0.00001) or clarithromycin-susceptible strains (95% vs 90%, p=0.006). A second study retrospectively confirmed that empiric vonoprazan-based triple therapy was non-inferior to PPI-based triple therapy based on H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility testing. 
 In addition to demonstrating superiority to PPIs in triple therapy regimens, vonoprazan was studied in a dual therapy regimen with amoxicillin in three investigator-initiated clinical trials in Japan. 
 The first trial involving 67 Japanese patients assessed vonoprazan dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID in combination with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily, or TID, for seven days) compared to vonoprazan triple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID in combination with amoxicillin 750 mg BID and clarithromycin 200 mg BID for seven days). As shown below, vonoprazan dual therapy was similarly efficacious to vonoprazan triple therapy (eradication rates of 94% in both treatment arms). 
 Results of Vonoprazan Dual and Triple Therapy in the Treatment of H. pylori Infection
 

A second clinical trial compared vonoprazan-based dual therapy to esomeprazole or rabeprazole PPI-based triple therapy. This clinical trial enrolled 81 Japanese patients including 40 first-line treatment patients and 41 second-line treatment patients who had failed standard therapy and compared vonoprazan dual therapy and PPI triple therapy in both first- and second-line therapy. Patients assigned to vonoprazan dual therapy were treated with vonoprazan 20 mg BID in combination with amoxicillin 500 mg TID for seven days. Patients assigned to PPI triple therapy were treated first-line with esomeprazole 20 mg or rabeprazole 10 mg BID, amoxicillin 750 mg BID, and clarithromycin 200 mg BID or second-line with esomeprazole 20 mg or rabeprazole 10 mg BID, amoxicillin 750 mg BID, and metronidazole 250 mg BID for seven days. As shown below, dual therapy with vonoprazan was efficacious in both first- and second-line therapy with eradication rates of 95% and 90%, respectively, versus 81% and 85% for PPI-based triple therapies.

Results of Vonoprazan Dual and PPI Triple Therapy in the Treatment of H. pylori Infection
 

Most recently, a third clinical trial assessed vonoprazan dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID in combination with amoxicillin 750 mg BID) compared to vonoprazan triple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg BID in combination with amoxicillin 750 mg BID and clarithromycin 200 mg BID) for seven days. This randomized and multi-center clinical trial included 335 patients. Vonoprazan dual therapy demonstrated a similar eradication rate to vonoprazan triple therapy (85% and 89%, respectively). Efficacy of vonoprazan dual therapy was maintained in subjects with clarithromycin-resistant infection (92% eradication rate in the dual therapy arm).
 
Antibiotic resistance is a significant clinical issue, and we believe that vonoprazan has the potential to address the growing resistance to H. pylori by eradicating infection after first-line of treatment. Vonoprazan dual therapy has further potential for improved convenience and compliance over triple or quadruple therapy regimens, and importantly, spares the use of clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, representing an opportunity both for effective treatment and sound antibiotic stewardship through the avoidance of additional antibiotics to which H. pylori is known to acquire resistance. Less frequent use of these antibiotics, which have important roles aside from the treatment of H. pylori infection, may help to limit the spread of resistance among other pathogenic bacteria within populations. 
 Our H. pylori Phase 3 Program 
 We initiated PHALCON-HP, a Phase 3 clinical trial of vonoprazan for the treatment of H. pylori infection in the fourth quarter of 2019, and completed enrollment in January 2021. We have enrolled over 975 patients with H. pylori infection as assessed by 13C-urea breath test in this clinical trial. The clinical trial will compare vonoprazan dual therapy and vonoprazan triple therapy regimens each head-to-head with a standard of care lansoprazole triple therapy regimen. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 manner into the three treatment arms as follows:  

• | vonoprazan dual therapy: vonoprazan 20 mg BID and amoxicillin 1 g TID for 14 days; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | vonoprazan triple therapy: vonoprazan 20 mg BID, amoxicillin 1 g BID and clarithromycin 500 mg BID for 14 days; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PPI triple therapy: lansoprazole 30 mg BID, amoxicillin 1 g BID and clarithromycin 500 mg BID for 14 days. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


25
--

 
The primary endpoint for this trial is the percentage of patients with successful eradication of H. pylori infection as assessed by 13C-urea breath test four weeks after completion of treatment. The primary analysis will assess the non-inferiority of vonoprazan dual therapy to lansoprazole triple therapy and vonoprazan triple therapy to lansoprazole triple therapy excluding patients who have H. pylori infection that is resistant to clarithromycin or amoxicillin. We will also conduct secondary analyses for superiority in all patients regardless of antibiotic resistance and in patients with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori infection. 
 Our Phase 3 trial design is modeled after the successful Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Japan. Key differences include: 
  
• | Inclusion of patients with H. pylori infection and dyspeptic symptoms. Our clinical trial will enroll patients with active H. pylori infection and dyspeptic symptoms. The Japan Phase 3 trial enrolled patients with H. pylori infection and a history of gastric or duodenal ulcers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment duration and antibiotic doses. Standard of care regimens in Western countries include higher doses of antibiotics and a longer duration of treatment (typically 14 days) than in Japan (typically seven days); and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inclusion of dual therapy arm. Vonoprazan dual therapy has only been studied in investigator-initiated clinical trials and not yet in a pivotal trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our clinical trial design conforms to standard of care treatment regimens in the United States and Europe and follows the ACG treatment guidelines. 
 Design for PHALCON-HP Phase 3 H. pylori Clinical Trial
 

We expect to report top-line data from this trial in the second quarter of 2021 and, if successful, file a regulatory submission for marketing approval in the second half of 2021. 
 Convenience Pack for H. pylori.
 We plan initially to seek regulatory approval for vonoprazan for the treatment of H. pylori infection as a pre-packaged convenience or combination pack with either clarithromycin and amoxicillin or amoxicillin alone. Convenience packs have the potential to improve patient adherence and treatment outcomes, and we believe there is a meaningful market opportunity for such a product. In the United States, PrevPac was formerly marketed as a pre-packaged convenience pack of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin and achieved peak sales of $150 million. In Japan, vonoprazan is marketed both as a stand-alone medicine as well as in pre-packaged convenience packs with either clarithromycin and amoxicillin (Vonosap) or metronidazole and amoxicillin (Vonopion).

Vonoprazan Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Japanese vs. non-Japanese Subjects 
 The vonoprazan pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile is similar between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects as assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers. Sixty Japanese subjects in the first study and 48 non-Japanese subjects in the second study, of whom 85% were Caucasian, received doses from 10 mg up to 40 mg QD for seven consecutive days. At all doses, pharmacokinetics between the two populations were similar. In addition, the pharmacodynamics were similar between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects as shown in the figure below. On Day 7, mean time above pH 4.0 for vonoprazan 20 mg QD was 83% for Japanese subjects and 85% for non-Japanese subjects. Night-time 12-hour time above pH 4.0 was 73% for Japanese subjects and 75% for non-Japanese subjects. We believe that these results show that vonoprazan has a similar profile in Japanese and non-Japanese subjects. 
 Comparative Pharmacodynamics of Vonoprazan in Japanese and non-Japanese Subjects
 

Summary of Vonoprazan Safety Data 
 Safety in Clinical Studies 
 As of December 2020, over 7,000 subjects have been exposed to vonoprazan in completed and ongoing Phase 1 to 3 clinical trials. The doses studied have ranged from 1 to 120 mg with durations up to one year. The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, in the clinical development program for vonoprazan, as reflected in the Japanese prescribing information published by Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, were diarrhea, constipation, nausea, elevated liver enzymes, rash, and eosinophilia. All such events had an incidence rate of less than 5.0% other than diarrhea in the treatment of H. pylori, which had an incidence rate of 10.6% in combination with antibiotics. No dose-related increase in treatment-emergent AEs, or TEAEs, or serious AEs was observed. The safety profile of vonoprazan and incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation were similar between vonoprazan and lansoprazole across studies. 
 Certain earlier generation P-CABs previously under development by other companies may have been discontinued in-part due to their hepatic safety profile. These hepatic safety concerns may be compound-specific and not generalizable to the P-CAB class. It is notable that vonoprazan is based on a pyrrole chemical structure and is chemically distinct from previously discontinued P-CABs that were based on an imidazole structure. Vonoprazan has had a similar hepatic safety profile to lansoprazole across all clinical studies conducted by Takeda, in which 1.0% of subjects treated with vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg and 0.8% of subjects treated with lansoprazole 15 mg or 30 mg had ALT or AST elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal or bilirubin elevations greater than two times the upper limit of normal. 
 Vonoprazan Post-Marketing Safety in Japan and Asia
 The most recent post-marketing safety report from December 2020 includes an estimate of over 50 million patients who have received vonoprazan in Japan and other countries in Asia since its launch. Based on the post-marketing experience, the clinically significant adverse reactions section of the Japanese prescribing information for vonoprazan was updated to include shock, anaphylaxis, hepatic impairment, skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme; and events of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The incidence of these reactions was considered extremely rare (less than 1

in 100,000 patients) and a causal relationship to vonoprazan could not be ruled out. Although serious hepatic adverse events have been observed among patients exposed to vonoprazan in Japan in the post-marketing setting, these cases were typically confounded by comorbidities or other concomitant medications and believed to be idiosyncratic reactions. Post-marketing safety data, including the December 2020 post-marketing safety report, has been submitted to the PMDA.
Vonoprazan Launch in Japan 
 Vonoprazan Regulatory Status 
 Vonoprazan first received approval in Japan on December 26, 2014 as TAKECAB® for the following indications: 
  
• | Healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Adjunct to antibiotics in H. pylori treatment;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Gastric ulcer;
--+---------------


• | Duodenal ulcer;
--+----------------


• | Prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer during low-dose aspirin administration; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Vonoprazan was subsequently approved in Japan in February 2016 for the treatment of H. pylori in combination packs with antibiotics (Vonosap Pack 400, Vonosap Pack 800, and Vonopion Pack), as VOCINTI in the Philippines (October 2017), Singapore (March 2018), Thailand (July 2018), Argentina (September 2018), Peru (September 2018), South Korea (March 2019), Taiwan (March 2019), Malaysia (May 2019), Ecuador (December 2019), China (December 2019), Indonesia (February 2020), as INZELM in Brazil (March 2020), and DENZIZA in Mexico (December 2020). Vonoprazan is currently under review for approval by regulatory authorities in additional countries in Latin America and Asia. 
 Vonoprazan Commercialization in Japan 
 Vonoprazan was approved in Japan in December 2014. In its fifth full year on the market, vonoprazan generated approximately $650 million in net sales in Japan, a 24% increase over the prior year. In addition, in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, vonoprazan generated over $214 million in net sales, a 16% increase over the corresponding quarter from the prior fiscal year.

Vonoprazan Net Sales Since Approval
 

We believe that the market dynamic for anti-secretory agents in Japan is similar to that in the United States. In both countries, the anti-secretory market is largely genericized. Ahead of the vonoprazan launch in Japan, all PPIs, other than Nexium, were available as generics. As of 2017, generic drugs in Japan represent approximately 70% of the market by volume, compared to the United States where generics are approximately 90% of the market by volume. Additionally, the Japanese government set a goal to increase generic use to 80% by 2020. Although vonoprazan and Dexilant are priced at a premium to generic PPIs in Japan and the United States, respectively, both have experienced commercial success. 
Vonoprazan Commercial Opportunity and Strategy 
 The market for prevention and treatment of acid-related GI diseases in the United States and Europe is large. There were approximately 6.8 billion PPI doses prescribed for the 12 months ended October 31, 2020. We estimate that there are approximately 65 million individuals with GERD in the United States and 50 million individuals with GERD in the EU5, of whom 15% to 45% are inadequately treated with PPIs. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 115 million individuals in the United States infected with H. pylori, of which 2.5 million are treated each year, and 145 million individuals in the EU5 infected with H. pylori. 
 Over many decades of use, multiple drug classes and individual drugs have demonstrated the substantial commercial opportunity for therapies treating acid-related GI diseases. H2RAs including Axid, Pepcid, Tagamet, and Zantac provided the first significant improvement in disease management over antacids and as a class reached $3.5 billion in annual sales. After H2RAs, PPIs emerged as the new standard of care. Prior to the introduction of generic and OTC alternatives, annual PPI class sales reached approximately $12.5 billion in the United States, and peak sales for individual brands were approximately $3.7 billion for Prilosec, approximately $3.5 billion for Nexium, and $3.4 billion for Prevacid. 
 As recently as 2015, the last branded PPI, Dexilant, reached approximately $530 million in sales in the United States despite limited differentiation from other PPIs. As of June 30, 2019, Dexilant was priced at a significant premium to generic PPIs on the market. Even with premium pricing, Dexilant obtained broad insurance coverage and favorable access. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 90% of commercially covered lives and 80% of Medicare covered lives had access to Dexilant. Furthermore, of those commercially covered lives, 65% had unrestricted access to the drug without prior authorization or step edits and 35% of patients had access at the lowest branded cost tier. We believe that, if approved in our markets, vonoprazan will be the first of the next generation of anti-secretory therapies to improve the standard of care for acid-related GI diseases by providing a safe and effective treatment option for the millions of patients in need of more potent, rapid, or durable acid suppression. Additionally, we believe the potential differentiation of vonoprazan compared to PPIs could result in attractive market access and formulary positioning.

In July 2020, we conducted a U.S. market research study which surveyed 150 gastroenterologists and 152 primary care physicians who treat GERD and H. Pylori. For the treatment of GERD, 55% to 60% of physicians believed that vonoprazan has demonstrated superior efficacy in the healing and maintenance of healed esophageal erosions compared to existing EE treatments, provides faster onset of action compared to existing GERD treatments, and has superior duration and magnitude of gastric pH control compared to existing GERD treatments. For the treatment of H. pylori infection, surveyed physicians highlighted the need for improved eradication rates and more convenient dosing as key unmet needs. Over 50% of surveyed physicians agreed that vonoprazan dual or triple therapy provided a superior eradication rate in patients with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, and, on average, 48% and 47% reported a preference to use vonoprazan first line in patients with H. pylori infection, and patients with refractory H. pylori infection, respectively. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We are in the process of building marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. We plan to independently commercialize vonoprazan in the United States by building a leading specialty gastroenterology-focused commercial infrastructure to support the adoption of vonoprazan. We believe we can successfully launch vonoprazan in the United States with a focused sales force targeting high prescribers of PPIs, particularly gastroenterologists and primary care physicians. PPI prescribing is highly concentrated with approximately 70% of prescriptions in both H. pylori and erosive esophagitis being written by 20% of the PPI prescribers (approximately 40,000 prescribers), according to IQVIA data. We believe we have an opportunity to achieve significant share of voice and exposure to physicians given the scarcity of actively marketed anti-secretory medicines. 
 To address the commercial opportunity for vonoprazan in Europe and Canada, we plan to seek one or more partners with existing commercial infrastructure and expertise in these markets.
 Additional Vonoprazan Development Opportunities 
 Indications 
 While we are initially focused on the development of vonoprazan for the treatment of erosive esophagitis and the treatment of H. pylori infection, and plan on initiating our NERD development program in the second quarter of 2021, we believe there are opportunities to expand the use of vonoprazan to other indications in our licensed territories. For example, in Japan, vonoprazan is also approved for the treatment of gastric ulcers, treatment of duodenal ulcers, prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer during low-dose aspirin administration, and prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer during NSAID administration. 
 In addition to NERD and indications for which vonoprazan is approved in Japan, we believe there are additional opportunities to develop vonoprazan for the treatment of GI diseases. 
 Barrett’s esophagus and Zollinger Ellison syndrome are severe diseases related to acid secretion where PPIs are the current standard of care. The improved acid control of vonoprazan relative to PPIs may lead to improved results over PPIs. 
 Eosinophilic esophagitis is an autoimmune disease with significant unmet need. Although not approved for this indication, PPIs are prescribed for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Vonoprazan demonstrated similar efficacy to PPIs in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial in Japan. In this clinical trial, 112 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis were treated with vonoprazan, or the PPI rabeprazole or esomeprazole. Of patients treated with vonoprazan, 82% had complete relief of symptoms compared to 70% for esomeprazole and 76-78% for rabeprazole. Similarly, 35% of patients treated with vonoprazan demonstrated complete remission of eosinophilic esophagitis by histology, compared to 37% for esomeprazole and 31-38% for rabeprazole. 
 Formulations and Packaging 
 Orally Disintegrating Tablet.    An orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, formulation for vonoprazan is currently in development by Takeda. We may conduct one or more Phase 1 trials to support potential approval of the ODT formulation. We believe that the ODT represents a meaningful commercial opportunity for patients with difficulty swallowing, as estimated peak U.S. sales of the lansoprazole ODT formulation were over $450 million. 

30
--

 
Intravenous Formulation.    We are exploring the potential to develop an intravenous formulation of vonoprazan for use in acute bleeding, critically ill patients, or other in-hospital applications. Several PPIs have approved intravenous formulations. 
 Pediatric Formulation.    We are exploring the potential to develop an oral formulation, in addition to an ODT formulation, for pediatric use. 
 Over the Counter Use 
 We believe that vonoprazan has the ideal profile for an OTC product, including the potential for on-demand symptom relief and a well-tolerated safety profile. Sales of OTC heartburn relief products in the United States are substantial, constituting a multi-billion-dollar market. 
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies and public and private research institutions. If vonoprazan receives marketing approval in the United States, Europe or Canada, it will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Some of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with vonoprazan. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject recruitment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for vonoprazan, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that vonoprazan, if approved, will be priced at a premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 We expect that vonoprazan, if approved for the treatment of erosive esophagitis and treatment of H. pylori infection, will primarily compete with generic PPIs marketed by multiple pharmaceutical companies in both the prescription and OTC markets. Additionally, in March 2020, RedHill Biopharma Ltd. launched Talicia, a co-formulated capsule comprising generic omeprazole, amoxicillin, and rifabutin for the treatment of H. pylori infection. 
 We are also aware of other P-CABs in territories outside of the United States that, if developed and approved in our territories, may compete with vonoprazan. Revaprazan is marketed by Yuhan Corporation in South Korea. Tegoprazan is marketed by CJ Healthcare Corp. in South Korea and is currently in development in Japan by RaQualia Pharma, Inc. Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., has filed an application for regulatory approval of fexuprazan in South Korea and plans to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial in China in the first half of 2021, Jeil Pharm has opened a Phase 2 trial in South Korea of its P-CAB candidate, JP-1366, in erosive esophagitis, and Cinclus Pharma AG’s X842 has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Europe and is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. To our knowledge, none of these compounds have demonstrated superiority to PPIs on clinical endpoints. 
 Additionally, we are aware of several clinical-stage PPIs in territories outside of the United States that if developed and approved in our licensed territories may compete with vonoprazan. These include Dexa Medica’s

DLBS-2411, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in Indonesia, Sihuan Pharmaceutical’s anaprazole, currently in Phase 3 clinical trials in China, Eisai’s azeloprazole, currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in Japan, and Sidem Pharma’s tenatoprazole, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials in Europe and Canada. 
 Intellectual Property  
 Intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, is important to our business. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary intellectual property protection for vonoprazan, as well as for future product candidates and novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing or filing U.S. and foreign patents and applications relating to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. 
 Our patent portfolio, comprising patents and patent applications exclusively licensed to us, is built with a goal of establishing broad protection that generally includes, for the product candidate compound, claims directed to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions or formulations, methods of synthesis, and methods of treatment using such pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio covering vonoprazan consists solely of exclusively licensed patents and patent applications from Takeda. Subject to the terms of the license agreement we entered into with Takeda on May 7, 2019, or the Takeda License, we have licensed from Takeda exclusive rights in the United States, Europe, and Canada to patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter, formulation, use and/or manufacture of vonoprazan. Our patent portfolio comprises 11 distinct patent families protecting the technology relating to the compound vonoprazan and its synthetic intermediates, methods of synthesizing vonoprazan and related compounds, various formulations of vonoprazan products, as well as methods of treating diseases with vonoprazan and related compounds. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consists of approximately 21 issued U.S. patents, 5 pending U.S. applications, 11 issued European patents subsequently validated in individual European countries, 5 pending European applications, 4 issued Canadian patents, and 5 pending Canadian applications. The issued patents and pending applications have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2038, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions. The issued U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of vonoprazan is expected to expire in August 2028, not including patent term extension. The issued U.S. patent covering the formulation of vonoprazan is expected to expire in August 2030, not including patent term extension. 
 The term of individual patents in our portfolio depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be eligible for patent term adjustment, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for delays incurred at the USPTO during the patent prosecution process. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent per approved drug may be extended under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek any available patent term extension to any issued patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our

technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us or Takeda in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, issued patents do not guarantee the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Issued patents only allow us to block potential competitors from practicing the claimed inventions of the issued patents. 
 Further, patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing vonoprazan and any future product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for vonoprazan and any future product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to vonoprazan and any future product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
 It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us, and for employees and consultants to enter into invention assignment agreements with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the individual contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to Phathom, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
 Further, we have filed for and have received trademark registrations for our company name “Phathom Pharmaceuticals” in the United States, European Union, and other foreign jurisdictions, and are pursuing trademark protection in certain other foreign jurisdictions. 
 License Agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited 
 On May 7, 2019, we and Takeda entered into the Takeda License, pursuant to which, Takeda granted us an exclusive, sublicensable (with Takeda’s reasonable consent) license under certain patents and know how relating to vonoprazan and owned or controlled by Takeda during the term of the Takeda License to commercialize vonoprazan products using specified formulations for all human therapeutic uses in the United States, Europe and Canada, and a non-exclusive license under such patents and know how to develop and manufacture such vonoprazan products anywhere in the world (subject to Takeda’s consent as to each country) for the purposes of commercializing the vonoprazan products in the United States, Europe and Canada. We granted Takeda a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license under our rights in any patents and know-how that are necessary or useful to enable Takeda to develop and manufacture vonoprazan products anywhere in the world for the purposes of commercialization outside United States, Europe and Canada. We also granted Takeda an exclusive, royalty-free license under our rights in certain patents and know-how owned or controlled by us and necessary for the exploitation of vonoprazan products, in each case for Takeda to commercialize any vonoprazan product outside of the United States, Canada, and Europe and for purposes other than human therapeutic use. 
 During the term of the Takeda License, we and our affiliates are not permitted to commercialize any pharmaceutical product, other than vonoprazan, that treats acid-related disorders, except for certain generic and OTC competing products in specified circumstances. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the vonoprazan products. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the vonoprazan products in our licensed territory.

Under the Takeda License, Takeda has the sole right and authority, with our input, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain all Takeda and joint patents on a worldwide basis at its own cost. We are responsible, at our cost, for preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents on inventions made solely by us in connection with vonoprazan, subject to input from Takeda. We have the first right to enforce the licensed patent rights with respect to certain infringing products in the United States, Europe and Canada. 
 We paid Takeda upfront consideration consisting of a cash payment of $25.0 million, 1,084,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 7,588,000 shares of common stock, or the Takeda Warrant. We agreed to make milestone payments to Takeda upon achieving certain tiered aggregate annual net sales of licensed products in the United States, Europe and Canada up a total maximum milestone amount of $250.0 million. We also agreed to make tiered royalty payments in the low double digits to the mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis from the first commercial sale of such product in such country, until the latest of expiration of the licensed patents covering the applicable product, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 15 years following first commercial sale in such country. 
 The Takeda License will continue until the expiration of the obligation to pay royalties in all countries and on all products. We may terminate the Takeda License in its entirety without cause upon six months’ prior written notice. We and Takeda may terminate the Takeda License in the case of the other party’s insolvency, or upon prior written notice within a specified time period for the other party’s material uncured breach. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License in its entirety if we challenge the licensed patents, or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of vonoprazan. Vonoprazan is a small molecule that can be manufactured using commercially available technologies. We currently rely on Takeda to supply us with vonoprazan drug product for clinical use.
With respect to any future product candidates, we expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture clinical supplies and commercial quantities of any approved product. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing experience to oversee our relationships with Takeda and Sandoz. 
 Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement
 In April 
2020, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Takeda , or 
the Takeda Supply Agreement, 
pursuant to which Takeda will supply us with commercial quantities of vonoprazan bulk drug. Pursuant to the Commercial Supply Agreement, Takeda has agreed to supply us certain quantities of vonoprazan bulk drug product according to approved specifications at a fixed price per batch of bulk drug product in order to commercialize vonoprazan in accordance with the Takeda 
License. The Takeda Supply Agreement sets forth a minimum and maximum number of batches of vonoprazan bulk drug product that we are required to order each year, and if we do not purchase the minimum number of batches in a year, other than as a result of Takeda’s inability to supply such batches for any reason, or as a result of force majeure, we are required to pay Takeda the amount corresponding to the shortfall. Takeda has no obligation to supply bulk drug product above the maximum number of batches specified in the Takeda Supply Agreement. 
 In addition, under the Takeda Supply Agreement, Takeda will 
provide certain services and 
materials, including vonoprazan drug substance
, to support the transfer of technology and Takeda manufacturing know-how to our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, that we designate. Takeda 
has agreed to negotiate in good faith to provide 
reasonable additional support, including technical advice and supply of materials, to assist us with technology transfers to the CMOs. 
 The 
Takeda Supply Agreement will continue until the earlier of (a) 
two years from the date we place an order for bulk drug product for the first commercial launch of vonoprazan in any jurisdiction in the United States, Europe or Canada, and (b) 
December 31, 2023. The Takeda Supply Agreement may be terminated upon written notice by either party if the other party has failed to remedy a material breach within a specified cure 
period following written notice of such breach. The Takeda Supply Agreement will terminate immediately upon the termination of the

Takeda License in accordance with its terms. We are exploring additional options for commercial supply of vonoprazan bulk tablets and API from other third-party contract manufacturers.
 Sandoz Supply and Packaging Agreement
 In December 2020, we entered into a Supply and Packaging Services Agreement (with Sandoz GmbH, or 
the Sandoz Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Sandoz has agreed to supply commercial quantities of amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets, to package these antibiotics with vonoprazan drug product in finished convenience packs, and to supply us with these convenience packs. 
 Pursuant to the Sandoz Supply Agreement, we agreed to purchase certain quantities of convenience packs from Sandoz at an agreed upon price per pack. The price per pack is fixed for the first two (2) years following launch of the convenience pack in the United State and may be adjusted thereafter based on Sandoz’s cost 
increases, subject to an annual cap. The Sandoz Supply Agreement sets forth an annual minimum number of convenience packs that we must purchase each year 
following launch of the convenience pack product
, and if we do not meet 
the minimum order 
in a given 
year, we are required to pay Sandoz the amount corresponding to the shortfall. Sandoz has no obligation to supply convenience packs above a maximum number of packs above a certain percentage of our forecasts. We have agreed to purchase convenience packs, amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets, in each case intended for sale in the United States, exclusively from Sandoz during the five-year period following launch.
 The 
Sandoz Supply Agreement will continue 
for five years from launch of the convenience pack in the U.S. and may be terminated effective at the end of the initial five-year term upon written notice by either party prior to the end of the third year following launch. In the absence of such notice, the Sandoz Supply Agreement will extend automatically for an additional three-year period, and thereafter as mutually agreed upon by the parties. The Sandoz Supply Agreement may also be terminated at any time upon written notice by either party for uncured material breach following written notice of such breach. 
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMP, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 NDA Review and Approval Process 
 The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after 
 
 
37
--

 
the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a Fast Track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis 

38
--

 
before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 The FDA can also designate a drug as a “breakthrough therapy.” A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Vonoprazan has received Fast Track designation for the treatment of H. pylori infection in combination with both amoxicillin and clarithromycin and with amoxicillin alone and is potentially eligible for priority review, which we plan to explore. We may also explore some of these expedited development and review programs for future product candidates, as appropriate.

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 
 
40
--

 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. 
 Additionally, under the GAIN Act, the FDA may designate a product as a “qualified infectious disease product,” or QIDP. In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms established and maintained by the FDA under the law. The FDA interprets QIDP designation to apply to a specific drug product, including a specific dosage form of the product. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application, and the FDA will respond to a request for QIDP designation within 60 days of the date the FDA receives the request. The GAIN Act permits the FDA to revoke a QIDP designation only if the request for such designation contained an untrue statement of material fact. 
 The benefits of QIDP designation include potential eligibility for priority review and Fast Track designation, and an extension by an additional five years of any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension that may be awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment. The GAIN Act provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of QIDP based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved. 
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and 
transparency laws regarding drug pricing and payments or other items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, 
decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for vonoprazan and any future product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider vonoprazan and any future product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.

U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act, are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also 
unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, will impact the Affordable Care Act.   
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.  
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.  
 The likelihood of implementation of these and 
other reform initiatives proposed by the former Trump administration 
is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. Moreover, in the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical

product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
  
• | the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Data and marketing exclusivity 
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year

market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Pediatric investigation plan 
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial. 
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect in 2020, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply. 
 Data privacy and security laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, in the U.S., HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of

the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
