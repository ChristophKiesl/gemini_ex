ITEM 1. Business
The Company
Crocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “Crocs,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for women, men, and children. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. The vast majority of shoes within our collection contain Croslite™ material, a proprietary, molded footwear technology, delivering extraordinary comfort with each step.
Products
Since we first introduced a single-style clog in six colors in 2002, we have grown to be a world leader of innovative, casual footwear for women, men, and children. Recognized globally for our unmistakable iconic clog silhouette, we have taken the successful formula of a simple design aesthetic, paired it with modern comfort, and expanded into a wide variety of casual footwear products including sandals—wedges, flips, and slides—that meet the needs of the whole family. Our mission of “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” continued in 2020 with the fourth year of our global “Come As You Are™” campaign.
We offer a broad portfolio of all-season products, while remaining true to our core molded footwear heritage. The vast majority of Crocs™ shoes feature Croslite™ material, a proprietary, revolutionary technology that gives each pair of shoes the soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant qualities that our fans know and love.
At the heart of our brand’s DNA are our clogs, sandals, and Jibbitz™ charms. The Classic Clog, our most iconic style for adults and children, embodies our innovation in molding, simplicity of design, and all-day comfort. The unique feel of the Classic Clog can be experienced throughout the vast majority of our product line due to the use and design of Croslite™. Sandals are a natural extension of our brand, leveraging our signature molding technology to provide casual, comfortable footwear for a variety of wearing occasions. Jibbitz™ charms enhance the consumer experience by providing an outlet for customization and heightening our message of “Come As You Are™.”
We also use Croslite™ material formulations in connection with new material technologies used in our LiteRide™ collection, as we focus on visible comfort technology. LiteRide™ features comfort-focused, proprietary foam insoles which are soft, lightweight, and resilient.
We strive to provide our global consumers with comfortable, casual, colorful, and innovative footwear styles, with a focus on molded product. Our collections address many wearing occasions and meet the needs of the entire family. We enjoy licensing partnerships with Disney, including Marvel and Lucasfilm, Universal Studios, Nintendo, and Warner Bros., among others, which allow us to bring popular global franchises and characters to life on our product in a fun, exciting way.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
As one of the world’s largest footwear companies, we strive to make a positive impact on the global footwear industry and our planet by committing to transparent, socially conscious, and sustainable business practices.
Through our ESG Program, we expect to continue to advance our sustainable business practices with the goal of consistently delivering products that exceed customer and consumer expectations. We believe the progress of our ESG efforts is best served by disclosing goals and relevant metrics, and, to this end, we are aligning our program with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) framework for reporting and disclosure in order to establish specific goals, targets, and policies to enhance our ESG progress.
Environmental
We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment by focusing on sustainability initiatives in our operations and throughout our supply chain and product lifecycle.
In 2020, we identified four key areas of focus: (i) incorporating more sustainable product ingredients; (ii) disclosing efforts and progress towards reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, energy, water consumption, and waste; (iii) transitioning to more environmentally friendly packaging; and (iv) exploring sustainable solutions for product end of life.
We have also joined the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (“SAC”) for the purpose of baselining and establishing goals across emissions, energy and water use, and waste reduction/disposal for both our internal brand activities as well as our factory partners. Crocs is also working to align with Science-Based Targets for the purpose of developing meaningful GHG emissions reduction goals that support the prevention of climate change.
Social
Human Capital
At Crocs, our vision to make “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” starts with our people. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,600 employees in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. This includes approximately 2,600 employees in our retail stores, 1,000 employees at our corporate/regional offices, and 1,000 employees at our distribution centers.
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and customers. In response to COVID-19, our corporate offices, retail stores, and distribution centers have implemented various elevated safety protocols, in accordance with local guidelines and regulations, including temperature checks, mandatory mask policies, social distancing, access to hand sanitizer, plexiglass partitions, and enhanced cleaning of the facilities. To support our workforce, we also implemented a supplemental sick policy for our U.S. workforce with additional hours available for paid time off related to COVID-19.
To ensure that we remain an employer of choice for what we believe is the most talented workforce in the footwear industry, we have implemented initiatives across our business and geographies to develop leadership capabilities, enable meaningful professional experiences, offer a compelling employee value proposition, and create a transparent, collaborative culture that “celebrates one-of-a-kinds and stands together with all different kinds.” We are also committed to an equitable total rewards philosophy as well as pay transparency in all regions.
We are proud of our culture of inclusion, which encompasses regular employee listening, employee-led inclusivity councils, and diversity at all levels. Crocs strives to create a culture of inclusion where employees can freely contribute equally regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation. Our Code of Ethics codifies these values.
Investing in talent is a key component of our human capital strategy. Crocs is committed to identifying and developing the next generation of leadership. We conduct an annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Board of Directors (“Board”) with a focus on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles.
We continue to emphasize employee development and training. We have established a culture of learning and development, with robust training at all levels on a wide range of topics from Leading for Respect and Inclusion, Thriving through Adversity (for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic), Leading for Innovation, and Facilitating Team Communication.
Crocs is committed to providing an employee value proposition that is compelling, market-competitive, and performance-based. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment. We aim to generally position total direct compensation within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.
Our regular employee engagement surveys reflect a highly engaged global workforce, with, among others, high scores returned by employees recommending “Crocs as a great place to work” and saying “it is easy for people with diverse backgrounds to be accepted.”
Social Capital
At Crocs, we strive to ensure our products are sourced, produced, and delivered to our customers in a manner that upholds international labor and human rights standards. To this end, we have implemented measures to ensure our supply chain complies with these standards, including utilizing internal and external parties to conduct both scheduled and unannounced social compliance reviews. We also maintain a factory Social Compliance Code of Conduct and a certification process – our contracted factories and direct suppliers sign an annual Statement of Compliance, verifying that their operations are in 
compliance with all local laws and customs regarding hiring practices, wages, and working conditions, as well as our Code of Conduct.
We also monitor chemicals and substances in our supply chain for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements consistent with our Restricted Substances Policy and expect our contracted factories and suppliers to take a proactive stance in eliminating any hazardous chemicals or substances in the manufacture of Crocs products.
Community
Giving back to the community is extremely important to us. Through our global “Crocs Cares” program, we focus on providing shoes to address human needs, funds to support those in need, and time to enable our employees to support their local communities. To this end, we have donated over one million pairs of shoes in the past five years, and in 2020 donated over 860,000 pairs of shoes to frontline healthcare workers and other organizations as part of our “A Free Pair for Healthcare” program.
Governance
At Crocs, we have strong corporate governance mechanisms in place, along with robust internal controls over our financial reporting framework. We also have Enterprise Risk Management and Ethics & Compliance program frameworks, with regular updates provided to our Board committees as well as our Board. For our ESG efforts, Crocs has established an ESG/sustainability management and oversight framework under the direction of our Executive Vice President, Chief Legal & Risk Officer. The Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board oversees our ESG efforts.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected in our Board, comprised of 38% female members as of December 31, 2020. We are continuing efforts to expand our Board’s diversity.
Sales and Marketing
We run our business across three geographic regions: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), which are discussed in more detail in “Business Segments and Geographic Information” below. We prioritize five core markets including: (i) the U.S., (ii) Japan, (iii) China, (iv) South Korea, and (v) Germany. These countries represent key geographies where we believe the greatest opportunities for growth exist. We also concentrate our marketing efforts on these countries, to increase customer awareness of both our brand and our full product range. 
Each season, we focus on presenting a compelling brand story and experience for our new product introductions as well as our on-going core products. We employ social and digital marketing centered on showcasing our clog and sandal silhouettes and our Jibbitz™ charms. We are growing our clog silhouette with new colors, graphics, licensed images, embellishments, and accessories, such as Jibbitz™ charms, that allow for personalization. We are expanding our sandal offerings as we pursue a greater share of a large market that currently has no clear global leader. We are continuing to invest in designer, celebrity, and brand collaborations, as well as celebrity brand ambassadors to raise consumer engagement with our brand. See Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on total marketing costs for the year.
Distribution Channels
The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products in more than 80 countries through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international multi-brand retailers, mono-branded partner stores, e-tailers, and distributors; our retail channel consists of company-operated stores; and our e-commerce channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites and third-party marketplaces.
Wholesale Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 50.0%, 53.3%, and 53.1% of revenues, respectively, were derived through our wholesale channel. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international, multi-brand, brick-and-mortar retailers, e-tailers, and distributors in certain countries, including partner store operators. Brick-and-mortar customers typically include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our wholesale brick-and-mortar retailers were closed for a portion of the year.
Outside the U.S., we use distributors when we believe such arrangements are economically preferable to direct sales. Distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell those products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements or other terms are not met. In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our distributors’ stores were closed for a portion of the year and in many cases experienced lower traffic due to the decline in tourism.
No single wholesale customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Retail Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 24.1%, 28.2%, and 30.1%, respectively, of our revenues were derived through our retail channel. During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global retail stores were closed for a portion of the year. However, the vast majority of our stores were open as of December 31, 2020. We operate our retail channel through three platforms: company-operated full-price retail stores, outlet stores, and store-in-store locations. With the continued worldwide consumer shift toward e-commerce, we are carefully managing our retail fleet, especially full-priced retail stores. As of December 31, 2020, we had 351 company-operated stores. See Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on store locations by platform.
Full-Price Retail Stores
Our company-operated full-price retail stores allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our product range to consumers and provide us with the opportunity to interact with those consumers directly. We believe the optimal location for our full-price retail stores is in high foot-traffic shopping malls or districts.
Outlet Stores
Our company-operated outlet stores allow us to sell discontinued and overstocked merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full-priced products in certain of our outlet stores as well as built-for-outlet products. Outlet stores are generally located within outlet shopping centers.
Store-in-Store Locations
Our company-operated store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines, with flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot-traffic areas. With efficient use of retail space, and limited fixed cost and capital investment, we believe store-in-store locations can be effective vehicles for selling our products in certain geographic areas.
Company-Operated Retail Stores
The following table illustrates the net change during 2020 in the number of our company-operated retail stores by reportable operating segment and country:

 | December 31, 2019 | Opened | | Closed | December 31, 2020
Americas | | | | | 
United States | 153 | | 2 | | 1 | 154

Total | 367 | | 11 | | 27 | 351

E-commerce Channel
As of December 31, 2020, we offered our products through 13 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide and also on third-party marketplaces. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 25.9%, 18.5%, and 16.8%, respectively, of our revenues were derived through this channel. Our e-commerce presence facilitates increased access to our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. We continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated digital marketing activities to enhance the consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping.
Business Segments and Geographic Information
We have three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: the Americas, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. See Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information related to our operating segments.
Raw Materials
Croslite™, our proprietary closed-cell resin brand, incorporates the primary material formulations used in the vast majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. Our Croslite™ materials are formulated to create soft, comfortable, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant footwear. We continue to invest in research and development to refine our materials to enhance these properties and develop new properties for specific applications.
Croslite™ is produced by compounding elastomer resins purchased from major chemical manufacturers, together with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. Multiple suppliers produce the elastomer resins used in the Croslite™ material. In 
the future, we may identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, those elastomer resins. All of the other raw materials that we use to produce the Croslite™ formulations are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers.
Some of the products we offer are constructed using leather, textile fabrics, or other material formulations, such as those we brand LiteRide™. These materials are obtained from a number of third-party sources and we believe these materials are also broadly available.
Sourcing
Our strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally-diversified, cost-efficient third-party manufacturing base. We source our inventory production from multiple third-party manufacturers, primarily in Vietnam and China. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our largest third-party manufacturer, operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 46%, 38%, and 45%, respectively, and our second largest third-party manufacturer, also operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 22%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, of our footwear unit volume. We believe that the manufacturing capabilities required to produce our footwear are broadly available. See the risk factor under “Risks Related to International Operations — We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside of the U.S.” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on risks associated with sourcing.
Distribution and Logistics
We strive to enhance our distribution and logistics network to further streamline our supply chain, increase our speed to market, and lower operating costs. As of December 31, 2020, we principally stored our finished goods inventory in company-operated warehouses and distribution and logistics facilities located in the U.S. and the Netherlands, as well as in a leased third-party operated distribution center in Japan. During 2020, we increased throughput as a result of the prior year move of our U.S. distribution center from Ontario, California to Dayton, Ohio, and we expanded the Ohio campus to further increase our distribution capacity in the Americas. In 2020, construction began on a new EMEA distribution center in the Netherlands, which is expected to be fully operational in 2021, and we completed the relocation of our third-party operated Asia Pacific distribution center within Japan. We also utilized third-party operated distribution centers located in China, Australia, Korea, Singapore, India, Russia, and Brazil. As of December 31, 2020, our company-operated and leased warehouse and distribution facilities provided us with 1.8 million square feet, and our third-party operated distribution facilities provided us with 0.5 million square feet, with additional area available based on inventory levels. We also ship directly to certain of our wholesale customers from our third-party manufacturers, and certain distributors pick up orders directly from our third-party manufacturers.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, trade dress, and patent protections to establish, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights in our product designs, brands, materials, and research and development efforts, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada, among other countries. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for other marks and logos in various countries around the world.
In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of filing the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. We believe our trademarks and patents are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and patents covering certain product designs and branding that we utilize today. We aggressively police our patents, trademarks, and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, as we deem necessary.
We consider the formulations of the materials used to produce our footwear covered by our trademark Croslite™ and LiteRide™, among others, valuable trade secrets. The material formulations are manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formulations by using an exclusive supply agreement for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality 
agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third party using our formulations in the production of footwear. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of the Croslite™ and LiteRide™ materials, which constitutes a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect these trade secrets.
We also actively combat counterfeiting and other infringements of our brand by monitoring the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators, attorneys, and customs agents, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks, and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Competition
The global casual, athletic, and fashion footwear markets are highly competitive. Although we do not believe that we compete directly with any single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our products, we believe portions of our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce businesses compete with companies including, but not limited to: NIKE, Inc., adidas AG, Under Armour, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Skechers USA, Inc., Steven Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc., and VF Corporation. Our company-operated retail locations and e-commerce sites also compete with some of our wholesale partners.
The principal elements of competition in these markets include brand awareness, product functionality, design, comfort, quality, price, customer service, and marketing and distribution. We believe that our unique footwear designs, our material formulations, our prices, our product line, and our distribution network position us well in the marketplace. However, a number of companies in the casual footwear industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have. See the risk factor under “Risks Related to our Products — We face significant competition” included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
