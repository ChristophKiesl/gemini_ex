 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc. (“Griffin”) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, acquiring, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties. Griffin seeks to add to its industrial/warehouse property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings in select markets targeted by Griffin. Griffin also owns several office/flex properties and undeveloped land. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain of its real estate assets that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin’s core focus on industrial/warehouse properties.
 Griffin’s industrial/warehouse buildings are located in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, and the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area, and in fiscal 2019, Griffin expanded into central Florida by acquiring 7466 Chancellor Drive (“7466 Chancellor”), an approximately 100,000 square foot fully leased industrial/warehouse building in Orlando, Florida. Griffin expects to continue to seek to acquire and develop properties that are consistent with its core industrial/warehouse focused strategy. Griffin targets properties that are in close proximity to transportation infrastructure (highways, airports, railways and seaports) and can accommodate single and multiple tenants in flexible layouts. Griffin expects that most of such potential acquisitions of either undeveloped land or land and buildings will likely be located outside of the Hartford area in select markets targeted by Griffin. 
 As of November 30, 2019, Griffin owned forty buildings comprising approximately 4,462,000 square feet that were 90% leased. Approximately 90% of Griffin’s square footage is industrial/warehouse space, with the balance being office/flex space. As of November 30, 2019, approximately 93% of Griffin’s industrial/warehouse space was leased and approximately 70% of Griffin’s office/flex space was leased. As stated in “Item 2. Properties” below, Griffin generally uses nonrecourse mortgage loans and occasionally uses construction loans to finance some of its real estate development activities, and as of November 30, 2019, approximately $144.5 million was outstanding under all such loans. In fiscal 2019, operating income from leasing (“Leasing NOI”)1, which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties, was approximately $24.2 million, while debt service (interest and scheduled principal payments) on nonrecourse mortgage loans and a construction loan was approximately $10.3 million.
 In fiscal 2019, the net effect of leasing transactions was an increase of approximately 269,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2019, as compared to November 30, 2018, and a decrease of approximately 10,000 square feet of office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2019, as compared to November 30, 2018. In fiscal 2019, in addition to the acquisition of 7466 Chancellor, Griffin completed and placed in service two industrial/warehouse buildings (“160 International” and “180 International”) aggregating approximately 283,000 square feet on a land parcel in Concord, North Carolina (the “Concord Land”) in the greater Charlotte area, that was purchased in fiscal 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Griffin entered into two leases aggregating approximately 105,000 square feet in 160 International. In fiscal 2019, Griffin also leased approximately 64,000 square feet of previously vacant space in 6975 Ambassador Drive (“6975 Ambassador”), an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania that was built on speculation in fiscal 2018. Additionally, in Connecticut, Griffin leased approximately 30,000 square feet (mostly industrial/warehouse space) of previously vacant space in connection with the expansion and extension of two leases. A lease of approximately 23,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in New England Tradeport (“NE Tradeport”), Griffin’s industrial park in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut, expired in fiscal 2019 and was not renewed. A reduction of approximately 17,000 square feet of office/flex space leased resulted from several lease extensions and relocations whereby the tenants reduced their space leased. Such relocations included a tenant in Griffin’s two multi-story office buildings in Griffin Center in Windsor, Connecticut that downsized from approximately 34,000 square feet under leases that were set to expire on July 31, 2019, to approximately 25,000 square feet under a new six-year lease. In fiscal 2019, Griffin extended leases aggregating approximately 141,000 square feet, that included two leases for industrial/warehouse 
 1 Leasing NOI is not a financial measure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). It is presented because Griffin believes it is a useful financial indicator for measuring results of its real estate leasing activities. However, it should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as a measure of operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In prior years, Griffin referred to this metric as “profit from leasing activities.” In fiscal 2019, Griffin changed from profit from leasing activities to Leasing NOI to be more in line with terminology used by other real estate companies.

 space in NE Tradeport aggregating approximately 80,000 square feet and several leases for office/flex space aggregating approximately 61,000 square feet.
     The net effect of Griffin’s leasing transactions in fiscal 2018 was an increase of approximately 256,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2018, as compared to November 30, 2017, and an increase of approximately 4,000 square feet of office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2018, as compared to November 30, 2017. In fiscal 2018, Griffin completed and placed in service two industrial/warehouse buildings, one of which was an approximately 234,000 square foot build-to-suit building (“220 Tradeport”) in NE Tradeport. As a build-to-suit building, Griffin entered into a twelve and a half-year lease for 220 Tradeport prior to the start of construction. The other building completed in fiscal 2018 was 6975 Ambassador. In fiscal 2018, Griffin also leased approximately 70,000 square feet of previously vacant NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space, including the remaining 63,000 square feet in 330 Stone Road (“330 Stone”), an approximately 137,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in NE Tradeport that was placed in service and partially leased just prior to the end of fiscal 2017. Griffin also extended leases aggregating approximately 408,000 square feet in fiscal 2018, including a full building lease of 4275 Fritch Drive, an approximately 228,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley. Also in fiscal 2018, Griffin completed a lease of approximately 11,000 square feet of previously vacant office/flex space. Leases for approximately 55,000 square feet (mostly industrial/warehouse space) expired in fiscal 2018 and were not re-leased. 
 The net effect of Griffin’s construction, acquisition and leasing transactions in fiscal 2017 was an increase of approximately 461,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space under lease as of November 30, 2017, as compared to November 30, 2016, and a decrease of approximately 11,000 square feet of office/flex space under lease as of November 30, 2017, as compared to November 30, 2016. In fiscal 2017, Griffin entered the Charlotte, North Carolina market with the purchase of 215 International Drive (“215 International”), an approximately 277,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Concord, North Carolina. Subsequent to completing the purchase, Griffin leased the approximately 73,000 square feet in that building that was vacant at the time of the acquisition. Also in fiscal 2017, Griffin completed construction, on speculation, of 330 Stone and leased approximately 74,000 square feet of that building to a tenant that relocated from approximately 39,000 square feet in another of Griffin’s NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings. The balance of 330 Stone was leased in fiscal 2018. Griffin was able to backfill the approximately 39,000 square feet that was vacated with a new tenant that took occupancy in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2017, Griffin also leased approximately 104,000 square feet of previously vacant NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse space, including a ten and a half-year lease for approximately 89,000 square feet. Griffin extended leases aggregating approximately 387,000 square feet in fiscal 2017, including a full building lease of 100 International Drive (“100 International”), an approximately 304,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in NE Tradeport. That lease extension, done in connection with refinancing the mortgage loan on 100 International, resulted in an additional six years of lease term beyond the original lease expiration date of July 31, 2019. In fiscal 2017, Griffin completed a full building lease of approximately 23,000 square feet of office/flex space, replacing the tenant that did not renew its lease of that building. 
 There is no guarantee that an active or strong real estate market or an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants will result in leasing space that was vacant as of November 30, 2019. Additional capacity or an increase in vacancies in either the industrial/warehouse or office markets could adversely affect Griffin’s operating results by potentially resulting in longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates in Griffin’s properties or hindering renewals by existing tenants. There can be no assurances as to the directions of the Hartford, Lehigh Valley, Charlotte or Orlando real estate markets in the near future.
 In fiscal 2019, Griffin completed several land sales, the largest being the sale of approximately 280 acres  of undeveloped land in Simsbury, Connecticut (the “Simsbury Land Sale”) for approximately $7.7 million. The proceeds from the Simsbury Land Sale were placed in escrow at closing to be used as part of a like-kind exchange (a “1031 Like-Kind Exchange”) under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that enabled Griffin to defer the gain on the Simsbury Land Sale for income tax purposes. Subsequently, the sale proceeds were used to acquire two undeveloped parcels of land in Charlotte, North Carolina totaling approximately 44 acres (the “Charlotte Land”) and an approximately 14 acre parcel of undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley (the “Lehigh Valley Land”). Griffin plans to construct three industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 520,000 square feet on the Charlotte Land and an approximately 100,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building on the Lehigh Valley Land.
 In fiscal 2019, Griffin also completed the sales of approximately 116 acres of undeveloped land in East Windsor, Connecticut (the “East Windsor Land”) and the East Windsor Land’s development rights in two separate 

 
  5
 
transactions totaling approximately $1.6 million. Griffin also received approximately $0.5 million from several smaller land sales.
 In fiscal 2018, Griffin completed a land sale of approximately 49 acres of undeveloped land in Southwick, Massachusetts (the “2018 Southwick Land Sale”) for approximately $0.9 million. The proceeds from the 2018 Southwick Land Sale were placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used in the acquisition of an approximately 22 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Concord, North Carolina (the ‘Concord Land”) as part of a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange that enabled Griffin to defer the gain on the 2018 Southwick Land Sale for income tax purposes. Construction of 160 International and 180 International commenced in fiscal 2018 and both buildings were completed in fiscal 2019. Additionally, Griffin also completed one smaller land sale in fiscal 2018 for approximately $0.1 million.
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin completed several land sales, the largest being the sale of approximately 67 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing (the “2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale”) for approximately $10.3 million. The land sold under the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale is part of an approximately 268 acre parcel of land in Bloomfield and Windsor, Connecticut known as Phoenix Crossing. The proceeds from the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale were placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used in the acquisition of 215 International as part of a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. In addition to the 2017 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale, Griffin also sold approximately 76 acres of undeveloped land in Southwick, Massachusetts (the “2017 Southwick Land Sale”) for approximately $2.1 million. The proceeds from the 2017 Southwick Land Sale were also placed in escrow at closing and subsequently used for the purchase of approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in the Lehigh Valley under a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. In fiscal 2018, Griffin constructed 6975 Ambassador on the Lehigh Valley land acquired. 
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin also completed two smaller sales of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for a total of approximately $1.3 million and the sale of two small residential lots for a total of approximately $0.2 million. Griffin also recognized the remaining $0.1 million of revenue from the fiscal 2013 sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing (the “2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale”). Under the terms of the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale, Griffin and the buyer each were required to construct roadways connecting the land parcel that was sold to existing town roads. As a result of Griffin’s continuing involvement with the land sold, the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale was accounted for under the percentage of completion method, whereby revenue and gain were recognized as costs related to the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale were incurred. From the closing of the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale through fiscal 2017, when Griffin completed its required roadwork, Griffin recognized total revenue of approximately $9.0 million and a total pretax gain of approximately $6.7 million from the 2013 Phoenix Crossing Land Sale.
 Griffin may seek to acquire additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate business. Griffin continues to examine potential properties for acquisition in the Middle Atlantic, Northeast and Southeast regions and selected markets targeted by Griffin. Real estate acquisitions may or may not occur based on many factors, including real estate pricing. Griffin may commence speculative construction projects on its undeveloped land that is either currently owned or acquired in the future if it believes market conditions are favorable for such development. Griffin may also construct additional build-to-suit facilities on its undeveloped land if lease terms are favorable.
 Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its real estate assets that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin’s core industrial/warehouse development, acquisition and leasing strategy. Such sale transactions may take place either before or after obtaining development approvals and building basic infrastructure.
 Griffin’s development of its land is affected by regulatory and other constraints. Subdivision and commercial or residential development of land may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate growth. Development of Griffin’s undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies. Portions of Griffin’s landholdings in Connecticut are zoned for residential and office uses. The weakness in these markets has adversely affected Griffin, and may continue to do so in the future, by potentially lowering selling prices for land intended for such uses or delaying sales or development of such land.

     Industrial/Warehouse Properties
 Hartford, Connecticut
 All of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings, aggregating approximately 2,052,000 square feet, are located in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut and were 98% leased as of November 30, 2019. Subsequent to November 30, 2019, Griffin leased its remaining vacant industrial/warehouse space in Connecticut. A significant portion of Griffin’s industrial/warehouse development in Connecticut is in NE Tradeport, where Griffin has built and currently owns fifteen industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,837,000 square feet. Griffin owns three industrial/warehouse buildings in Connecticut that are not located in NE Tradeport, including a 165,000 square foot industrial building (“1985 Blue Hills”) in Windsor, Connecticut. Under the terms of the full building lease of 1985 Blue Hills, which runs through March 31, 2024 with several options for the tenant to renew, the tenant has the option to purchase the building from March 1, 2021 through May 1, 2021 at a purchase price that is the greater of $11.5 million or fair market value as determined under the terms of the lease.
 A summary of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:

 | Square | Square | | 
 | Footage | Footage | Percentage | 
 | Owned | Leased | Leased | 
November 30, 2017 | 1,817,000 | 1,748,000 | 96 | %
November 30, 2018 | 2,052,000 | 2,004,000 | 98 | %

Number of tenants with leases expiring | | 2 | | | 6 | | | 7 | 
Annual rental revenue (including tenant reimbursements) of expiring leases | $ | 323,000 | | $ | 1,886,000 | | $ | 3,143,000 | 
Annual rental revenue of expiring leases as a percentage of Griffin’s total fiscal 2019 rental revenue | | 1 | % | | 6 | % | | 9 | %

      In fiscal 2019, Griffin leased approximately 23,000 square feet in NE Tradeport that replaced a lease that expired and was not renewed. Also in fiscal 2019, Griffin renewed two leases aggregating approximately 80,000 square feet in NE Tradeport. The rental rates for leases in NE Tradeport that were renewed in fiscal 2019 were essentially unchanged from the rental rates of the expiring leases. Management believes that the rental rates on the two NE Tradeport leases aggregating approximately 39,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2020 are at market rates for similar space.
 The Q4 2019 CBRE|New England Marketview Report (“Q4 2019 CBRE|New England Report”) from CBRE Group, Inc. (“CBRE”), a national real estate services company, stated that the vacancy rate in the north submarket of Hartford increased to 6.5% at the end of 2019 from 5.4% at the end of 2018, and that an additional approximately 

 
  7
 
0.4 million square feet became available in 2019. Griffin’s occupancy performance in fiscal 2019 outpaced the performance of Hartford’s north submarket.
 In Connecticut, Griffin holds entitlements and/or plans (not yet approved) to develop approximately 1,180,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space on land owned by Griffin. In NE Tradeport, Griffin holds entitlements to develop an additional approximately 434,000 square feet, consisting of a new industrial/warehouse building of approximately 234,000 square feet on an approximately 34 acre parcel and approved additions aggregating approximately 200,000 square feet to two buildings, and development plans (not yet approved) for an additional approximately 248,000 square foot building. Griffin also holds entitlements to construct an additional approximately 498,000 square feet on two other land parcels in Connecticut, including approximately 267,000 square feet on a 27 acre parcel in Phoenix Crossing (the “Phoenix Crossing Parcel”) that is under agreement to be sold for approximately $3.8 million (see below). There is no guarantee that Griffin will develop the entitled square footage or sell the entitled land parcels to a third party for development.
 Griffin owns an additional 99 acres of undeveloped land within NE Tradeport, 60 acres of which are in Windsor and the abutting 39 acres of which are in East Granby. Full approvals for the development of this remaining land for industrial use are not in place, and the East Granby land would require a zone change for industrial development. Parts of such acreage may not be developable. Griffin believes that additional infrastructure improvements, which may be significant, may be required to obtain approvals to develop portions of this land, particularly the land in East Granby. Griffin expects to continue to direct much of its real estate efforts in Connecticut on the construction and leasing of industrial/warehouse facilities in NE Tradeport and other suitably located land currently owned. As of November 30, 2019, Griffin also owns approximately 76 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing (including the Phoenix Crossing Parcel) that is zoned for industrial and commercial development.
 As of November 30, 2019, approximately $84.2 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in its Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings, approximately $2.9 million was invested (net book value) by Griffin in the undeveloped NE Tradeport land and approximately $1.5 million was invested in the undeveloped Phoenix Crossing land. As of November 30, 2019, sixteen of Griffin’s Connecticut industrial/warehouse buildings were mortgaged for an aggregate of approximately $81.6 million. 
 On January 7, 2020, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell the Phoenix Crossing Parcel for a purchase price of approximately $3.8 million, before transaction costs. Completion of this transaction is contingent on a number of factors, including the buyer entering into a lease agreement with a third-party who would occupy the development on the land to be acquired and obtaining all necessary final permits from governmental authorities for its specific development plans. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all. 
 Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania
 Since entering the Lehigh Valley market in fiscal 2010, Griffin has grown its portfolio to six industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 1,317,000 square feet as of November 30, 2019. A summary of Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:
 | Square | Square | | 
 | Footage | Footage | Percentage | 
 | Owned | Leased | Leased | 
November 30, 2017 | 1,183,000 | 1,183,000 | 100 | %

      In fiscal 2019, Griffin leased approximately 64,000 square feet in 6975 Ambassador. Subsequent to November 30, 2019, the balance of 6975 Ambassador was substantially leased. Griffin also acquired the Lehigh Valley Land for approximately $1.9 million in fiscal 2019 using the proceeds from the Simsbury Land Sale to complete a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. Griffin expects to build an approximately 100,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building on the Lehigh Valley Land. Approximately $71.2 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s Lehigh Valley buildings as of November 30, 2019. As of November 30, 2019, all of the Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings, except 6975 Ambassador, were mortgaged for a total of approximately $47.0 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2019, Griffin entered into a $15.0 million nonrecourse mortgage loan collateralized by 6975 Ambassador and 871 Nestle Way, an approximately 120,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley. Approximately $3.2 million of the loan proceeds were used to repay the mortgage loan on 871 Nestle Way that was scheduled to mature on January 27, 2020.
 Management believes that a lease for approximately 201,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space that is scheduled to expire in fiscal 2020 will not be renewed. The vacancy rate of Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse properties, in the counties where Griffin’s Lehigh Valley properties are located, as reported in CBRE’s Q4 2019 Marketview Lehigh Valley PA Industrial Report (the “Q4 2019 CBRE Lehigh Valley Report”) was 4.2% at the end of 2019, with a net absorption of approximately 4.2 million square feet in 2019.
 Charlotte, North Carolina
 In fiscal 2017, Griffin entered the Charlotte, North Carolina market when it acquired 215 International in Concord, North Carolina, in the greater Charlotte area, which was 74% leased when it was acquired. Subsequent to the purchase of 215 International, one of the tenants in that building leased the remaining approximately 73,000 square feet that had been vacant at the time the building was acquired. A summary of Griffin’s Charlotte, North Carolina industrial/warehouse square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s Charlotte, North Carolina industrial/warehouse building scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:
 | Square | Square | |

      In fiscal 2019, Griffin completed and placed in service two industrial/warehouse buildings, 160 International and 180 International, aggregating approximately 283,000 square feet on the Concord Land and entered into two leases aggregating approximately 105,000 square feet of 160 International. In fiscal 2019, Griffin also acquired two 

 
  9
 
undeveloped parcels of land in Charlotte, North Carolina totaling approximately 44 acres on which Griffin plans to construct three industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 520,000 square feet. The purchase price of approximately $5.6 million for the Charlotte Land was paid using proceeds from the Simsbury Land Sale to complete a 1031 Like-Kind Exchange. As of November 30, 2019, approximately $34.5 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s three industrial/warehouse buildings in North Carolina, and 215 International was mortgaged under a nonrecourse mortgage loan for approximately $11.7 million. 
 The Charlotte, North Carolina industrial real estate market remained strong in 2019. CBRE’s Q4 2019 Marketview Charlotte Industrial Report reported a vacancy rate of 5.0% for warehouse space at the end of 2019, as compared 5.3% at the end of 2018 and absorption of 5.3 million square feet of warehouse space in 2019, as compared to 4.8 million in 2018. 
 Orlando, Florida
 In fiscal 2019, Griffin entered the Orlando, Florida market by acquiring 7466 Chancellor, which is fully leased to a single tenant. The lease for 7466 Chancellor runs through January 31, 2025. Griffin utilized its acquisition line of credit (the “Acquisition Credit Line”) with Webster Bank, N.A. (“Webster Bank”) to finance a portion of the acquisition of 7466 Chancellor, and, as of November 30, 2019, there was a balance outstanding on Griffin’s Acquisition Credit Line of approximately $5.9 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2019, Griffin repaid the full amount outstanding on its Acquisition Credit Line with proceeds from a mortgage loan secured by 7466 Chancellor. 
 On January 2, 2020, Griffin entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 108,000 square foot fully leased industrial/warehouse building in Orlando, Florida for approximately $7.9 million. On January 13, 2020, Griffin entered into an agreement with a different seller to acquire an approximately 68,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Orlando, Florida that is approximately 32% leased for approximately $5.7 million. There is no guarantee that either of these building acquisitions will be completed under their current terms, or at all. 
 Office/Flex Properties
 All of Griffin’s office/flex properties are located in Griffin Center in Windsor and Bloomfield, Connecticut and Griffin Center South in Bloomfield, which are in the north submarket of Hartford. In Griffin Center, Griffin currently owns two multi‑story office buildings that have an aggregate of approximately 161,000 square feet, a single-story office building of approximately 48,000 square feet and a small restaurant building of approximately 7,200 square feet. In Griffin Center South, Griffin currently owns eight office/flex buildings with an aggregate of approximately 217,000 square feet of single-story office/flex space. Griffin’s office/flex square footage was approximately 70% leased as of November 30, 2019.
 A summary of Griffin’s office/flex square footage at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and leases in Griffin’s office/flex buildings scheduled to expire during the next three fiscal years are as follows:

 | Square | Square | | 
 | Footage | Footage | Percentage |

 As of November 30, 2019, Griffin’s total office/flex space of approximately 433,000 square feet comprised approximately 10% of Griffin’s total square footage. Griffin expects that its office/flex space will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total space as Griffin plans to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through the acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired, or both. Management believes that the rental rates on the leases for office/flex space of approximately 22,000 square feet that are scheduled to expire in fiscal 2020 are at market rates for similar space.
 The Hartford office/flex market remained weak in 2019, as evidenced by vacancy rates at the end of 2019, as stated in the Q4 2019 CBRE|New England Report, of 18.3% for the overall Hartford market. The vacancy rate in the north submarket of Hartford decreased slightly to 31.8% from 33.6% at the end of 2018.
 In fiscal 2019, there was a net reduction of approximately 17,000 square feet of office/flex space under lease that was the result of several lease extensions and relocations whereby the tenants reduced their space leased. Such relocations included a tenant in Griffin’s two multi-story office buildings in Griffin Center in Windsor, Connecticut that downsized from approximately 34,000 square feet under leases that were set to expire on July 31, 2019, to approximately 25,000 square feet under a new six-year lease. In fiscal 2019, Griffin renewed a lease for approximately 29,000 square feet of office/flex space at a rental rate approximately 13% lower than the expiring rental rate for five and a half years. Griffin also renewed a lease for approximately 15,000 square feet of office/flex space at the same rate as the expiring lease for a two-year term. There was another lease for approximately 7,000 square feet of office/flex space, whereby the tenant expanded its leased space slightly and renewed for a term of five years. That rental rate is approximately 11% lower than the expiring rental rate. 
 Currently there are approximately 156 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center and approximately 75 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center South that are owned by Griffin. As of November 30, 2019, approximately $17.1 million was invested (net book value) in Griffin’s office/flex buildings and approximately $1.6 million was invested by Griffin in the undeveloped land in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Griffin’s two multi‑story office buildings in Griffin Center are mortgaged for approximately $4.2 million as of November 30, 2019, and Griffin’s single story office building in Griffin Center and the eight single-story office/flex buildings, an industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South and an industrial/warehouse building in Phoenix Crossing are the collateral for Griffin’s $19.5 million revolving line of credit.
 Residential Developments
 Simsbury, Connecticut
 Several years ago, Griffin filed plans for a proposed residential development (“Meadowood”) in Simsbury, Connecticut (“Simsbury”). After several years of litigation with Simsbury regarding Meadowood, a settlement was reached. The settlement terms included, among other items, approval for up to 296 homes, certain remediation measures and offsite road improvements to be performed by Griffin and the purchase by Simsbury of a portion of the Meadowood land for open space. The sale of a portion of the Meadowood land to Simsbury closed in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2012, Griffin completed the required offsite road improvements and in fiscal 2014, Griffin completed the required remediation work. In the 2019 fourth quarter, management decided to pursue alternatives to a large scale long-term residential development for Meadowood that would enable Griffin to realize proceeds in a more timely manner that could be redeployed by Griffin towards its key strategy of increasing its industrial/warehouse portfolio. As a result of these actions, in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, Griffin recorded an impairment loss of $3.1 million to lower the carrying value of the real estate assets of Meadowood to their estimated fair value of approximately $5.4 million. 
 On February 3, 2020, Griffin entered into an option agreement (the “Meadowood Option Agreement”) with a national land conservation organization (the “Conservation Organization”) to sell the approximately 277 acres of Meadowood (the “Meadowood Land”). For a minimal fee, the Meadowood Option Agreement grants the Conservation Organization the right to purchase the Meadowood Land for open space and farmland preservation whereby Griffin would receive net proceeds of approximately $5.4 million, if the purchase option is exercised. The Meadowood Option Agreement grants the Conservation Organization an initial term of twelve months, with one six-month extension, to exercise its option and acquire the Meadowood Land. Completion of a sale of the Meadowood Land contemplated under the Meadowood Option Agreement is subject to several contingencies, including the satisfactory outcome of due diligence by the Conservation Organization and the Conservation Organization securing funding from several public and

private sources to acquire the Meadowood Land. There is no guarantee that a sale of the Meadowood Land will be completed under the current terms of the Meadowood Option Agreement, or at all.
 Suffield, Connecticut
 In fiscal 2006, Griffin completed the infrastructure for a fifty lot residential subdivision in Suffield, Connecticut called Stratton Farms. Griffin sold twenty‑five residential lots in Stratton Farms to a local homebuilder in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. Griffin has subsequently sold seven additional lots, including the sale of one residential lot in fiscal 2019. As of November 30, 2019, Griffin held eighteen Stratton Farms residential lots. The book value for Stratton Farms was approximately $1.0 million at November 30, 2019.  Other Land
 Concurrent with Griffin’s sale in fiscal 2014 of its landscape nursery business, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. (“Imperial”), Griffin and the buyer, Monrovia Connecticut LLC (“Monrovia”) entered into a Lease and Option Agreement, which was amended in fiscal 2016 (as amended, the “Imperial Lease”) pursuant to which Monrovia leased Imperial’s production nursery located in Granby and East Granby, Connecticut (the “Connecticut Farm”) for a ten-year period. The Imperial Lease grants Monrovia options to extend the term for up to an additional fifteen years and to purchase the land, land improvements and other operating assets that were used by Imperial on the Connecticut Farm during the first thirteen years of the lease period for $9.5 million, or $7.0 million if only a certain portion of the Connecticut Farm is purchased, subject in each case to certain adjustments as provided for in the Imperial Lease. 
 Prior to the fiscal 2009 third quarter, Imperial operated a production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the “Florida Farm”). In fiscal 2009, Imperial shut down its growing operations on the Florida Farm and leased that facility to a grower of landscape nursery plants. After the expiration of that lease, Griffin entered into a new three-year lease of the Florida Farm with another grower that started July 1, 2016. On December 18, 2017, the tenant leasing the Florida Farm filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and subsequently rejected the Florida Farm Lease effective September 15, 2018. The lease of the Florida Farm had a rental rate of $0.5 million per year at the time it was terminated. On September 28, 2018, Griffin and the tenant entered into a Stipulated Order whereby Griffin agreed to allow the tenant to remain on the Florida Farm through October 31, 2018 at the then current rental rate under the Florida Farm Lease. Griffin received all rent due under the Florida Farm Lease and the Stipulated Order. In fiscal 2019, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell the Florida Farm, but subsequent to November 30 , 2019 the buyer notified Griffin that they were not moving forward with the proposed transaction. Griffin is currently marketing the Florida Farm for sale or lease.
 In fiscal 2019, Griffin leased approximately 364 acres of undeveloped land in Connecticut and Massachusetts to local farmers. Approximately 427 acres and 560 acres were leased to local farmers in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The revenue generated from the leasing of farmland is not material to Griffin’s total revenue.
 On December 10, 2019, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the “East Granby/Windsor Option Agreement”) whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive one-year option, in exchange for a nominal fee, to purchase approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in East Granby and Windsor, Connecticut. The purchase price has a range of a minimum of $6.0 million to a maximum of $7.95 million based upon the final approved use of the land. The buyer may extend the option period for up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. The land subject to the East Granby/Windsor Option Agreement does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer’s planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the East Granby/Windsor Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process for the buyer’s projected use and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of land as contemplated under the East Granby/Windsor Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2019, Griffin had 32 employees, including 31 full‑time employees. Presently, none of Griffin’s employees are represented by a union. Griffin believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory.

 Competition
 The market for leasing industrial/warehouse space and office/flex space is highly competitive. Griffin competes for tenants with owners of numerous properties in the areas where Griffin’s buildings are located. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin. Griffin’s real estate business competes on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities.
 There is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. Griffin competes for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse properties with real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity. 
 Regulation: Environmental Matters
 Under various federal and state laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate properly such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real estate properties, Griffin may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. The value of Griffin’s land may be affected by the presence of residual chemicals from the prior use of the land for farming, principally on a portion of the land that is intended for residential use. In the event that Griffin is unable to remediate adequately any of its land intended for residential use, Griffin’s ability to develop such property for its intended purposes would be materially affected.
 Griffin periodically reviews its properties for the purpose of evaluating such properties’ compliance with applicable federal and state environmental laws. In connection with the sale of Imperial, Griffin incurred a small amount of costs to remediate a small area of the Connecticut Farm that is leased to Monrovia under the Imperial Lease. As of the date of this Annual Report, Griffin is in discussions with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection regarding findings of exceedances of certain residual pesticides on a limited portion of the Connecticut Farm being leased to Monrovia. At this time, Griffin does not anticipate experiencing, in the next twelve months, any material expense in complying with such laws on any of its properties. Griffin may incur remediation costs in the future in connection with its development operations. Such costs are not expected to be significant as compared to expected proceeds from development projects or property sales.
