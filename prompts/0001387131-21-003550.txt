*Tonmya has been conditionally accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the proposed trade name for TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. TNX-102 SL is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication.
 
 Business Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, licensing, acquiring and developing small molecules and biologics to treat and prevent human disease and alleviate suffering. Tonix’s portfolio is primarily composed of central nervous system, or CNS, and immunology product candidates. The CNS portfolio includes both small molecules and biologics to treat pain, neurologic, psychiatric and addiction conditions. The immunology portfolio includes vaccines to prevent infectious diseases and biologics to address organ rejection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Our lead programs are TNX-102 SL*, a sublingual tablet for the management of fibromyalgia, or FM, and TNX-1800**, a live replicating virus vaccine to protect against COVID-19. 
 
Our most advanced CNS product candidate is TNX-102 SL*, a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, designed for bedtime administration. TNX-102 SL has active investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for FM, posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, agitation in Alzheimer’s disease, or AAD, and alcohol use disorder, or AUD. TNX-102 SL is in mid-Phase 3 development for the management of FM which is a pain disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain, non-restorative sleep, fatigue and impaired cognition.  We reported positive results from its Phase 3 RELIEF study in December 2020 and expect interim analysis data from a second Phase 3 study, RALLY, in the third quarter of 20211, followed by topline data in the fourth quarter of 2021. We completed enrollment of 50% of participants in the RALLY study in March 2021. For TNX-102 SL in PTSD, we completed the Phase 3 RECOVERY trial and reported topline results in the fourth quarter of 2020 in which TNX-102 SL did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. As a next step, we intend to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to discuss potential new endpoints for the indication of treatment of PTSD and also to discuss potential endpoints for an indication of PTSD-related Sleep Disturbance. PTSD is a serious psychiatric condition that develops in response to experiencing a traumatic event. The AAD program is Phase 2 ready with an active IND and FDA Fast Track designation. AAD, which includes emotional lability, restlessness, irritability, and aggression, is one of the most distressing and debilitating of the behavioral complications of Alzheimer’s disease. The AUD program is also Phase 2 ready with an active IND. AUD is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over alcohol intake, and a negative emotional state when not using alcohol. 
 

Other CNS candidates in development include TNX-1900* (intranasal potentiated oxytocin), which is in development as a candidate for prophylaxis of chronic migraine and for the treatment of craniofacial pain, insulin resistance and related conditions. TNX-1900 was acquired from Trigemina, Inc. in 2020 and licensed from Stanford University in 2020. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA in the second quarter of 2021 and initiate a Phase 2 study in migraine in the third quarter of 2021. Tonix also licensed technology to use TNX-1900 for the treatment of insulin resistance from the University of Geneva. TNX-2900* is another intranasal oxytocin-based therapeutic in development for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome, or PWS. The technology for TNX-2900 was licensed from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. PWS, an orphan condition, is a rare genetic disorder of failure to thrive in infancy, associated with uncontrolled appetite later in life.

TNX-601 CR* (tianeptine oxalate and naloxone controlled-release tablets) is another CNS product candidate,
 in development as a daytime treatment for major depressive disorder, or depression, as well as for PTSD and neurocognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use. We completed a Phase 1 trial for formulation development outside of the U.S. and expect to file an IND for TNX-601 for depression in the U.S. in 2021.
 
TNX-1300** (double-mutant cocaine esterase) is also in Tonix’s CNS portfolio and is in Phase 2 development for the treatment of life-threatening cocaine intoxication. TNX-1300 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, or BTD by the FDA. TNX-1300 was licensed from Columbia University in 2019 after a Phase 2 study showed that it rapidly and efficiently disintegrates cocaine in the blood of volunteers who had received intravenous, or i.v., cocaine. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 open-label safety study of TNX-1300 in an emergency room setting in the second quarter of 2021.
 
Our immunology portfolio includes vaccines to prevent infectious diseases and biologics to address organ rejection, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Our lead vaccine candidate, TNX-1800**, is a live replicating vaccine based on the horsepox viral vector platform to protect against COVID-19, primarily by eliciting a T cell immune response. We reported positive immune response data in non-human primates in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expect to report efficacy data from animal challenge studies using live SARS-CoV-2 in the first quarter of 2021. TNX-801**, a live horsepox virus vaccine for percutaneous administration, is in the pre-IND stages of development to protect against smallpox and monkeypox. Both TNX-1800 and TNX-801 are based on the proprietary horsepox viral vector platform.
 
TNX-2100** is a skin test we are developing to measure SARS-CoV-2 exposure and T cell immunity. It is an intradermal test to measure delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to SARS-CoV-2. We have manufactured GMP peptides designed to stimulate SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells and expect to submit an IND to the FDA in the second quarter of 2021 and initiate clinical trials in the second half of 2021.
 
TNX-1500** is monoclonal antibody, or mAb, directed against CD40-ligand, or CD40L, engineered to modulate binding to Fc receptors, that is being developed to prevent and treat organ transplant rejection and autoimmune conditions.
 
Finally, our preclinical pipeline includes TNX-1600*, TNX-1700**, TNX-701* and TNX-2300**. TNX-1600 is an inhibitor of the reuptake of neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine (a triple reuptake inhibitor). TNX-1600 was licensed from Wayne State University in 2019 and is being developed as a daytime treatment for PTSD, depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. TNX-1700 is a recombinant modified form of Trefoil Family Factor 2, or rTFF2, that was licensed from Columbia University in 2019, and is a biologic being developed to treat gastric and pancreatic cancers. TNX-701 is an undisclosed small molecule, which is being developed to prevent deleterious effects of radiation exposure which has the potential to be used as a medical countermeasure to improve biodefense. Tonix is also developing TNX-2300** as a second COVID-19 vaccine under an option agreement with Kansas State university. TNX-2300 is a live replicating viral vector based on the bovine parainfluenza virus.

 TNX-102 SL – Fibromyalgia 
 
TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing CBP for sublingual administration. TNX-102 SL employs a proprietary protective eutectic formulation of CBP, Protectic™, which enables rapid systemic exposure and increased bioavailability through transmucosal absorption. We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of FM. TNX-102 SL for FM is a non-opioid, centrally-acting analgesic that could potentially provide a new therapeutic option for FM patients. In September 2016, we interrupted the development of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM to focus on the treatment of PTSD. Our previous development efforts for TNX-102 SL in FM studied the 2.8 mg dose in a Phase 2 and a Phase 3 study. Based on our experience with higher doses of TNX-102 SL, 5.6 mg, in PTSD, we restarted the clinical program in FM using TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg. We met with the FDA in March 2019 to discuss the clinical development plan and the next Phase 3 study design to support the FM indication. We received guidance from the FDA to advance FM using TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg. We reported positive data for the RELIEF Phase 3 trial (F304) in December 2020. We are now in mid-Phase 3 development for the management of fibromyalgia and are currently conducting a second Phase 3 study, the RALLY (F306) study, which started enrolling patients in September 2020. Pending agreement with FDA, we plan to conduct an interim analysis, or IA, and we expect interim analysis results from this study in the third quarter of 2021 and topline data in the fourth quarter of 2021. The program in FM is expected to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for FDA approval.
 
TNX-1800 – Potential COVID-19 Vaccine
 
TNX-1800 is a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, based on a synthetic modified version of live horsepox virus grown in cell culture. TNX-1800 is engineered to express the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.
 
TNX-1800 is based on our proprietary horsepox vector platform. Horsepox is closely related to vaccinia vaccines, which are a group of orthopoxviruses that have been used as smallpox vaccines and as experimental vectors for certain other disease-related antigens. Orthopoxviruses, like vaccinia, can be engineered to express foreign genes and have been explored as platforms for vaccine development because they possess: (1) large packaging capacity for exogenous DNA inserts, (2) precise virus-specific control of exogenous gene insert expression, (3) lack of persistence or genomic integration in the host, (4) strong immunogenicity as a vaccine, (5) ability to rapidly generate vector/insert constructs, (6) potential to be manufactured at industrial scale, and (7) ability to provide direct antigen presentation and T cell-mediated immune response. Although vaccinia vectors are available, different orthopoxvirus strains may behave differently as vectors in part because of their different repertoire of genes that modulate immune responses and host range. Potential advantages of horsepox-based vaccines include the strong immunogenicity we observed for TNX-801 in macaques and mice with good tolerability. The protein synthesis connected with a replicating live virus vaccine provides direct antigen presentation, which can stimulate cellular, or T Cell-mediated immunity in addition to humoral, or antibody-mediated, immunity.
 
In November 2020, we reported positive immune response results in non-human primates following vaccination using TNX-1800. The research is part of an ongoing collaboration between us, Southern Research Institute and the University of Alberta. At Day 14 after a single vaccination, all eight of the TNX-1800 vaccinated animals made anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (≥1:40 titer) and, as expected, none of the eight TNX-801 vaccinated control animals, or any of the four animals in the placebo group, made anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (≤1:10 titer). The level of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production was similar between the low and high dose TNX-1800 groups (1 x 106 Plaque Forming Units [PFU] and 3 x 106 PFU, respectively). TNX-1800 was well tolerated at both doses. In the second phase of the study, the TNX-1800 vaccinated and control animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Results are expected in the first quarter of 2021.
 
The further development of TNX-1800 for human clinical trials will require manufacturing according to Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, standards and sufficient animal testing. Tonix expects to initiate a Phase 1 safety study using TNX-1800 in humans in the second half of 2021.
 
We have filed a provisional patent on TNX-1800’s technology. In addition, we expect TNX-1800 to be eligible for 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA.

TNX-801 – Potential Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine
 
TNX-801 is a novel potential smallpox-preventing vaccine based on a synthetic version of live horsepox virus, grown in cell culture. Though it shares structural characteristics with vaccinia-based vaccines, TNX-801 has unique properties that we believe indicate potential safety advantages over existing live replicating vaccinia virus vaccines, which have been associated with adverse side effects such as myopericarditis in some individuals.  Emergent BioSolutions’ ACAM2000® is the only replicating vaccinia virus vaccine currently approved by the FDA to protect against smallpox. We believe replicating virus vaccines have potential efficacy advantages over non-replicating vaccines, relating to the stimulation of cell mediated immunity. Bavarian Nordic’s Jynneos® is the only non-replicating virus vaccine currently approved by the FDA to protect against smallpox and monkeypox. We believe TNX-801 has the potential to have improved tolerability relative to replicating vaccinia vaccines and the potential to have improved efficacy relative to non-replicating vaccinia vaccines.
 
Smallpox was eradicated by a World Health Organization program that vaccinated individuals with live replicating vaccinia vaccines wherever smallpox appeared. In the 1970s, vaccination of civilians to protect against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security and a proportion of military personnel, including members of the Global Response Force, continue to be vaccinated. We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for the U.S. strategic national stockpile and for potential widespread immunization in the event of malicious reintroduction of variola, the virus that causes smallpox.
 
Monkeypox is a growing problem in certain regions of Africa. Some cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of Africa in patients who had been infected while in Africa.
 
In January 2020 at the American Society of Microbiology Biothreats conference, we reported the results of experiments on TNX-801 that were performed in collaboration with Southern Research, that showed TNX-801 vaccinated macaques were protected against monkeypox challenge. The TNX-801 vaccinated macaques showed no overt clinical signs after monkeypox challenge. Furthermore, eight of eight animals vaccinated with two different doses of TNX-801 showed no lesions after monkeypox challenge.
 
We have filed a patent to protect the TNX-801 vaccine candidate. In addition, we expect that TNX-801 will be eligible for 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity under the PPACA. Following the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, a law designed to help accelerate medical product development, we believe TNX-801 will qualify as a medical countermeasure and would therefore be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon receiving FDA approval. However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023. If TNX-801 does not receive FDA approval by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed by the FDA. 
 
We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan, to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure TNX-801.We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND study.
 
 TNX-102 SL – Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD. TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg was studied in the first Phase 3 study for military-related PTSD, HONOR (P301), which was discontinued after the results of an interim analysis indicated the study met a pre-defined threshold p-value for futility. Retrospective analysis of this Phase 3 study revealed a treatment effect in participants who experienced trauma less than or equal to nine years prior to screening. This analysis defined an optimal treatment window for TNX-102 SL in PTSD within nine years after the index trauma that resulted in PTSD. This retrospective analysis guided the design of the Phase 3 RECOVERY (P302) study, which was initiated in March 2019. Based on interim analysis results of the first 50% of enrolled participants of the RECOVERY trial, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the study for futility as TNX-102 SL was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint after 12 weeks. We stopped enrollment of new participants but continued to study those participants enrolled until completion. We reported topline data in December 2020, which revealed that the RECOVERY study did not achieve statistical significance in the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 12 in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) between TNX-102 SL and placebo (p=0.343) (TNX-102 SL separated from placebo in the first key secondary endpoint, Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) scale (p=0.024) and in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), (p=0.007). TNX-102 SL also trended for improvement on the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale (p=0.055), consistent with the proposed mechanism of targeting the PTSD sleep disturbance. TNX-102 SL is generally well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. We plan to meet with the FDA to discuss potential new endpoints for the indication of treatment of PTSD and also to discuss potential endpoints for an indication of PTSD-related Sleep Disturbance. Sleep disturbance is a core symptom of PTSD and believed to play roles in vulnerability, onset, progression and chronicity. Treating sleep disturbance is recognized as a clinically valid approach for addressing global improvement in PTSD. We plan to begin enrolling a Phase 3 study of police in Kenya in 2021. The program in PTSD is expected to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for FDA approval.
 

TNX-102 SL – Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease (AAD)
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of AAD, which has been designated as a Fast Track development program by the FDA. The program is ready for a Phase 2 study which could potentially serve as a pivotal efficacy study to support NDA approval. The program in AAD is expected to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for FDA approval.
 
TNX-102 SL – Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We announced clearance of the IND for AUD in August of 2020. The FDA cleared the IND for the initiation of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. The program in AUD is expected to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for FDA approval.

TNX-1900 – Migraine and craniofacial pain 
 
We are developing TNX-1900 (intranasal potentiated oxytocin) as a candidate for prophylaxis of chronic migraine and for the treatment of insulin resistance and related conditions. TNX-1900 was acquired from Trigemina in 2020 and licensed from Stanford University in 2020. Oxytocin is a naturally occurring human peptide hormone that acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It was originally approved by the FDA as Pitocin®, an intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection drug, for use in pregnant women to induce labor. An intranasal form of oxytocin was marketed in the U.S. by Novartis to assist in the production of breast milk as Syntocinon® (oxytocin nasal 40 units/ml), but the product was withdrawn, and the New Drug Application (NDA) has been discontinued. TNX-1900 is in the pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) stage and have not been approved for any indication. We intend to submit an IND in the second quarter of 2021 and initiate a Phase 2 study in the third quarter of 2021.
 
TNX-2900 – Prader-Willi Syndrome
 
TNX-2900 (intranasal potentiated oxytocin) is also based on our patented intranasal potentiated oxytocin formulation, like TNX-1900. TNX 2900 is being developed for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome. We licensed technology using oxytocin-based therapeutics for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and non-organic failure to thrive disease from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm). The licensing agreement has been negotiated and signed by Inserm Transfert, the private subsidiary of Inserm, on behalf of Inserm (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Aix-Marseille Université and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Toulouse. Prader-Willi syndrome is recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity and affects males and females with equal frequency and all races and ethnicities. There is currently no approved treatment for either the suckling deficit in infants or the obesity and hyperphagia in older children associated with Prader-Willi syndrome. Since Prader-Willi syndrome is an orphan disease that occurs in approximately one in 15,000 births, we plan at the appropriate time to submit an application to the FDA for Orphan Drug designation for TNX-2900. 
 
TNX-601 CR – Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD and Neurocognitive Dysfunction from Corticosteroids
 
We are developing TNX-601 CR (tianeptine oxalate and naloxone controlled release tablets) for the treatment of major depressive disorder, or depression, PTSD, and neurocognitive dysfunction from corticosteroid therapies. TNX-601 CR is a new, controlled release formulation of a novel salt of tianeptine. An immediate release form of tianeptine, with three times a day dosing, has been marketed outside of the U.S. for the treatment of depression for several decades. Tianeptine is believed to work in depression as a modulator of the glutamatergic system. Tianeptine and its major metabolite MC5 are also weak agonists of the mu-opioid receptor.  Neither tianeptine nor MC5 have been shown to bind other neurotransmitter receptors. No tianeptine product is FDA approved in the U.S., but some products containing tianeptine are marketed as nutritional supplements in some states. Other states have restricted the use of tianeptine as a controlled substance. In animals, tianeptine has been shown to reverse the adverse neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of extreme stress and elevated corticosteroid exposure. Tianeptine’s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than TNX-102 SL. Several preliminary clinical studies conducted by others have suggested that tianeptine immediate release tablets have activity in combat and military-related PTSD. We reported the results of a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study in the fourth quarter of 2019, performed outside of the U.S., that was the basis for selecting the TNX-601 CR formulation with controlled release characteristics suitable for once-daily dosing. TNX-601 CR is formulated with naloxone to prevent illicit parenteral abuse. Tonix is planning to start a Phase 2 study, pending IND clearance from the FDA, in depression in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
 TNX-1300 – Cocaine Intoxication 
 
We licensed TNX-1300 from Columbia University in May 2019. We are developing TNX-1300 for the treatment of cocaine intoxication.  TNX-1300 (T172R/G173Q double-mutant cocaine esterase 200 mg) is a recombinant protein enzyme produced through rDNA technology in a non-disease-producing strain of E. coli bacteria.  Cocaine Esterase (CocE) was identified in a bacterium (Rhodococcus) that uses cocaine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen and that grows in soil surrounding coca plants.  The gene encoding CocE was identified and the protein was extensively characterized. CocE catalyzes the breakdown of cocaine into metabolites ecgonine methyl ester and benzoic acid.  Wild-type CocE is unstable at body temperature, so targeted mutations were introduced in the CocE gene and resulted in the T172R/G173Q double-mutant CocE, which shows activity for approximately 6 hours at human body temperature. In a Phase 2 study of volunteer cocaine abusers conducted prior to Tonix licensing the program, TNX-1300 was well tolerated at 100 mg or 200 mg i.v. doses and rapidly, within a few minutes, interrupted cocaine effects after cocaine 50 mg i.v. challenge. TNX-1300 has been granted BTD by the FDA for the treatment of cocaine intoxication. In August 2019, we met with the FDA to seek guidance on the nonclinical study plans to support the clinical development of TNX-1300. We intend to initiate a Phase 2 open-label safety study in an emergency department (ED) setting in the second quarter of 2021.

TNX-2100 – COVID-19 Skin Test
 
TNX-2100 (SARS-CoV-2 epitope peptide mixtures for intradermal administration) is designed to measure T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as a diagnostic skin test. TNX-2100 measures the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. There currently is no FDA approved laboratory test available to measure T cell immune responses to CoV-2. The research test currently performed by specialized laboratories is called intracytoplasmic cytokine staining, or ICS, and is not standardized. FDA recently granted Emergency Use Authorization to T-Detect™ COVID from Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, which is based on a novel technology that identifies rearranged TCRβ sequences from patient genomic DNA and uses a proprietary algorithm to compare patient sequences to a database of sequences from patients known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. From the available information, it appears T-Detect COVID can assess past infection with SARS-CoV-2 by traces of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, but it does not appear to be a measure of functional T cell immunity. T cell immunity to CoV-2 persists longer than antibody immunity, is sometimes present in the absence of a measurable antibody response and is believed to provide an important element of protection against serious COVID-19 illness after infection with CoV-2. Tonix’s proposed skin test has the potential to serve as: 1) a biomarker for cellular immunity and protective immunity; 2) a method to stratify participants in COVID-19 vaccine trials by immune status; 3) an endpoint in COVID-19 vaccine trials, and 4) a biomarker of durability of vaccine protection. Discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, the DTH reaction has been used for more than a century as a clinical test for T cell-mediated immune reactions. In the 1940s, Landsteiner and Chase demonstrated that the reaction was mediated by the cellular and not the antibody arm of the immune system. When small quantities of antigen are injected intradermally, a hallmark response is elicited which includes induration, swelling and monocytic infiltration into the site of the lesion within 24 to 48 hours. This reaction has been shown to be dependent on the presence of memory T cells. Both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown to participate in this response. DTH skin tests have been commonly used to detect T cell responses to tuberculosis, fungal pathogens, and mumps virus. Tonix expects to initiate clinical trials in the second half of 2021, upon receiving IND clearance by the FDA.
 

TNX-1500 – anti-CD40L mAb
 
TNX-1500 (monoclonal antibody anti-CD40-L or anti-CD154) is a third-generation monoclonal antibody, or mAb, currently in preclinical development as a potential first line monotherapy for preventing or treating organ transplant rejection autoimmunity. Several studies have shown mAbs that react with the same molecular target as TNX-1500 to be active in the treatment of human systemic lupus erythematosus and in transplant rejection.  TNX-1500 is specifically designed to retain the efficacy of anti-CD40L mAbs while mitigating potential side effects. In August 2019, we announced a research collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston for the testing of TNX-1500 for the prevention of heart transplant rejection. In January 2021, we announced a second research collaboration with MGH for the testing of TNX-1500 for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection. We expect to have GMP material available in the third quarter of 2021.
 
TNX-2300 – Potential COVID-19 Vaccine
 
We are party to a preclinical research and option agreement with Kansas State University to develop a vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 that utilizes a novel live virus vaccine vector platform and the CD40-L, to stimulate T cell immunity. Under the research agreement, Kansas State will advance preclinical development of a live replicating virus vaccine to protect against COVID-19 based on bovine parainfluenza virus. Attenuated bovine parainfluenza virus has previously been shown to be an effective antigen delivery vector in humans. Reports of testing in non-human primates, indicate the attenuated BPI3V was well tolerated, infectious, and immunogenic. The vector is well suited for mucosal immunization using a nasal atomizer, but it can also be delivered parenterally. The technology also includes CD40-ligand, as a molecular stimulant to trigger strong immunity including T cell responses. The vaccine is designed to potentially stimulate immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We expect data from small animals to measure efficacy in challenge studies using SARS-CoV-2 in the second quarter of 2021.
Other Preclinical Product Candidates
 

● | TNX-1600 – PTSD, Depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TNX-1600 was licensed from Wayne State in August 2019 in a transaction that included an asset acquisition agreement with TRImaran, a biopharmaceutical company that had previously licensed the technology from Wayne State.  TNX-1600 is a triple reuptake inhibitor, which inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. TNX-1600 is in development to treat PTSD, depression and ADHD and potentially other central nervous system disorders. TNX-1600 is a new chemical entity and is being developed as first line monotherapy, as an oral daytime treatment. 
 

● | TNX-1700 – Gastric and Pancreatic Cancers
--+------------------------------------------

 TNX-1700 (rTFF2) was licensed from Columbia University in September 2019. TNX-1700 is a biologic molecule currently in preclinical development as a treatment for gastric and pancreatic cancers. TFF2 is a small, secreted protein, encoded by the TFF2 gene in humans, that is expressed in gastrointestinal mucosa where it functions to protect and repair mucosal tissue. TFF2 is also expressed at low levels in splenic immune cells and is now appreciated to have intravascular roles in spleen and in the microenvironment of tumors. In gastric cancer, TFF2 is epigenetically silenced, and TFF2 is suggested to be protective against cancer development through several mechanisms. The mechanism of action of rTFF2 is different from anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and Tonix is studying rTFF2 to determine whether there are additive or synergistic effects of combining rTFF2 with other anti-neoplastic treatments in gastric and pancreatic cancers.
 

● | TNX-701
--+--------

 We own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701. We have begun preclinical research and development on TNX-701. We plan to develop TNX-701 under the Animal Rule, which is applicable when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The principal components of our strategy are to: 
 

● | Develop TNX-102 SL for FM, PTSD, AAD, AUD and Other Indications. We currently are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of FM and the treatment of PTSD. Our broader development strategy is to leverage the patented formulation to explore the clinical potential of TNX-102 SL in multiple other pain, psychiatric, and addiction conditions, including AAD and AUD, that are either underserved by currently approved medications or have no approved treatment thus representing large unmet medical needs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop TNX-1800 for COVID-19. We currently are focusing on the development of TNX-1800 for protection against COVID-19. We expect to be engaged in laboratory experiments and animal experiments, followed by clinical trials to determine whether TNX-1800 protects against effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection; 


● | Develop TNX-801 for preventing smallpox and monkeypox. We currently are focusing on the development of TNX-801 to protect against smallpox and monkeypox. Based on the results of TNX-801 in an experiment which showed protection of macaques against monkeypox, we are focused on manufacturing TNX-801 vaccine at GMP standard, for further studies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL. We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL, either on our own or through collaboration with partners. We believe TNX-102 SL can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we would build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage. An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas. If we determine that such a strategy would be more favorable than developing our own sales capabilities, we would seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of TNX-102 SL; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates. We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution. In the cases of TNX-801 and TNX-1800, we own patent applications protecting their composition-of-matter and certain methods of its use. In the cases of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties. We plan to opportunistically apply for new patents to protect TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates; 
● | Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates. We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors. In the case of TNX-102 SL, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy. We plan to continue these activities in tandem with our clinical development of TNX-102 SL and to conduct similar work in relation to our other product candidates as they advance in their development; and 
● | Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates. We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates. For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of cyclobenzaprine for generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep. 

Disease and Market Overview
 
Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies or have no approved treatment which represent large potential commercial market opportunities. Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates and lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate is set forth below.

Fibromyalgia
 
FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. The peak incidence of FM occurs between 20-50 years of age, and 80-90% of diagnosed patients are female. FM may have a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in career or education.  According to the American Chronic Pain Association, an estimated six to twelve million adults in the U.S. have FM.
 
According to a report by Frost and Sullivan that we commissioned, despite the availability of approved medications, the majority of patients fail therapy due to either insufficient efficacy, poor tolerability, or both. Prescription pain and sleep medications are frequently prescribed off-label for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic benefit, and many of these medications carry significant safety risks and risk of dependence. For example, approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with FM take chronic opioids, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and the risk of addiction and toxicity, including overdose.
 
COVID-19
 
On December 31, 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus. The novel coronavirus is currently referred to as SARS-CoV-2 and is related to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), although with only approximately 80% similarity at the nucleotide level. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is reportedly highly contagious.
 
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The World Health Organization, or WHO, declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
 
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with SARS-CoV-2. New strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and some appear to have the potential to evade vaccine-induced immunity.
 
Smallpox and Monkeypox
 
Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by the variola virus, or VARV, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus family. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 following a global immunization campaign. Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infective droplets during close contact with infected symptomatic people. Monkeypox is an acute contagious disease caused by the monkeypox virus or MPXV, which is also a member of the orthopoxvirus family. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to those of smallpox, although less severe. Monkeypox is emerging as an important zoonotic infection in humans in Central and West Africa.
 
Smallpox was eradicated by a World Health Organization program that vaccinated individuals with live replicating vaccinia vaccines wherever smallpox appeared. In the 1970s, vaccination of civilians to protect against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security and a proportion of military personnel, including members of the Global Response Force continue to be vaccinated. We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for the U.S. strategic national stockpile and for potential widespread immunization in the event of malicious reintroduction of variola, which is the virus that causes smallpox. Monkeypox is a growing problem in certain regions of Africa. Some cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of Africa in patients who had been infected while in Africa.
 
Currently, there are two FDA approved smallpox vaccines, one of which is also indicated for monkeypox. ACAM2000® (Smallpox [Vaccinia] Vaccine, Live) was approved in 2007 and is indicated for active immunization against smallpox disease in persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. Jynneos® (Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Non-replicating) or MVA-BN is indicated for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection.
 
These two smallpox vaccines are FDA approved and purchased by the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. The U.S. Strategic National Stockpile currently stores more than 300 million doses of smallpox vaccine to protect the U.S. population in the event of reintroduction of variola. We believe that the Strategic National Stockpile will continue to be stocked primarily with a live replicating virus vaccine and secondarily with a non-replicating virus. ACAM2000® is the only replicating vaccinia virus vaccine currently approved by the FDA to protect against smallpox. Jynneos® is the only non-replicating virus vaccine currently approved by the FDA to protect against smallpox. In the post-eradication world, the risk of variola infection is low, so non-replicating vaccines like Jynneos have an appropriate ratio of risk and benefit. However, in a potential post-reintroduction world, we believe live replicating virus vaccines like TNX-801 would be administered to healthy, immunocompetent, non-pregnant adults without risk factors such as eczema or heart disease. The assessment of efficacy of modern smallpox vaccines and the expected benefit of vaccination policy are based on the historical success of predicate live replicating vaccinia vaccines to control smallpox during the time the disease was endemic. We believe TNX-801 has the potential to have improved safety and tolerability relative to replicating vaccinia vaccines and the potential to have improved efficacy relative to non-replicating vaccinia vaccines.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD
 
 PTSD is a chronic condition that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death. The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering traumatic event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Of those who experience a significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD. An estimated 12 million adults annually in the U.S. suffer from PTSD. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians. As of 2012, there were approximately 638,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA. Based on March 2015 VHA data, more than 19% of military veterans involved in recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.
 
Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD and approved medications show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings. Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge. Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and several have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.
 
Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease in which behavioral symptoms are a major clinical complication. Sleep disturbances and agitation are common and co-morbid features of Alzheimer’s disease. Agitation, which includes emotional lability, restlessness, irritability, and aggression, is one of the most distressing and debilitating of these behavioral complications of Alzheimer’s disease. AAD is likely to affect more than half of the 6.2 million Americans who currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is expected to nearly double by 2050. The presence of agitation nearly doubles the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and agitation is estimated to account for more than 12 percent of the $355 billion in healthcare and societal cost of associated with Alzheimer’s disease for the year 2021 in the U.S.
 
Agitation in Alzheimer’s disease is associated with significant negative consequences for both patients as well as their caregivers. Development of agitation, or its worsening, is one of the most common reasons for patients having to transition to nursing homes and other long-term care settings.
 
Currently, there is no treatment approved by the FDA for behavioral symptoms such as agitation and aggression in Alzheimer’s which affect the quality of life of both the patients and caregivers. Off-label use of atypical anti-psychotic medications for behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease is a common practice, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and significant morbidity and mortality risks associated with their use in this population.
 
Alcohol Use Disorder
 
An estimated 36 million adults in the U.S. have AUD.  AUD is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over alcohol intake, and a negative emotional state when not using. Sleep disturbance is extremely common in alcohol recovery and it significantly impacts daytime cognition, mood, and ability to participate in alcohol treatment, and, importantly, is associated with increased risk of relapse. Three drugs have been approved by the FDA, but AUD remains an unmet need due to compliance and safety issues.
Major Depressive Disorder
 
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression affects approximately 16 million adults in the U.S., with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. Depression is a condition characterized by symptoms such as a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities most of the time for two weeks or more, accompanied by appetite changes, sleep disturbances, motor restlessness or retardation, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, poor concentration, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The majority of people who suffer from depression do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy.

Cocaine Intoxication
 
Cocaine is an illegal recreational drug which is taken for its pleasurable effects and associated euphoria. Pharmacologically, cocaine blocks the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine from central nervous system synapses, resulting in the accumulation of dopamine within the synapse and an amplification of dopamine signaling that is related to its role in creating positive feeling. With the continued use of cocaine, however, intense cocaine cravings occur resulting in a high potential for abuse and addiction, or dependence, as well as the risk of cocaine intoxication. Cocaine intoxication refers to the deleterious effects on other parts of the body, especially those involving the cardiovascular system.  Common symptoms of cocaine intoxication include tachyarrhythmias and elevated blood pressure, either of which can be life-threatening.  As a result, individuals with known or suspected cocaine intoxication are sent immediately to the emergency department, preferably by ambulance in case cardiac arrest occurs during transit.  There are approximately 505,000 emergency room visits for cocaine abuse each year in the U.S., of which 61,000 require detoxification services.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, over 15,883 individuals died of cocaine overdose in 2019.
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
 
Previously called hyperkinetic syndrome, ADHD is defined by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Symptoms of ADHD must have been present prior to 12 years of age and must have been present in two or more settings, e.g. at home, school, work; with friends or relatives; in other activities. And there must be clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning. ADHD is a chronic condition that begins in childhood and is one of the most common mental disorders among children. While high activity levels and short attention spans are generally observed in young children, children with ADHD have greater hyperactivity and inattention relative to children their same age. The consequences of ADHD can cause distress for the individual and result in behavioral problems in structured environments such as school, as well as in less structured environments which occur in social settings or in the home. For a majority of these individuals, the diagnosis will carry into adulthood, and symptoms may only partially remit. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that 8.4 percent of children and 2.5 percent of adults have ADHD. 
Migraine Headaches 
 
Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity, although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects. Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur. Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following it. Approximately one billion individuals worldwide suffer from migraine (~14% of the population). Migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability. Chronic migraine (≥ 15 headache/migraine days per month) affects about 1-2% of individuals (~75-150 million individuals worldwide; 3-7 million in the U.S.). CGRP antibodies are the only migraine specific prophylaxis drugs approved in decades, but they require parenteral administration and there are long term safety concerns with prolonged systemic blockade of CGRP receptor.
 
Prader-Willi Syndrome 
 
Prader-Willi syndrome is recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity and affects males and females with equal frequency and all races and ethnicities. The hallmarks of Prader-Willi syndrome are lack of suckling in infants and, in children and adults, severe hyperphagia, an overriding physiological drive to eat, leading to severe obesity and other complications associated with significant mortality. Prader-Willi syndrome is an orphan disease that occurs in approximately one in 15,000 births. There is currently no approved treatment for either the suckling deficit in babies or the obesity and hyperphagia in older children associated with Prader-Willi syndrome.

TNX-102 SL 
 
Overview
 
TNX-102 SL, in clinical development for registration in four indications. TNX-102 SL is a proprietary sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation. We are developing TNX-102 SL as a bedtime treatment for FM, PTSD, AAD and AUD. We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization. Excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved for pharmaceutical use. Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP. 
 
 The current TNX-102 SL sublingual tablets contain 2.8 mg of CBP. For the treatment of FM and PTSD, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (two 2.8 mg tablets) at bedtime is in Phase 3 development. We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in-patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.
 
The active ingredient in TNX-102 SL, is cyclobenzaprine or CBP, a serotonin-2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TNX-102 SL acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for PTSD, including the serotonin-2A, adrenergic alpha-1, muscarinic M1 and histaminergic H1 receptors.
 
CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: Flexeril® (5 mg and 10 mg oral immediate-release, or IR, tablet) and Amrix® (15 mg and 30 mg oral extended-release capsule). The Flexeril brand of CBP IR tablet has been discontinued since May 2013. There are numerous generic versions of CBP IR tablets on the market. CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. CBP IR tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment. Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day CBP IR tablets.
 
We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime and with the intention for long-term use. We believe the selected dose of TNX-102 SL and its unique pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in PTSD and FM. Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral IR CBP tablets. It also showed that the sublingual route of administration, which largely bypasses the “first pass” hepatic metabolism that swallowed medications undergo, results in a higher plasma ratio of CBP to its main active metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine. In clinical studies, TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg were generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious and unexpected adverse reactions reported in these studies. Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration.
 
We have successfully completed the pivotal exposure bridging study with TNX-102 SL compared to Amrix.  Results from this study support the approval of TNX-102 SL under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, with Amrix as the reference listed drug, or RLD. In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) NDA is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the U.S. We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to provide clinical benefit to FM and PTSD patients and possibly other CNS (central nervous system) indications that are underserved by currently marketed products or have no approved treatment.

TNX 102 SL – FM program

We are developing TNX-102 SL as a bedtime treatment for FM under an effective IND application. The potential approval of TNX-102 SL for FM is expected to be under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA.
Clinical Development Plan
 
Ongoing Phase 3 RALLY Study (F306)
 
We are enrolling patients into the Phase 3 RALLY study. We enrolled the first patient in September 2020. The RALLY study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled adaptive design trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TNX-102 SL in FM. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 670 patients across approximately 40 U.S. sites. For the first two weeks of treatment, there will be a run-in period in which patients will start on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg (1 tablet) or placebo. After the first two weeks, all patients will have the dose increased to TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) or two placebo tablets for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is daily diary pain severity score change from baseline to Week 14 (using the weekly averages of the daily numerical rating scale scores), analyzed by mixed model repeated measures with multiple imputation.
 
The RALLY study is expected to have one unblinded interim analysis by an IDMC when the study has results from approximately the first 50% of efficacy-evaluable patients, pending agreement with the FDA. We expect results from the interim analysis in the third quarter of 2021 and topline results from this study in the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming the sample size remains 670 patients. We completed enrollment of 50% of participants in the RALLY study in March 2021.
 

Completed Phase 3 RELIEF Study (F304)
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in 503 participants with FM, which we refer to as the RELIEF study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using TNX-102 SL to treat FM at a dose of 5.6 mg, administered sublingually once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the RELIEF trial was the daily diary pain severity score change from baseline to Week 14 (using the weekly averages of the daily numerical rating scale scores), analyzed by mixed model repeated measures with multiple imputation. The RELIEF study achieved statistical significance on the primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in the weekly average of daily diary pain severity numerical rating scale (NRS) scores for TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (LS mean [SE]: -1.9 [0.12] units) versus placebo (-1.5 [0.12] units), analyzed by mixed model repeated measures with multiple imputation (LS mean [SE] difference: -0.4 [0.16] units, p=0.010). The statistically significant improvement in pain is further substantiated when diary pain was analyzed by another standard statistical approach, a 30 percent responder analysis, with 46.8% on active and 34.9% on placebo having a 30 percent or greater reduction in pain (logistic regression; odds ratio [95% CI]: 1.67 [1.16, 2.40]; p=0.006). Consistent with the proposed mechanism that TNX-102 SL acts in fibromyalgia through improving sleep quality, TNX-102 SL showed nominal improvement of sleep by several measures. For daily diary sleep quality ratings, TNX-102 SL (-2.0 [0.12] units) compared to placebo (-1.5 [0.12] units) was nominally significant (LS mean difference: -0.6 [0.17] units; p<0.001). For the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument, TNX-102 SL was also nominally significant over placebo on T-scores (LS mean difference: -2.9 [0.82] units; p<0.001). The effect sizes on the diary sleep ratings and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument were 0.31 and 0.32, respectively.
 
In the RELIEF study, TNX-102 SL was similarly well tolerated as in Phase 2 BESTFIT and Phase 3 AFFIRM studies which both studied TNX-102 SL at a lower dose of 2.8 mg daily. There were no new safety signals observed in the RELIEF study at the 5.6 mg daily dose. Among participants randomized to the TNX-102 SL and placebo arms, 82.3% and 83.5%, respectively, completed the 14-week dosing period. As expected based on prior TNX-102 SL studies, administration site reactions are the most commonly reported adverse events and were higher in the TNX-102 SL treatment group, including rates of oral numbness (17.3% vs. 0.8%), oral pain/discomfort (11.7% v. 2.0%), taste impairment (6.5% vs. 0.4%), and oral tingling (5.6% v. 0.4%). Oral numbness or tingling and taste impairment were local administration site effects nearly always temporally related to dose administration and transiently expressed (<60 minutes) in almost all occurrences. The only systemic treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred at a rate of 5.0% or greater in either arm was somnolence/sedation at 5.6 percent in the TNX-102 SL arm vs. 1.2% in placebo, which was consistent with known side effects of marketed oral cyclobenzaprine. Adverse events resulted in premature study discontinuation in 8.9% of those who received TNX-102 SL compared with 3.9% of placebo recipients. There were a total of seven serious adverse events in the study, none of which were deemed related to investigational product; five in placebo arm, and two in TNX-102 SL arm. Of the two in the TNX-102 SL arm, one was a motor vehicle accident with multiple bone fractures, and the other was a pneumonia secondary to an infection.

Completed Phase 3 AFFIRM Study (F301)
 
In the third quarter of 2016, we announced the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL in 519 participants with FM, which we refer to as the AFFIRM study. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of using TNX-102 SL to treat FM at a dose of 2.8 mg, administered sublingually once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the AFFIRM trial was the 30% pain responder analysis in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at Week 12 as compared to baseline. AFFIRM did not achieve statistical significance at the primary endpoint (p=0.095). Yet, statistical significance was achieved when pain was analyzed instead as a continuous variable, either by MMRM (p<0.001) or by MMRM with multiple imputation for missing data (p=0.005), a generally accepted approach to pain data. TNX-102 SL also showed statistically significant improvements in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change, or PGIC (p=0.038) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p<0.001). The study also showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, or PROMIS, Sleep Disturbance instrument (p<0.001). We believe that given the consistent results of the analyses of pain as a continuous endpoint, as well as the nominal significance shown on multiple key secondary endpoints, TNX-102-SL 2.8 mg taken daily at bedtime for 12 weeks showed meaningful clinical benefit in this typical FM population. Although, in light of improved results in PTSD with the higher TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg dose, and also better effects on pain in PTSD of 5.6 mg over 2.8 mg, it was predicted that TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg would have a stronger effect on pain in FM. 
 
TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the AFFIRM trial. Among patients randomized to the active and control arms, 78% and 86%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period. The most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 40% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 1% on placebo. These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL. Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo. No serious adverse events were reported.
 
 Regulatory Update
 
In October 2011, we filed the first IND for TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg indicated for the management of FM.
 
In March 2019, we had a Type C Clinical Guidance meeting with the FDA to discuss the clinical development plan for TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg and obtained the FDA’s agreement on the Phase 3 RELIEF study design to support the FM indication.
Other NDA Requirements
 
The Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, was accepted by the FDA in September 2015. An amendment to the Agreed iPSP will be submitted in the second quarter of 2021 for FDA agreement prior to marketing application.
 
Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations, such as geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired patients, drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the TNX-102 SL NDA filing since the pivotal systemic exposure bridging study using Amrix as the reference listed drug, or RLD, has been successfully completed. Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for FM and the long-term safety data in PTSD, up to 15 months, on TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.
 
Phase 1 Bioequivalence, Bridging PK, Food-Effect and Dose-Proportionality Studies
 
Completed Bioequivalence Study
 
We completed a Phase 1 bioequivalence study that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of a single-dose of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: (i) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets for the Phase 2 BESTFIT study; and (ii) the facility used to produce TNX-102 SL 2.8.mg tablets for our clinical studies required to support the FM NDA submission and the to-be-marketed product. This bioequivalence study demonstrated that TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at these two facilities were bioequivalent, supporting the use of the Phase 2 study to support the Phase 3 studies.
Completed Multi-dose Bridging PK Study
 
We intend to seek the FDA’s marketing approval for TNX-102 SL pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA using AMRIX® extended-release, or ER, capsules (30 mg) as our RLD. We completed a study of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in comparison to AMRIX 30 mg ER capsules in a randomized, open-label, parallel, multiple-dose bridging PK study to provide a systemic exposure bridge.  The TNX-102 SL initial dose and at steady state exposures were less than the RLD maximum approved dose (30 mg) and the metabolic profile was similar to AMRIX. The results of this study provide the necessary systemic exposure bridge of TNX-102 SL to AMRIX. The approval of TNX-102 SL for FM can thus rely on the safety findings (clinical and nonclinical) and relevant labeling information in the approved AMRIX prescribing information.
Food Effect and Dose-proportionality Study
 
To support the TNX-102 SL product registration, a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover, food-effect, dose-proportionality, comparative bioavailability study of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg following a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting and fed conditions, and comparing TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg to TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) in healthy subjects under fasting conditions has been completed (TNX-CY-F110). Results from this study confirmed that the rate and extent of absorption of cyclobenzaprine and its long-lived metabolite, norcyclobenzaprine, increased in a dose-proportional manner from 2.8 mg to 5.6 mg of TNX-102 SL. No food effect was observed for cyclobenzaprine or norcyclobenzaprine for TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg.
Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Nonclinical Development
 
The FDA has accepted our proposed nonclinical data package to support our FM NDA filing. In October 2016, we completed the six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of the active ingredient, CBP, in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S., if necessary. These chronic toxicity studies were requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the AMRIX prescribing information, or labeling, which is necessary to support the TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use. Due to the lack of evidence of potential abuse in clinical studies of TNX-102 SL, the FDA agreed that nonclinical study to assess CBP abuse and dependency potential is not required to support the TNX-102 SL NDA filing.
Manufacturing
 
TNX-102 SL drug product for Phase 3 and the associated registration batches for the NDA were manufactured at commercial cGMP facilities. We currently have in excess of 24 months stability data in the proposed packaging configurations ready for commercialization. The FDA has reviewed the proposed CMC data package to support TNX-102 SL’s NDA approval and commercial manufacturing plans as part of the IND process. Tonix is ready to manufacture TNX-102 SL commercial product for the forecasted FM market.
TNX-1800 – Potential COVID-19 Vaccine
 
Overview
 
We are developing TNX-1800 (live modified horsepox virus vaccine for percutaneous administration), a potential vaccine to protect against COVID-19. TNX-1800, which is based on Tonix’s proprietary horsepox vaccine platform, expresses the spike protein from the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19. We believe the platform can be engineered to express relevant protein antigens from different infectious diseases to make a variety of vaccines. On November 16, 2020, we announced that TNX-1800 was well tolerated in non-human primates and vaccination with TNX-1800 resulted in the production of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. As part of our continued collaboration with Southern Research and the University of Alberta, vaccinated non-human primates were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and monitored for disease progression and immunological responses. We expect to report the results of that study in the first quarter of 2021. The further development of TNX-1800 for human clinical trials will require manufacturing according to Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, standards and sufficient animal testing in small animals and in non-human primates.
 
Multiple companies and research institutions are developing potential COVID-19 vaccines. TNX-1800 is in the pre-clinical, pre-Investigational New Drug application, or pre-IND, stage of development and has not been approved for any indication.
 
 We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure of TNX-1800. We recently filed a patent on the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA.

TNX-801 – Potential Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine
 
Overview
 
TNX-801 (live horsepox virus vaccine for percutaneous administration), Investigational Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, consists of a live replicating horsepox virus. The investigational product formulation for nonclinical GLP and clinical studies has not been finalized but is expected to be a sterile liquid for administration by percutaneous scarification. TNX-801 is being developed for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease for immunocompetent, non-pregnant adults at high risk for infection, who lack risk factors such as eczema or heart disease.
 
We are developing TNX-801 as a prophylactic vaccine for active immunization against smallpox and monkeypox disease for individuals at high risk for infection. We believe the efficacy and safety data generated in the course of the proposed studies would facilitate a biologics license application (BLA) for both smallpox and monkeypox vaccine indications.
 
Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by the variola virus, or VARV, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus family. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 following a global immunization campaign. Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infective droplets during close contact with infected symptomatic people. Monkeypox is an acute contagious disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which is also a member of the orthopoxvirus family. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to those of smallpox, although less severe. Monkeypox is emerging as an important zoonotic infection in humans in Central and West Africa. Monkeypox is a growing problem in certain regions of Africa. Some cases of monkeypox have been reported outside of Africa in patients who had been infected while in Africa.
 
Smallpox was eradicated by a World Health Organization program that vaccinated individuals with live replicating vaccinia vaccines wherever smallpox appeared. In the 1970s, vaccination of civilians to protect against smallpox was discontinued in the U.S.; however, smallpox remains a material threat to national security and a proportion of military personnel, including members of the Global Response Force continue to be vaccinated. We are developing TNX-801 as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine for the U.S. strategic national stockpile and for potential widespread immunization in the event of malicious reintroduction of variola, the virus that causes smallpox.
 
Currently, there are two FDA approved smallpox vaccines, one of which is also indicated for monkeypox. Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live (ACAM2000®) was approved in 2007 and is indicated for active immunization against smallpox disease in persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection. In September 2019, the FDA approved J Jynneos® (or MVA-BN), Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Non-replicating. Jynneos® is indicated for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection. Certain potential limitations of ACAM2000 and MVA-BN have prompted Tonix to pursue the development of TNX-801 based on evidence suggesting TNX-801 could provide an alternative to the two approved vaccines. TNX-801 may have advantages for use in healthy, immunocompetent non-pregnant individuals, without a history of eczema or cardiac disease, and as part of a public health vaccination policy to respond to an event of variola reintroduction. The assessment of efficacy of modern smallpox vaccines and the expected benefit of vaccination policy are based on the historical success of predicate live replicating vaccinia vaccines to control smallpox during the time the disease was endemic.
 
The FDA-approved label for ACAM2000 carries a boxed warning related to suspected cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in healthy adult primary vaccinees and other safety concerns. The rate of cardiac adverse events (AEs) was estimated at 5.7 per 1000 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.9-13.3]. The molecular mechanism of ACAM2000 associated cardiotoxicity remains unclear.
 
Since the eradication of smallpox in 1980, the risk and reward ratio of vaccination against smallpox has changed. At the present time, the risks associated with universal ACAM2000 vaccination of the general population outweigh the potential benefits. In addition, ACAM2000 vaccination is not indicated even for first responders. In most of the U.S., routine vaccination against smallpox ended in the early 1970s. In the military, routine vaccinations were limited to recruits entering basic training starting in 1984. In 1990, the Department of Defense (DoD) discontinued routine vaccination of recruits, primarily due to its cardiotoxicity risks. ACAM2000 is currently used primarily in US military personnel deployed to areas that the US government has determined to be at increased risk of malicious smallpox reintroduction and in laboratory workers at potential occupational risk for exposure to orthopoxviruses. According to the Military Health System Smallpox Vaccine Q&A’s, more than 2.6 million service members received a smallpox vaccination between December 2002 and December 2017. Currently, it is believed that approximately 60,000 US military personnel are vaccinated each year, mostly in the global response force. This represents hundreds of potential cases of myocarditis and pericarditis among vaccinated troops. Since the threat of intentional or accidental release of VARV and the reemergence of smallpox has not completely disappeared, we believe efforts to develop safer smallpox vaccines must continue.
 
 In the post-eradication world, the risk of variola infection is low, so non-replicating vaccines like Jynneos have an appropriate ratio of risk and benefit. However, in a potential post-reintroduction world, we believe live replicating virus vaccines like TNX-801 would be administered to healthy, immunocompetent, non-pregnant adults without risk factors such as eczema or heart disease. The assessment of efficacy of modern smallpox vaccines and the expected benefit of vaccination policy are based on the historical success of predicate live replicating vaccinia vaccines to control smallpox during the time the disease was endemic. We believe TNX-801 has the potential to have improved tolerability relative to replicating vaccinia vaccines and the potential to have improved efficacy relative to non-replicating vaccinia vaccines.
 
The FDA approved Jynneos in 2019 based on the demonstration of immunologic non-inferiority to ACAM2000 in humans (peak serum neutralizing antibody titers) and protection against MPXV challenge in a non-human primate (NHP) model. While live replicating vaccinia virus vaccines are administered by a single percutaneous scarification procedure, Jynneos is administered by subcutaneous injection and requires two injections separated by a month or more to induce acceptable neutralizing antibodies.
 
We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the most efficient and appropriate investigational plan to establish the safety and effectiveness evidence to support the licensure of TNX-801. We recently filed a patent on the novel virus vaccine. In addition, 12 years of non-patent-based exclusivity is expected under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. Following the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, we believe TNX-801 qualifies as a medical countermeasure, and therefore should be eligible for a Priority Review Voucher upon receiving FDA licensure. However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023. If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed. We are currently working to develop a vaccine that meets cGMP quality to support an IND study.

TNX-102 SL – Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Program
 
We are developing TNX-102 SL as a bedtime treatment of PTSD under an effective IND application. The potential approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD is expected to be under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. 
Phase 3 RECOVERY Study (P302)
 
We initiated the RECOVERY study (P302) in March 2019. The RECOVERY Phase 3 study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg (2 x 2.8 mg sublingual tablets) over 12 weeks of treatment. The RECOVERY study is being conducted at approximately 30 U.S. sites.  The study planned to enroll 250 participants with civilian and military-related PTSD.  The design of this study was guided based on the results of the Phase 3 HONOR study and Phase 2 AtEase study. RECOVERY restricts enrollment of study participants to individuals with PTSD who experienced an index trauma within nine years of screening. The two previous PTSD studies of TNX-102 SL (P201 and P301) restricted enrollment to participants who experienced traumas during military service since 2001.  The primary efficacy endpoint is the Week 12 mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by CAPS-5 between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo.  Based on interim analysis results of the first 50% of enrolled participants, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the Phase 3 RECOVERY trial (P302) in PTSD for futility as TNX-102 SL was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo. New enrollment for the RECOVERY study was stopped in February 2020, but we continued studying those participants currently enrolled until completion and proceeded with a full analysis of the unblinded data to determine the next steps in this program. Topline data was reported during the fourth quarter of 2020, which revealed that the RECOVERY study did not achieve statistical significance in the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 12 in the CAPS-5 between TNX-102 SL and placebo (p=0.343). TNX-102 SL separated from placebo in the first key secondary endpoint, CGI-S scale (p=0.024) and in the PGIC, (p=0.007). TNX-102 SL also trended for improvement on the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale (p=0.055), consistent with the proposed mechanism of targeting the PTSD sleep disturbance. TNX-102 SL is generally well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed. Tonix plans to meet with the FDA to discuss potential new endpoints for the indication of treatment of PTSD and also to discuss potential endpoints for an indication of PTSD-related Sleep Disturbance. Sleep disturbance is a core symptom of PTSD and believed to play roles in vulnerability, onset, progression and chronicity. Treating sleep disturbance is recognized as a clinically valid approach for addressing global improvement in PTSD.
Discontinued Phase 3 HONOR Study (P301)
 
In the third quarter of 2018, we announced the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of TNX-102 SL, planned for enrollment of approximately 550 participants with military-related PTSD conducted at approximately 40 U.S. sites, which we refer to as the HONOR study. This study was an adaptive design study based on the results of the Phase 2 AtEase study. The study design was very similar to the Phase 2 AtEase study, except there was one planned IA and the involvement of an IDMC, which reviewed the unblinded IA results. In addition, only one active dose (5.6 mg administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) was investigated and the baseline severity entrance criterion was a CAPS-5 total score ≥ 33 in this Phase 3 study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HONOR study was the 12-week mean change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, or CAPS-5, between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo. The CAPS-5 is a standardized structured clinical interview and serves as the standard in research for measuring the symptom severity of PTSD.  The IA was conducted when approximately 50% of the initially planned participant enrollment was evaluable for efficacy. HONOR was discontinued after the results of the IA indicated a pre-defined threshold p-value for continuing enrollment was not achieved, i.e. IDMC recommended stopping for futility.  The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population analyzed at the time of the IA included 252 participants.
 
The HONOR study demonstrated that TNX-102 SL was well tolerated and that the 5.6 mg (administered as 2 x 2.8 mg tablets) dose showed meaningful improvement in overall PTSD symptoms at Week 4. At Week 4, the TNX-102 SL treated group separated from placebo in CAPS-5 (p = 0.019) and in the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) scale (p = 0.015), a key secondary endpoint. A CGI-I responder analysis, with responder defined as ‘much improved’ or ‘very much improved’ on the CGI-I, demonstrated significantly greater responders in the TNX-102 SL group (29.1% v 45.6%; p=0.007) at Week 4.  Also, at Week 4, sleep quality improved as measured by both the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale (p=0.015) and the CAPS-5 sleep disturbance item (p=0.002), supporting the proposed mechanism of action of TNX-102 SL. And the CAPS-5 reckless or self-destructive behavior item at Week 4 was significantly more improved (p=0.013). Safety data from these participants did not reveal any serious and unexpected adverse events. The most common adverse events were mostly related to local administration site reactions, such as oral hypoaesthesia (37.3%), abnormal product taste (11.9%), and oral paraesthesia (9.7%). The most common systemic adverse event was somnolence (15.7%).
 
Retrospective analysis of the HONOR study revealed a treatment effect in participants who experienced trauma less than or equal to nine years prior to screening. In the participants who experienced trauma within nine years, the p-value of the CAPS-5 primary endpoint at Week 12, using mixed model repeated measures with multiple imputation (MMRM with MI), was 0.039, with a least-squares mean difference from placebo of -5.9 units. In contrast, there was no difference in CAPS-5 in the participants who experienced trauma more than nine years prior to screening compared to placebo. This analysis defined an optimal treatment window for treatment with TNX-102 SL for PTSD of the first nine years after the index trauma that resulted in PTSD and guided the design of the next Phase 3 study in PTSD, RECOVERY.

Long-Term Safety Exposure Study for TNX-102 SL
 
In October 2019, we completed long-term safety exposure studies in participants with PTSD to evaluate the tolerability of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg to support an NDA for the treatment of PTSD.  The data provide us with exposure data of daily dosing of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for at least 12 months in more than 50 individuals, and daily dosing of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg for at least 6 months in more than 100 individuals. The data was collected in OLE studies of the PTSD program.  Based on the FDA’s guidance, the long-term safety exposure studies in PTSD are also expected to support an NDA for the management of FM.
 
Regulatory Update
 
In May 2014, we submitted an IND for TNX-102 SL indicated for the treatment of PTSD.
 
In August 2019, we held a Breakthrough Therapy Type B Meeting for continuing BTD with the FDA. FDA agreed to consider the Phase 3 HONOR study additional data and information we presented at the meeting. In May 2020, the FDA rescinded the Breakthrough Therapy Designation for TNX-102 SL because the criteria for designation are no longer met.
 
In February 2020, based on interim analysis results of the first 50% of enrolled participants, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the Phase 3 RECOVERY trial (P302) in PTSD for futility as TNX-102 SL was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall change from baseline in the severity of PTSD symptoms between those treated with TNX-102 SL and those receiving placebo. New enrollment for the RECOVERY study was stopped in February 2020, but continued studying those participants enrolled until completion and then proceeded with a full analysis of the unblinded data in December 2020 to determine the next steps in this program.
 
Other NDA Requirements
 
An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or Agreed iPSP, is required for the initial NDA submission. We submitted a revised iPSP in the first quarter of 2017, which incorporated the FDA comments received on our iPSP submitted in the third quarter of 2016. Additional comments from the FDA were received in second quarter of 2017 on our revised iPSP. We plan to submit an Agreed PSP once a therapeutic dose in adults is established. An acceptable Pediatric Study Plan will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.
 
Based on our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the TNX-102 SL NDA filing since the pivotal systemic exposure bridging study using AMRIX as the reference listed drug, or RLD, has been successfully completed. Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for PTSD and the long-term safety data (up to 15 months) on TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg in a prior FM program, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.

TNX 102 SL – Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Regulatory Update
 
In November 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed development of TNX-102 SL for the treatment of AAD. We received the formal minutes from that meeting in December 2017 that reflect that we have the data needed to file an IND to support a Phase 2 study which can potentially be one of the pivotal efficacy studies. In April 2018, the FDA cleared our IND to support a Phase 2 potential pivotal efficacy study.
 
In July 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for the treatment of AAD.
 
In September 2018, we received the FDA’s comments on our proposed Phase 2 potential pivotal efficacy study protocol. The proposed Phase 2 study can potentially serve as a pivotal efficacy study to support NDA approval.
 
TNX 102 SL – Alcohol Use Disorder
 
Regulatory Update
 
In October 2019, we held a Type B pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed 505(b)(2) development plan for TNX-102 SL as a treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We received the formal minutes from that meeting in November 2019 which provided guidance and feedback supportive of our clinical development plans.
 
Based on this feedback, we submitted an IND application in July 2020 and FDA clearance of an IND application was received in August 2020. This program is now Phase 2 proof-of-concept ready and is expected to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for approval.

Additional Product Candidates
 
We also have a pipeline of other drug and biologic candidates, including, TNX-601 CR, a pre-IND daytime treatment for depression, PTSD, and Neurocognitive Dysfunction from Corticosteroids; TNX-701, a preclinical drug candidate for radioprotection; TNX-1300, a Phase 2 candidate for cocaine intoxication, TNX-1500 a preclinical candidate for transplant organ rejection and autoimmune conditions, TNX-1600, a preclinical candidate for PTSD, ADHD and depression, TNX-1700 a preclinical candidate for cancers of the gastrointestinal system,TNX-1900, a pre-IND candidate for migraine and craniofacial pain as well as insulin resistance disorders, TNX-2900 for Prader-Willi syndrome and TNX-2100, a DTH SARS-CoV-2 skin test for T cell immunity.
TNX-601 CR
 
TNX-601 is a novel oral controlled release, or CR, formulation of tianeptine oxalate and naloxone controlled release tablet, in the pre-IND stage of development for the once-daily treatment for depression and PTSD. Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but tianeptine sodium (amorphous) immediate release tablets have been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America as a three-times-a-day treatment for depression since 1987. Tianeptine sodium is reportedly effective in various depressive states and also improves depression-associated anxiety and somatic complaints. We have discovered a novel oxalate salt and polymorph, which we believe may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine. Like CBP, tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties. Tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the neuroplastic changes that are observed during periods of stress and corticosteroid use. It is a weak mu-opioid receptor agonist, but does not have significant affinity for other known neurotransmitter receptors. Due to its decades of use in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, tianeptine has an established safety profile. In addition to being used to treat depression, several published studies support the potential of tianeptine as an effective and safe therapy for patients with PTSD. Leveraging our development expertise in PTSD, TNX-601 CR is being developed for daytime usage as a first-line monotherapy for depression, PTSD and neurocognitive dysfunction from corticosteroids use. Tianeptine’s reported pro-cognitive and anxiolytic effects as well as its ability to attenuate the neuropathological effects of excessive stress responses suggest that it may be used to treat PTSD by a different mechanism of action than TNX-102 SL.
 
We intend to develop TNX-601 CR under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA as a potential daytime treatment for depression and PTSD. TNX-601 CR will also be developed as a treatment for a potential indication, neurocognitive dysfunction associated with corticosteroid use. Pharmaceutical development work on TNX-601 CR has been initiated. We completed a non-IND formulation selection pharmacokinetic study ex-U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
TNX-701
 
We own rights to intellectual property on a biodefense technology relating to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure, which we refer to as TNX-701. We have begun nonclinical research and development on TNX-701. We plan to develop TNX-701 under the Animal Rule, which is applicable when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.
 
TNX-1900
 
TNX-1900 (Intranasal Potentiated Oxytocin) is in development as a candidate for prophylaxis of chronic migraine and for the treatment of insulin resistance and related conditions. TNX-1900 was acquired from Trigemina in 2020 and licensed from Stanford University in 2020. It has been observed that low oxytocin levels in the body can lead to increase in headache frequency, and that increased oxytocin levels can relieve headaches. Oxytocin, when delivered via the nasal route, results in enhanced binding of oxytocin to receptors on neurons in the trigeminal system, inhibiting transmission of pain signals. Intranasal oxytocin has been well tolerated in several clinical trials in adults and children. Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release in animals, a pathway known to be critical to the pathogenesis of migraine attacks. TNX-1900 is believed to interrupt pain signals at the trigeminal ganglia by suppressing electrical impulses, a potentially different activity than drugs that just block CGRP. Migraine attacks are caused, in part, by the release of CGRP from pain-sensing nerve cells that are part of the trigeminal system. Targeted delivery results in low systemic exposure and lower risk of non-nervous system, off-target effects which could potentially occur with systemic CGRP antagonists. For example, CGRP has roles in dilating blood vessels in response to ischemia, including in the heart. We believe targeted delivery of oxytocin could translate into selective blockade of CGRP release in the trigeminal ganglion and not throughout the body, which could be a potential safety advantage over systemic CGRP inhibition. TNX-1900 is also believed to provide augmented or potentiated analgesia in the treatment of pain, relative to oxytocin.
 
TNX-2900
 
TNX-2900 is based on Tonix’s patented intranasal potentiated oxytocin formulation, or TNX-1900, but being developed for Prader-Willi syndrome. Tonix licensed technology using oxytocin-based therapeutics for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome and non-organic failure to thrive disease from the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm). The licensing agreement has been negotiated and signed by Inserm Transfert, the private subsidiary of Inserm, on behalf of Inserm (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), Aix-Marseille Université and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Toulouse. Prader-Willi syndrome is recognized as the most common genetic cause of life-threatening childhood obesity1 and affects males and females with equal frequency and all races and ethnicities. There is currently no approved treatment for either the suckling deficit in babies or the obesity and hyperphagia in older children associated with Prader-Willi syndrome. Since Prader-Willi syndrome is an orphan disease that occurs in approximately one in 15,000 births, we plan at the appropriate time to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for TNX-2900.

TNX-2100
 
TNX-2100 (SARS-CoV-2 epitope peptide mixtures for intradermal administration) is designed to measure T cell immunity to CoV-2 as a diagnostic skin test. TNX-2100 measures the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. There currently is no standardized laboratory test available to measure T cell immune responses to CoV-2. T cell immunity to CoV-2 persists longer than antibody immunity, is sometimes present in the absence of a measurable antibody response and is believed to provide an important element of protection against serious COVID-19 illness after infection with CoV-2. The proposed skin test has the potential to serve as: 1) a biomarker for cellular immunity and protective immunity; 2) a method to stratify participants in COVID-19 vaccine trials by immune status; 3) an endpoint in COVID-19 vaccine trials, and 4) a biomarker of durability of vaccine protection/ Discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, the DTH reaction has been used for more than a century as a clinical test for T cell-mediated immune reactions1. In the 1940s, Landsteiner and Chase demonstrated that the reaction was mediated by the cellular and not the antibody arm of the immune system2. When small quantities of antigen are injected intradermally, a hallmark response is elicited which includes induration, swelling and monocytic infiltration into the site of the lesion within 24 to 48 hours. This reaction has been shown to be dependent on the presence of memory T cells. Both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown to participate in this response. DTH skin tests have been commonly used to detect T cell responses to tuberculosis, fungal pathogens, and mumps virus. We expect to submit an IND application in the second quarter of 2021and initiate clinical trials in the second half of 2021.
 
Competition
 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level. Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining the FDA’s and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete. Summarized below is the competitive landscape for the indications in which Tonix has product candidates in or nearing the clinical stages of development.
Fibromyalgia 
 
Three drugs have been approved by the FDA for the management of FM: Pfizer’s Lyrica® (pregabalin), Lilly’s Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Allergan’s Savella (milnacipran). Lyrica and Cymbalta have lost patent protection and are available in generic forms. Savella remains on patent.
 
A number of companies are developing prescription medicines for FM, including Aptinyx (NYX-2925), Virios Therapeutics (celecoxib and famciclovir or IMC-1), Teva (Ajovy® or fremanezumab),), Axsome (eseboxetine or AXS-14) and Knop Laboratorios (cannabis sativa extract or KL16-012). NYX-2925 is in Phase 2 for the treatment of FM and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and has been granted a Fast Track Designation by the FDA for DPN. IMC-1 has completed a successful Phase 2a trial and has been granted a Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of FM. Ajovy (fremanezumab) is in the Phase 2. AXS-14 (esreboxetine) was licensed by Axsome from Pfizer and already includes non-clinical and clinical data supporting its use in FM and is currently in Phase 3 development. KL-16-012 is in Phase 2 for the treatment of FM. 
 
PTSD
 
Companies with approved drugs for the treatment of PTSD are GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil® or paroxetine) and Pfizer (Zoloft® or sertraline). Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.
 
Other companies and institutions are known to be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Bionomics (BNC-210), Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti® or brexpiprazole), the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies (methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) and Aptinyx (NYX-783). Bionomics’ BNC-210 completed a Phase 2 for PTSD and Bionomics announced that after reformulation a new Phase 2 will be initiated.  Rexulti is an atypical antipsychotic in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to the SSRI sertraline for treatment of PTSD.. NYX-783 is in Phase 2 for PTSD and is a modulator of the NMDA receptor.  MDMA is in Phase 3 for PTSD and is a DEA schedule 1 hallucinogen that is being studied for drug-assisted psychotherapy. MDMA was granted BTD by the FDA in August 2017 and is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 trial in PTSD. A number of other companies and institutions have or may be developing prescription medications for PTSD, including: Mt. Sinai Hospital and Medical School in New York City is developing ketamine which is in Phase 2 and targets the NMDA receptor, and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is developing losartan which is in Phase 2 and is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), Nobilis Therapeutics is developing NBTX-001, a noble gas, which is in Phase 2b, and Seelos Therapeutics is developing an intranasal racemic ketamine to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD. Several institutions have been assessing the potential of intranasal oxytocin to treat PTSD in Phase 2 trials.

Several companies have clinical candidates for which PTSD is being considered as a secondary indication. Johnson and Johnson is developing CERC-501 or aticaprant which is in Phase 2 for depression, targeting the kappa opioid receptor. Merck is studying Belsomra® (suvorexant) for PTSD, which is already approved for insomnia, NeuroRx is developing NRX-101 which is in Phase 2 for bipolar depression and which comprises a treatment regimen starting with ketamine, and followed by a proprietary combination of lurasidone and d-cycloserine.
 
Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease
 
There are currently no drugs FDA approved for Alzheimer’s disease agitation or AAD. A number of companies are developing prescription medicines for AAD, including Otsuka/Lundbeck (Rexulti® or brexpiprazole), Avanir/Otsuka (AVP-786 or deudextromethorphan/quinidine), Axsome (AXS-05 or dextromethorphan/buproprion) and Intra-Cellular Therapies (Caplyta® or lumateperone or ITI-007). Rexulti® has completed two pivotal studies in AAD. AVP-786 is in Phase 3 for the treatment of AAD. AXS-05 completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for the treatment of resistant depression and completed a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of AAD. Lumateperone is in Phase 3 for treating behavioral disturbances associated with dementia and was recently approved as Caplyta® for the treatment of schizophrenia.
Alcohol Use Disorder 
 
Several medications are beyond their patent life and are generally produced by generic drug companies, including disulfiram (Anabuse®), naltrexone (ReVia®), and acamprosate (Campral®). Alkemes currently markets a branded formulation of naltrexone (Vivitrol®). Adial is developing a reformulation of ondansetron or AD04 using a pharmacogenomic approach and is currently in Phase 3.
Chronic or Episodic Migraine Prophylaxis
 
Currently there are several classes of drugs that are approved for the prophylactic treatment of chronic or episodic migraine, including generic beta blockers (propranolol, timolol), and anticonvulsants (divalproex, topiramate). Other drug classes that are used off-label to treat migraine prophylaxis, include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline). Also, Allergan (acquired by AbbVie) markets Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA). More recently, several companies have introduced to the market CGRP inhibitors including Amgen/Novartis (Aimovig® or erenumab), Teva (Ajovy® or fremanezumab), Eli Lilly (Emgality® or galcanezumab) and Lundbeck (Yvepti® or eptinezumab). Other therapies are approved as abortive treatment for acute migraine.
Cocaine Intoxication
 
There are no approved antidotes for the treatment of cocaine intoxication. Patients generally receive supportive care. Tonix is not aware of any drugs in development for the treatment of cocaine intoxication.
 
Skin Test for COVID-19 (measure of T cell immune response)
 
There currently is no standardized laboratory test available to measure T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, however the FDA recently granted Emergency Use Authorization to T-Detect™ COVID test by Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, which is not standardized. The only other currently available methods to detect T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 require several tubes of blood from the test subject, a multi-step sample preparation process including isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tissue culture with in vitro T cell stimulation in highly specialized laboratories that have fluorescent activated cells sorting (FACS) flow cytometry technology, methodologies that have not been amenable to standardization or scalability for commercial clinical services. Tonix is not aware of other development efforts to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immune responses using an in vivo diagnostic.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-1800, TNX-801, TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use. As of March 9, 2021, the patents we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to include 29 issued U.S. patents and 199 issued non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing an additional 27 U.S. patent applications, of which 9 are provisional and 18 are non-provisional, 5 international patent applications, and 187 non-U.S./non-international patent applications. 
 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 
 Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the PTO in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.  
 
The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA or methods of making or using that drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, is a federal law that encourages new drug research by restoring patent term lost to regulatory delays by permitting a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product or its methods of manufacture or use if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
 
The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our five most advanced product candidates as of March 9, 2021 are summarized below.

We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.

Research and Development
 
We have approximately 17 employees dedicated to research and development. Our research and development operations are located in Chatham, NJ, Dartmouth, MA, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada. We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies.Manufacturing
 
We have contracted with a third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturer organization, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing. For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial. Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.
 
All of our small molecules drug candidates are synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.
 
Our smallpox-preventing vaccine candidate is a biologic and uses live form of horsepox. Both the drug substance (HPVX and the cell bank) and the drug product (vaccine) will be manufactured by contract cGMP-compliant facilities capable of manufacturing for nonclinical/clinical testing and licensed product.
 
On September 28, 2020, we completed the purchase of our 40,000 square foot facility in Massachusetts, to house our new Advanced Development Center for accelerated development and manufacturing of vaccines. As of December 31, 2020, the asset has not been placed in service.
 
On December 23, 2020, we completed the purchase of our approximately 44-acre site in Hamilton, Montana, for the construction of a vaccine development and commercial scale manufacturing facility. As of December 31, 2020, the asset has not been placed in service.
 
On March 5, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a $2.9 million non-binding Purchase and Sale Agreement in connection with a property in Massachusetts. The Property is intended for process development activities.
 
Government Regulations
 
The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements by the FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.
 
The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of drugs in the U.S. under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologic products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of a preapproval inspection by the FDA of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
40

 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator’s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety. Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined.
 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
Clinical testing must satisfy the extensive regulations of the FDA. Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

New Drug Applications
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA (or BLA, in the case of a biologic product). An NDA or BLA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product. An NDA or BLA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.
 
 Section 505(b) NDAs
 
There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates. We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future. A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA’s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs. Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA. The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant’s drug and the reference drug. In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
42

 
Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA. As such, we plan to submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD. The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for FM and PTSD as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. If the FDA determines that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA is not appropriate and that a full NDA is required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved. If the FDA requires a full NDA for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted. If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for a safety reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).
 
Patent Protections
 
An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug. With respect to every patent listed in the FDA’s Orange Book, which is the FDA’s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.
 
If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.
 
 Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.

Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market. The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety. This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period. However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7½ years after the NCE approval date. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria. They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, Section 902 provides for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:
 

● | intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
44

 
Fast Track Designation
 
A Fast Track is a designation by the FDA of an investigational drug which:
 

● | intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | non-clinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The benefits of a Fast Track designation include rolling submission of portions of the NDA for the drug candidate and eligibility for priority review of the NDA. Additionally, more frequent meetings and written communication with the FDA regarding the development plan and trial design for the drug candidate are encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process, with the goal of having earlier drug approval and access for patients.
 
Material Threat Medical Countermeasures
 
In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Act, was signed into law to support ongoing biomedical innovation. One part of the Act, Section 3086, is aimed at “Encouraging Treatments for Agents that Present a National Security Threat.” The Act created a new priority review voucher program for approved “material threat medical countermeasure applications.” The Act defines such countermeasures as drug or biological products, including vaccines intended to treat biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agents that present a national security threat or to treat harm from a condition that may be caused by administering a drug or biological product against such an agent. The Department of Homeland Security has identified 13 such threats, including anthrax, smallpox, Ebola/Marburg, tularemia, botulinum toxin, and pandemic influenza, which includes the SARS coronavirus 2, known as SARS-CoV-2. A priority review voucher can be applied to any other product application; it shortens the FDA review timeline for a new application from 10-12 months to 6 months. The recipient of a priority review voucher may transfer it. We intend to seek a priority review voucher if and when a TNX-801 Biologics License Application is approved as a material threat medical countermeasure. However, the Priority Review Voucher program provision of the 21st Century Cures Act is set to expire in 2023. If TNX-801 does not receive FDA licensure by 2023, we may not be able to capitalize on the incentives contained in the 21st Century Cures Act unless the provision allowing for the Priority Review Voucher Program is extended until such time as TNX-801 is licensed.

 Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including:

● | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


● | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | drug sampling and distribution requirements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 
 
The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

 Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both. The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
47

 
In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
The Impact of New Legislation and Amendments to Existing Laws
 
 The FDCA is subject to routine legislative amendments with a broad range of downstream effects. In addition to new legislation, such as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 or the FDASIA in 2012, Congress introduces amendments to reauthorize drug user fees and address emerging concerns every five years. We cannot predict the impact of these new legislative acts and their implementing regulations on our business. The programs established or to be established under the legislation may have adverse effects upon us, including increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. In addition, the FDA’s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
 
We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 15, 2021, we had 26 full-time employees, of whom nine hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have 17 employees dedicated to research and development. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the skills, experience and industry knowledge of our key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Our research and development operations are located in Chatham, NJ, San Diego, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada. We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies as well as part-time employees.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
