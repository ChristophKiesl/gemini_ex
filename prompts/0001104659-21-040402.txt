ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Timber Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Timber”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of treatments for orphan dermatologic diseases. Our investigational therapies have proven mechanisms-of-action backed by decades of clinical experience and well-established CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and control) and safety profiles. We are initially focused on developing non-systemic treatments for rare dermatologic diseases including congenital ichthyosis, facial angiofibromas (“FAs”) in tuberous sclerosis complex (“TSC”), and scleroderma. Our lead programs are TMB-001, TMB-002 and TMB-003.
 
TMB-001, a proprietary topical formulation of isotretinoin, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of moderate to severe subtypes of congenital ichthyosis (“CI”), a group of rare genetic keratinization disorders that lead to dry, thickened, and scaling skin. A prior Phase 1/2 study involving 19 patients with CI demonstrated safety and preliminary efficacy of TMB-001, as well as minimal systemic absorption. In 2018, the FDA awarded us the first tranche of a $1.5 million grant in the amount of $500,000 to support clinical trials evaluating TMB-001 through its Orphan Products Grant program. In March 2020 and March 2021, the FDA awarded us the second and third tranches of the grant, respectively, each in the amount of $500,000.
 
TMB-002, a proprietary topical formulation of rapamycin, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of FAs in TSC, a multisystem genetic disorder resulting in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organs. TSC results from dysregulation in the mTOR pathway, and as a topical mTOR inhibitor, TMB-002 may address FAs in TSC without the systemic absorption of an oral agent.
 
TMB-003, a proprietary formulation of sitaxsentan, a new chemical entity in the U.S., which is a selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist, is currently in preclinical development as a locally applied formulation for the treatment of scleroderma, a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the skin.
 
In connection with the Merger (as defined below), we acquired the BPX-01 and BPX-04 assets. BPX-01 is a Phase 3 ready topical minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris, and BPX-04 is a Phase 3 ready topical minocycline for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. We will seek to monetize these assets through a license, co-development, or sale.
 
On May 18, 2020, BioPharmX Corporation (“BioPharmX”) completed its business combination with Timber Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Timber Sub”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of January 28, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among BioPharmX, Timber Sub and BITI Merger, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto made and entered into as of March 24, 2020 (the “First Amendment”) and Amendment No. 2 thereto made and entered into as of April 27, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”) (the Merger Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, the “Amended Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Timber Sub, with Timber Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with, and immediately prior to the completion of, the Merger, BioPharmX effected a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a ratio of 1-for-12 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Immediately after completion of the Merger, BioPharmX changed its name to “Timber Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” and the officers and directors of Timber Sub became the officers and directors of the Company.
 
Under the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, BioPharmX issued shares of Common Stock to the holders of common units of Timber Sub. Immediately after the Merger, there were approximately 11,849,031 shares of Common Stock outstanding (after the Reverse Stock Split). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, the former holders of common units of Timber Sub (including the Investors, as defined below, but excluding VARs, as defined below) owned in the aggregate approximately 88.5% of the outstanding Common Stock, with the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to the Merger owning approximately 11.5% of the outstanding Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock issued to the holders of common units of Timber Sub for each common unit of Timber Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was calculated using an exchange ratio of approximately 629.57 shares of Common Stock for each Timber Sub unit. In addition, the 584 Value Appreciation Rights of Timber Sub (“VARs”) that were outstanding immediately prior to Merger became denoted and payable in 367,670 shares of Common Stock at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”). Further, the holder of the 1,819,289 preferred units of Timber Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Merger received 1,819 shares of the newly created convertible Series A preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) at the Effective Time.

In connection with the Merger Agreement, on March 27, 2020, Timber Sub and BioPharmX entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”), with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”) pursuant to which, among other things, we issued to the Investors shares of Timber Sub units immediately prior to the Merger and BioPharmX issued to the Investors warrants to purchase shares of BioPharmX common stock on the tenth trading day following the consummation of the Merger (the “Investor Warrants”) in a private placement transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25 million (which amount is comprised of (x) approximately $5 million credit with respect to the senior secured promissory notes (the “Bridge Notes”) issued in connection with the bridge loan that certain of the Investors at the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement and (y) $20 million in cash from the Investors) (the “Purchase Price”). We issued to the Investors 8,384,764 Series A Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (“Series A Warrants”) and 7,042,175 Series B Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (“Series B Warrants”). At the time of issuance, the Series A Warrants had a 5-year term and an exercise price of $2.7953, subject to the number of shares and exercise price being reset based on our stock price after the Merger. The Series B Warrants had an exercise price per share of $0.001, were exercisable upon issuance and were initially convertible into 7,042,175 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Series B Warrants was also subject to adjustment based on specified reset prices.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, on May 22, 2020 we issued to the Investors warrants to purchase 413,751 shares of Common Stock (the “Bridge Warrants”) which have an exercise price of $2.2362 per share.
 
On November 19, 2020, the Company entered into a Warrant Waiver Agreement with each of the Warrant holders which modified the terms of the original agreement and eliminated further resets. The aggregate number of Series A Warrants issued was fixed at 20,178,214 and the warrant exercise price was fixed at $1.16. The aggregate number of Series B Warrants was fixed at 22,766,777. The exercise price of the Series B Warrants remained unchanged.  
 
In addition, certain restrictions contained in the Warrant Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement were modified including restrictions on the Company’s ability to issue additional equity securities in connection with a financing and the Company’s ability to complete a fundamental transaction. Subject to certain restrictions detailed in the Warrant Waiver Agreement, the Company is now able to complete an equity financing or a fundamental transaction at any time after April 30, 2021.
 
Further, in connection with the Warrant Waiver Agreement the Company agreed to immediately register 11,383,389 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants. The Warrant holders have additional demand registration rights as described in the Warrant Waiver Agreement. As of March 4, 2021, the Series B Warrants were exercised in full. As of March 15, 2021, 16,701,824 shares of common stock remain issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants.
 
We have a limited operating history as the Company was formed on February 26, 2019. Since inception, our operations have focused on establishing its intellectual property portfolio, including acquiring rights to the proprietary formulations of isotretinoin, rapamycin and sitaxsentan, as described above, organizing and staffing the Company, business planning, raising capital, and conducting clinical trials. Since inception, we have financed our operations with $18.9 million through capital contributions
 
Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For the period from February 26, 2019 (inception) to December 31, 2020, our net loss was $18.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $18.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we continue to develop the pipeline of programs.
