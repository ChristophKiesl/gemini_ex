Overview
 Sorrento is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on delivering clinically meaningful therapies to patients and their families, globally. Our primary focus is to transform cancer into a treatable or chronically manageable disease. We also have programs assessing the use of our technologies and products in auto-immune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, infectious diseases and pain indications with high unmet medical needs.
 At our core, we are an antibody-centric company and leverage our proprietary G-MAB™ library to identify, screen and validate fully human antibodies against high impact oncogenic targets and mutations, immune modulators and intracellular targets. To date, we have screened over 100 validated targets and generated a number of fully human antibodies against these targets which are at various stages of preclinical development. These include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2, OX40, TIGIT and CD137 among others.
 Our vision is to leverage these antibodies in conjunction with proprietary targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include proprietary antibody drug conjugates (“ADCs”), bispecific approaches, as well as T-Cell Receptor (“TCR”)-like antibodies.  With LA Cell, Inc. (“LA Cell”), our joint venture with City of Hope, our objective is to become the global leader in the development of antibodies against intracellular targets such as STAT3, mutant KRAS, MYC, p53 and TAU. Additionally, we have acquired and are assessing the regulatory and strategic path forward for our portfolio of late stage biosimilar/biobetter antibodies based on Erbitux®, Remicade®, Xolair®, and Simulect® as these may represent nearer term commercial opportunities.
 With each of our programs, we aim to tailor our therapies to treat specific stages in the evolution of cancer, from elimination, to equilibrium and escape. In addition, our objective is to focus on tumors that are resistant to current treatments and where we can design trials based on a genetic signature or biomarker to ensure patients have the best chance of a durable and significant response.
 We have several immuno-oncology programs that are in or near entering the clinic.  These include cellular therapies, an oncolytic virus, monoclonal antibodies and a palliative care program targeted to treat intractable cancer pain.  
 Our cellular therapy programs focus on Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell (“CAR-T”) for adoptive cellular immunotherapy to treat both solid and liquid tumors.  We have reported early data from Phase I trials of our carcinoembryonic antigen (“CEA”) and PSMA directed CAR-T programs. Our CD38 CAR-T is being evaluated in the context of highly resistant multiple myeloma (“MM”), amyloidosis and graft-versus-host disease (“GvHD”). We are assessing our CD123 CAR-T in the context of highly resistant acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). Both of the latter programs have successfully demonstrated strong preclinical anti-tumor activity in animal models. Our plan is to submit Investigational New Drug (“IND”) applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for at least one of these CAR-T programs in 2017.  
 
1

Finally, as part of our global aim to provide a wide range of therapeutic products to meet underserved therapeutic markets, we have made investments and developed a separate pain focused franchise which we believe will serve to provide short term upside to our core thesis. Within this franchise, resiniferatoxin (“RTX”) is a non-opioid-based TRPV1 agonist neurotoxin used as an injectable pain treatment. The compound RTX has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of intractable pain at end-stage disease. We have conducted a Phase I trial with the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and are exploring a path to accelerated approval with a Phase II, multicenter trial to be initiated in late 2017.  
 
Our Strategy
 Our primary goal is to deliver clinically meaningful therapies to patients and their families, globally. In immuno-oncology, we aim to deliver next generation therapeutics to transform cancer into a treatable or chronically manageable disease. Across all our programs, we are focused on addressing severe unmet medical needs where our therapies can change the natural course of disease or significantly improve a patient’s quality of life.
 Our core strategic objectives and resources are focused on:
  
1. | Advancing our lead product candidates through the clinic. These include the initiation of Phase I, Phase II and potentially accelerated approval trials for our cellular therapies, oncolytic virus immunotherapy and RTX in oncology and/or hematology indications.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Continuing the development of our preclinical programs with the aim of filing several new INDs over the next 5 years. These include moving our checkpoint inhibitors from our core antibody portfolio into the clinic with several of our strategic partners, while internally focusing on advancing our transformational intracellular targeting antibodies (“iTAbs”), with LA Cell.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Collaborating with key opinion leaders and leading clinical and research institutes to enhance our preclinical and clinical development plans. We currently have such agreements in place with the Karolinska Institute, The Scripps Research Institute (“TRSI”), the NIH, City of Hope, Tufts Medical School, and Roger Williams Medical Center, among others.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Manufacturing our preclinical and clinical materials in-house. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Exploring strategic relationships to share in the risk reward of our core franchises and to derive near term value from our non-core franchise, such as our pain franchise. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties as well as profit shares or joint ventures to generate potential returns from our product candidates and technologies.

Pipeline and Product Candidates
 An overview of our core programs is provided in the table below:
 

Near Term Clinical Programs
 Cellular Therapies
 With our cellular therapy subsidiary, TNK Therapeutics, Inc. (“TNK”), we are focusing on the development of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (“CAR”)-based immunotherapies using autologous T-cells.
 T-007: CD38 Directed CAR-T Program
 Our most advanced cellular therapy is T-007, a proprietary, second generation anti-CD38 CAR-T therapy, which we are developing for the treatment of multiple myeloma and for additional potential indications including amyloidosis and graft-versus-host disease. Our anti-CD38 CAR-T is based on a fully human anti-CD38 mAb derived from our G-MABTM antibody library. 
 The membrane glycoprotein CD38 is widely found on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid lineages including B, T and NK cells, but absent from most mature resting lymphocytes with the notable exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells. Because CD38 is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells, it represents a valuable and validated therapeutic target against myeloma. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy in which clonal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow or extramedullary sites and give rise to clinical complications such as painful, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, cytopenias, and symptomatic plasmacytomas. 
 The American Cancer Society estimate 30,280 new cases and 12,590 deaths from multiple myeloma in the U.S. during 2017. The anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody DARZALEX® (daratumumab), marketed by Janssen Oncology, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma on November 16, 2015. Worldwide net sales of DARZALEX® were $572 million in 2016. We are encouraged by the validation of this important target in the market for multiple myeloma therapeutics and its rapid adoption by clinicians in the myeloma community. We believe our CD38 cellular therapy will provide an additional significant advance in the CD38 blockade for multiple myeloma patients that are resistant or have failed current therapies.
 Pre-clinically, T-007 has demonstrated specific activation through the anti-CD38 CAR resulting in the production of cytokines and CAR-T proliferation. In vitro models have shown that CD38-expressing multiple myeloma tumor cells were killed efficiently, and T-007 completely eradicated tumors in a xenograft mouse model of human myeloma. Importantly, T-007 selectively lysed multiple myeloma target cells expressing high levels of CD38 while avoiding the killing of cells with normal or low levels of CD38. We believe this unique characteristic may result in a more tolerable safety profile in humans and enable a more effective manufacturing process of our anti-CD38 CAR-T cells since we do not anticipate to require a genetic CD38 knock-out or knock-down in our construct.
 
3

We believe T-007 benefits from 3 key advantages:
  
1. | Non-Immunogenic: T-007 is based on a fully human mAb generated from our GMAB® library. Fully human mAbs generally do not have the immunogenicity concerns that arise from the mouse antibody sequence found in most current CARs. This may result in a potentially more tolerable CAR-T regimen, and a more durable long term response.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Selective Lysing of High Expressing CD38 Positive Cells: Ability to selectively lyse CD38 high expression cells only, may limit on-target / off-tumor toxicity.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Has Not Demonstrated Graft versus Host Disease: Our anti-CD38 CAR-T cells did not cause GvHD in vivo. This could have implications on our ability to apply this therapy in an allogeneic setting.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our intention is to submit an IND for T-007 in 2017, and initiate a Phase I trial shortly thereafter.
 T-009: CD123 Directed CAR-T Program
 T-009 is a proprietary, second generation anti-CD123 CAR-T therapy which we are developing for the treatment of AML, also known as acute myelogenous leukemia or acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. The American Cancer Society estimates 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths from acute myeloid leukemia in the U.S. during 2017. Our anti-CD123 CAR-T is based on a fully human anti-CD123 mAb derived from our G-MAB™ antibody library. 
 CD123 is overexpressed in a variety of hematological neoplasms, including AML, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”), Hodgkin’s lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia.  The overexpression of CD123 has been clinically correlated with a lower survival rate in AML patients and thus, we believe our T-009 could provide an important therapy in this disease.
 To date, T-009 has demonstrated specific activation resulting in the production of cytokines and CAR-T proliferation. T-009 has selectively lysed CD123-expressing AML tumor cells in vitro, and strongly suppressed the growth of established tumors in a xenograft mouse model of human AML. Upon the completion of our preclinical testing of T-009, we will plan to submit an IND for first in human trials in AML.
 Technologies and Preclinical Pipeline
 G-MAB™: Fully Human Antibody Library Platform
 Our G-MAB™ library, which forms the backbone of many of our product candidates, was initially invented by Henry Ji, Ph.D., our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe our proprietary G-MAB™ library is one of the industry’s largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries, with an estimated one quadrillion unique antibodies available for drug discovery and development. We believe G-MAB™ may offer the following advantages over competing antibody libraries: 

• | G-MAB™ has been designed to provide a full spectrum of human immunoglobulin gene recombination in fully-human mAbs. Unlike chimeric and humanization technologies, G-MAB™ has allowed the generation of antibodies with fully-human protein sequences without the challenges and limitations of animal-to-human gene transfer procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Because G-MAB™ represents an in vitro human mAb library technology, research suggests that it enables faster and cost-effective in vitro screening of a large number of antigens. G-MAB™ is designed so that any antigen of interest can be investigated, with no dependence on the successful induction of a host immune response against the antigen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a depiction of the types of fully human mAbs that we have derived from G-MAB™. It includes antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets, from small molecular weight antigens to large protein complexes antigens, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptors (“GPCRs”), a difficult class of antigens to raise therapeutic antibodies against. 
 

Our objective is to leverage G-MAB™ to develop first in class or best in class antibody drug candidates that will possess greater efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to existing drugs and develop them as novel monotherapies, ADCs (such as c-MET), components of bispecific antibodies, and as part of our adoptive immunotherapy (CD38, CD123) and intracellular targeting programs (STAT3, mutant KRAS). 
 To date, we have screened over 100 validated targets and generated a number of fully human antibodies against these targets which are at various stages of development. These include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2, OX40, TIGIT and CD137 among others. Upon the completion of preclinical studies, our objective is to, independently or in tandem with our strategic collaborators, file INDs for these product candidates. 
 The following diagrams highlight our key antibody-related strategic partnerships and programs:
 


LA Cell: Intracellular Targeting Antibodies (iTAbs)
 With LA Cell, our exclusive joint venture with City of Hope, our objective is to become the global leader in the development of modified antibodies and other macromolecules against intracellular targets. Our internal research suggests that LA Cell’s platform is highly disruptive in that it uniquely enables the penetration of large molecules such as antibodies, peptides and modified DNA into disease cells.  
 
5

We are looking to apply this technology to specifically modulate formerly “undruggable” targets known in the evolution of cancer, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases and viral infections. 
 Antibodies and other protein based therapeutics, compared to other drug modalities, have the advantage of specificity, ease of creation and long-lasting effects in vivo.  Although these therapies have benefited many patients across many solid and hematological malignancies, they are currently constrained in their ability to target solely extracellular proteins, either secreted or membrane bound.  Separately, small molecule drugs are less specific, depend on defined hydrophobic binding pockets and have proven difficult to administer long term given their many off-target toxicities. 
 In contrast, LA Cell’s proprietary technology and iTAbs enable the ability to modulate intracellular targets with modified antibodies derived from our G-MAB™ library. Our lead product candidates focus on key “undruggable” disease targets, such as STAT3, mutant KRAS, MYC and FOXP3 and we have designed constructs which are at various stages of in vitro and in vivo testing. 
 STAT3 iTAb
 Our lead iTAb is targeted against STAT3 and has demonstrated the inhibition of STAT3 through phosphorylation and downstream gene modulation as well as cytotoxic/cytostatic activity in multiple human cancer cells in vitro.  STAT3 is a master regulator of genes controlling cell proliferation, survival, migration and immune suppression which is highly upregulated in human cancers.  Persistent STAT3 activation has been shown to lead to abnormal survival and tumorigenesis with constitutive STAT3 activation reported in 50-90% of human cancers. This prevalence can be attributed to STAT3’s position as the convergence point of several major oncogenic signaling including EGFR, HER2/Neu, platelet-PDGFR, IL-6R/gp130, c-MET, ABL and Src tyrosine kinases. We believe our STAT3 iTAb will be useful in the treatment of severely undertreated cancers such as glioblastoma. STAT3 has emerged as a key initiator and master regulator of mesenchymal transformation in malignant gliomas. We have completed in vitro and pharmacokinetic work and are currently conducting in vivo validation of this iTAb.
 Mutant KRAS iTAb
 Our second most advanced iTAb is targeted against mutant KRAS. 30% of human cancers possess activating RAS mutations, 85% of which are KRAS mutations which are most frequently present in colorectal, pancreatic and lung cancers. In vitro, our KRASG12D iTAb has demonstrated specific cytotoxic activity only in KRASG12D-expressing cancer cells but not in wild-type KRAS cells.
 Biosimilar Antibody Portfolio
 In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Mabtech Limited to develop and commercialize four, late-stage clinical biosimilar or biobetter antibodies based on Erbitux®, Remicade®, Xolair® and Simulect® for the North American, European and Japanese markets. Each of these four antibody programs has completed Phase 3 clinical trials in China. We are assessing the regulatory and strategic path forward for this portfolio due to the fact that, if we are to follow the biosimilar route, we will be required to perform comparative studies versus the reference products in the U.S. and EU.

Pain Franchise 
 Our pain franchise consists of Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Scilex”), a private company which we acquired a majority interest in November 2016, and our subsidiary, Scintilla Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Scintilla”), which houses our RTX program as depicted below:
RTX
 RTX is a small molecule with a non-opiate mechanism of action that may permanently eliminate intractable cancer pain experienced by end-stage cancer patients. When injected intraspinally or paraspinally, RTX directly interacts with nerve cells expressing TRPV1 receptors without affecting normal sensation (touch and vibration sense) or muscle function. RTX has been extensively tested in animals and was tested in an investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial at the NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). To date, 12 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated at the NIH.  
 The mechanism of action for RTX is well understood and has been validated by extensive data in both animals and humans. In chronic pain states, TRPV1 is upregulated and expressed to a greater degree, resulting in central hypersensitivity and pathological pain states. When the drug is delivered via intrathecal injection, through a catheter placed in the cerebrospinal fluid space, it targets and binds to TRPV1 receptors expressed by specific neurons in dorsal root ganglia and the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal column. RTX binding to TRPV1 results in calcium influx, which initiates programmed cell death (apoptosis) of only the targeted neurons and, therefore, results in the permanent reduction of pain transmitted by these TRPV1 positive neurons. 
 We expect to initiate a dose finding study using epidural administration of RTX in 2017.  Given our prior clinical experience with RTX, we expect that the drug will be very well tolerated at all doses and that we will see a dose response.  We have hired a contract manufacturer to produce the current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) drug substance and have sufficient material to complete the clinical development.  We have also secured enough raw materials to cover the commercial needs for several years, including the drug product, also produced by a contract manufacturer, for which we have sufficient vials in storage to complete clinical development. Our plan is to apply for FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and potentially initiate pivotal Phase II trials by the end of 2017.
 Scilex Pharmaceuticals: ZTlido™
 Scilex leverages its core, proprietary technologies to responsibly develop next generation, branded pharmaceutical products to better manage critical conditions and maximize the quality of life of patients and healthcare providers. Scilex’s lead product candidate, ZTlido™ (lidocaine patch 1.8%), is a next-generation lidocaine patch currently in development for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (“PHN”), a severe neuropathic pain condition. ZTlido™ is manufactured by our collaboration partner in their state of the art manufacturing facility.
 The elderly population, individuals that have suffered a shingles infection, HIV/AIDS and cancer patients are at highest risk of contracting PHN. In the 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids in Chronic Pain, topical 
 
7

lidocaine is recommended for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The prescription lidocaine patch market for all indications totaled almost $700 million in 2015 in the U.S. 
 ZTlido™'s anhydrous patch is based on a novel and proprietary technology that contains only 36 mg of lidocaine versus Lidoderm® (lidocaine patch 5%), which holds 700 mg of lidocaine per patch. In December 2016 and January 2017, Scilex reported key endpoints were met in the pivotal bioequivalence clinical trials for ZTlido™. The full data package is expected to be resubmitted to the FDA as part of the 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) in mid-2017 (the initial filing was not accepted by the FDA) and filed with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) in the United Kingdom as part of a hybrid Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) in mid-2017. 
 Recent Developments
 Yuhan Agreement 
 In March 2016, we and Yuhan Corporation, a South Korea company (“Yuhan”), entered into an agreement to form a joint venture company called ImmuneOncia Therapeutics, LLC (“ImmuneOncia”) to develop and commercialize a number of immune checkpoint antibodies against undisclosed targets for both hematological malignancies and solid tumors.  In April 2016, Yuhan purchased $10.0 million of shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), and warrants as part of our private placement offering. Separately, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Yuhan contributed an initial investment of $10.0 million to ImmuneOncia, and we granted ImmuneOncia an exclusive license to one of our immune checkpoint antibodies for specified countries while retaining the rights for the U.S., European and Japanese markets, as well as global rights for ImmuneOncia to two additional antibodies that will be selected by ImmuneOncia from a group of pre-specified antibodies from our immuno-oncology antibody portfolio. Yuhan owns 51% of ImmuneOncia, while we own 49%. 
3SBio Term Sheet
 In June 2016, we and TNK entered into a binding term sheet with Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Company Ltd (“3SBio”), a China based company, to form a joint venture to develop and commercialize proprietary immunotherapies, including those developed from, including or using TNK’s CAR-T technology targeting CEA positive cancers.  Due diligence and negotiations between 3SBio and us for the definitive agreement(s) are currently ongoing.  In June 2016, 3SBio purchased $10.0 million of Common Stock and warrants as part of our private placement offering.
Servier License and Collaboration Agreement
 In July 2016, we announced a license and collaboration agreement with Les Laboratoires Servier, SAS, a corporation incorporated under the laws of France, and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, a company duly organized and existing under the laws of France (individually and collectively, “Servier”) for the development, manufacture and commercialization of products using our fully human immuno-oncology anti-PD-1 mAb STI-A1110. The financial terms of the agreement include, among other things, a non-refundable upfront payment to us of €25 million, or $27.4 million, which we received in July 2016. We may also receive development milestone payments for the initial product and each additional product. We may receive up to €710 million in various payments based on commercial sales milestones related to annual net sales levels for the initial product and then also for each additional product. In addition to the commercial sales milestones, we will be entitled to receive variable royalties on the sales of all commercialized products ranging from high single-digit to double-digit percentages. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $3.8 million in license fee revenue pursuant to the agreement.
 CHA Biotech Term Sheet
 In August 2016, we announced a binding term sheet to create a joint venture (the “JV”) with CHA Biotech Co., LTD. (“CBT”) of South Korea to develop and commercialize proprietary CAR modified cellular therapies based on CBT’s Activated Killer Cell (“AKC”) technology in combination with five of our CARs for all disease conditions, including oncology and infectious diseases. The JV will cover products on a global basis with the exception of the greater Chinese market, which includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In addition, we will obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize CBT’s novel investigator-initiated trial stage AKC technology in major territories, including the United States and Europe, and with a co-exclusive license in China. Under the terms of the Term Sheet, we and CBT will make contributions of $2 million to the JV, and we will grant the JV an exclusive license to five CARs solely for combination with the AKC technology, while CBT will contribute its AKC technology. CBT will initially own 51% of the JV while we will initially hold the remaining 49%. We, under a royalty bearing license, will also gain access to the AKC technology for the use outside the JV alone or with any other of our product candidates. Due diligence and negotiations between CBT and us for the definitive agreement(s) are currently ongoing. However, the binding term sheet is currently terminable by either party at will and no assurances can be made that the transaction will be completed.

(“Celularity”), a research and development company, setting forth the terms and conditions by which we or TNK with one or more third parties would contribute certain assets to Celularity (the “Celularity Transaction”). In addition, at this time, we loaned $5.0 million to Celularity pursuant to a promissory note issued to us (the “Celularity Note”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Celularity Note, the loan will be due and payable in full on the earlier of November 1, 2017 and the occurrence of an event of default under the Celularity Note (the “Maturity Date”). The Celularity Note also provides that, in certain circumstances, we will loan Celularity up to an additional $5.0 million over the next 12 months. In the event that Celularity meets certain minimum financing conditions prior to the Maturity Date, all outstanding amounts under the Celularity Note will be forgiven.
Binding Term Sheet Regarding Acquisition of Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 On August 15, 2016, we, Scintilla and Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Semnur”) entered into a binding term sheet (the “Semnur Binding Term Sheet”) setting forth the terms and conditions by which Scintilla will, through a subsidiary, purchase all of the issued and outstanding equity of Semnur (the “Semnur Acquisition”). The Semnur Binding Term Sheet provides that, contingent upon the execution of a definitive agreement between the parties (the “Definitive Agreement”) and subject to certain conditions, Scintilla will, at the closing of the Semnur Acquisition (the “Semnur Closing”), make an initial payment of $60.0 million (the “Initial Consideration”) to the equityholders of Semnur in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding equity of Semnur. The Initial Consideration will consist of $40.0 million in cash and $20.0 million in shares of our common stock (the “Semnur Stock Consideration”). The Semnur Binding Term Sheet also provides that the number of shares of our common stock comprising the Semnur Stock Consideration will be calculated based on the volume weighted average closing price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the date that is three days prior to the execution of the Definitive Agreement. $6.0 million of the Semnur Stock Consideration will be placed into escrow, a portion of which will be held for a period of up to six or 12 months to secure certain obligations of Semnur and its equityholders in connection with the Semnur Acquisition. At the Semnur Closing, we will enter into a registration rights agreement with certain of Semnur’s equityholders, pursuant to which we will agree to seek the registration for resale of the shares of our common stock comprising the Semnur Stock Consideration.
 In addition to the Initial Consideration, Scintilla may pay additional consideration of up to $140.0 million to Semnur’s equityholders upon Scintilla’s completion of certain clinical studies and trials, receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the achievement of certain sales targets following the Semnur Closing.
 Under the Semnur Binding Term Sheet, either party may terminate the Semnur Binding Term Sheet.
 As of December 31, 2016, the Semnur Acquisition had not closed. The final terms of the Semnur Acquisition are subject to the negotiation and finalization of the Definitive Agreement and any other agreements relating to the Semnur Acquisition, and the material terms of the Semnur Acquisition are expected to differ from those set forth in the Semnur Binding Term Sheet. In addition, the Semnur Closing will be subject to various customary and other closing conditions.
 A member of our board of directors is Semnur’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of Semnur’s Board of Directors and currently owns approximately 5.5% of Semnur’s total outstanding capital stock. Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC provided an opinion to our board of directors opining that the consideration to be paid by Scintilla in the Semnur Acquisition is fair, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders.
 Binding Term Sheet Regarding Acquisition of Virttu Biologics Limited

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Certain factors can either extend patent term or provide other forms of exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity) for varying periods depending on the date of patent filing, date of grant or the legal term of a patent in the various jurisdictions in which patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, also depends upon the type of patent, the scope of claim coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the particular country.
 While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in any intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and, if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
 In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
U.S. Government Regulations 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, import and export of materials and products, environmental protection and the use and handling of hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemical compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 
  
• | Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are also Phase III trials but may be Phase II trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 
 
12

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
 The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 
 After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, 
 
13

including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Available Special Regulatory Procedures 
 Formal Meetings 
 We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the U.S., there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 
 The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting. 
 Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials and pharmaco-vigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from health authorities in the U.S. and the European Union, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to an SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical trials begin, or if the trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition 
 
14

affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.  
 In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union 
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 
  
• | Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (European Union) 
 Based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative 
 
15

therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
 There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Law”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law established: 
  
• | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 
16

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. 
 Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 
 Antibody Clinical Development 
 We currently focus our research efforts primarily in the identification and isolation of human antibody drug candidates and further characterize these antibody candidates in in vitro and in vivo functional testing. Due to our limited financial resources, we intend to actively seek product development and commercialization partners from the biopharmaceuticals industry to help us advance the clinical development of select product candidates. 
Marketing and Sales
 We currently do not have any commercial manufacturing or sales capabilities. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses, which are equipped to manufacture, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed manufacturing capabilities, marketing and sales teams and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
 We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMPs. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 154 employees and 21 consultants and advisors. A significant number of our management and our other employees and consultants have worked or consulted with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future. 
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses, excluding acquired in-process research and development expenses, totaled $42.2 million and $31.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 Corporate Information 
 On September 21, 2009, QuikByte Software, Inc., a Colorado corporation and shell company (“QuikByte”), consummated its acquisition of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation and private concern (“STI”), in a reverse merger (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of STI common stock were converted into an aggregate of 6,775,032 shares of QuikByte common stock and STI became a wholly owned subsidiary of QuikByte. The holders of QuikByte’s common stock immediately prior to the Merger held an aggregate of 2,228,333 shares of QuikByte’s common stock immediately following the Merger. 
 We were originally incorporated as San Diego Antibody Company in California in 2006 and were renamed “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.” and reincorporated in Delaware in 2009, prior to the Merger. QuikByte was originally incorporated in Colorado in 1989. Following the Merger, on December 4, 2009, QuikByte reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). Immediately following the Reincorporation, on December 4, 2009, we merged with and into QuikByte, the separate corporate existence of STI ceased and QuikByte continued as the surviving corporation (the “Roll-Up Merger”). Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed in connection with the Roll-Up Merger, QuikByte’s name was changed from “QuikByte Software, Inc.” to “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.”
