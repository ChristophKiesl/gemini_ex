Item 1. Business
Overview
Zuora provides a cloud-based subscription management platform, architected specifically for dynamic, recurring business models. Our solution enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage and scale a subscription business, automating the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing, collections and revenue recognition. With Zuora’s solution, businesses can change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, analyze customer data to optimize their subscription offerings, and build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.
Many of today’s enterprise software systems manage their order-to-revenue processes using software built for a product driven economy. These systems were not designed for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services and can be extremely difficult to configure. In traditional product-based businesses, order-to-revenue was a linear process—a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue is recognized. These legacy product-based systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships, commonly found in a subscription business, and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Using product-based software to build a subscription business often results in inefficient processes with prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, and a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs).
However, new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and analyze data to drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate. That’s where Zuora comes in.
Our vision is “The World Subscribed” -- the idea that one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy. Our focus has been on developing software that enables our customers to thrive as a subscription business. 
Our solution includes Zuora Central Platform, Zuora Billing, Zuora Revenue, Zuora Collect, and other software that support and expand upon these core products. Our software helps companies analyze data - including information such as which customers are delivering the most recurring revenue, or which segments are showing the highest churn, enabling customers to make informed decisions for their subscription business and quickly implement changes such as launching new services, updating pricing (usage, time, or outcome based), delivering new offerings, or making other changes to their customers’ subscription experience. We also have a large subscription ecosystem of global partners and the Subscribed Strategy Group, that can assist our customers with additional strategies and services throughout the subscription journey.
Companies in a variety of industries - technology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, telecommunications, and many others - are using our solution to scale and adapt to a world that is increasingly choosing subscription-based offerings. Our customers include over 25 of the Fortune 100 and 8 of the top 10 auto manufacturers.
Business Benefits of Using Our Solution
Zuora’s products enable companies to:
•Enable New Recurring Revenue. Zuora helps companies to transform their existing product-centric business models into subscription services to take advantage of the predictability and resilience of recurring revenue.
•Reduce Time to Market. Zuora significantly reduces the time required to go-to-market with new subscription offerings and to iterate on the pricing and packaging of existing offerings, enabling businesses to quickly react to changing market and customer needs, launch new services, and enter new markets. Changes can be made in minutes without having to re-code or re-engineer back office systems.
•Increase Operational Efficiencies. Customers regularly make changes to their subscriptions. Zuora automates these processes and reduces the impact of changes, including proration for invoices, changes to 
revenue recognition, taxation, provisioning, and reporting. Automating these functions saves businesses valuable time and resources by eliminating manual processes and customizations and increasing operational efficiencies.
•Free Up IT and Engineering Resources. Our cloud-based solution reduces both system complexity and costs. With Zuora, engineering and IT departments no longer need to build in-house custom systems or customizations for their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to keep up with market changes, ongoing customer demands, and new order-to-cash processes.
•Establish a Single System of Record. Our solution captures financial and operational data and enables subscription businesses to have a single system of record rather than having to reconcile data from multiple systems. Key business metrics can be accessed at any point in time to make critical business decisions.
•Make Customer Data-Driven Decisions. Because our solution serves as a single source of data and information for subscribers, companies can use Zuora to gain insight into customer behavior. This helps them understand their subscribers better, predict up-sell opportunities, and increase customer retention.
•Access Growing Ecosystem of Order-to-Revenue Software Partners. Our solution has over 50 pre-built connectors to various order-to-revenue software partners, including payment gateways, tax vendors, general ledgers, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Rather than building integrations for each of these, our customers can take advantage of pre-built connectors to extend the capabilities of Zuora for specific industries.
•Support Rapid International Expansion. With over 35 pre-built payment gateways, over 150 supported currencies, and over 15 supported payment methods, our solution enables companies to quickly expand internationally and acquire and support customers in new geographical regions. 
•Automate Revenue Recognition. In light of the accounting complexities associated with subscription models, our revenue recognition product automates revenue recognition processes in compliance with accounting standards and reduces our customers’ reliance on error-prone manual processing and spreadsheets.
Products
Our solution is the system of record for our customers’ subscription businesses. We can deploy and configure our portfolio of products to meet a wide variety of use cases for subscription business models. 
We offer four flagship products:
•Zuora Central Platform. Our Zuora Central Platform acts as an orchestration engine for all subscription data and processes, allowing customers to power their order-to-revenue operations and customer experiences for subscription business models. Our Zuora Central Platform provides the following capabilities:
◦Integrated data model enabling customers to manage their subscribers and easily set up and iterate products, subscribers, subscriptions, rate plans, payment methods and other data necessary to orchestrate the subscriber experiences. 
◦Enterprise-grade capabilities for security, compliance, and tenant management as well as capabilities to integrate to any relevant enterprise application such as configure-price-quote (CPQ), e-commerce, customer portal, and general ledger. 
◦Develop tools that enable customers and system integrators to customize and extend the functionality of the platform, including workflow, custom objects, data queries, and test environments.
◦Analytics and reporting to provide customers insights from their subscriber data and related activity across the subscriber lifecycle, including out-of-the-box subscription metrics such as monthly recurring revenue (MRR), annual contract value (ACV), and customer churn.
•Zuora Billing. Designed specifically for subscription billing, Zuora Billing allows our customers to deploy and tailor a variety of pricing and packaging models to support their subscription business, to efficiently and accurately bill customers, to calculate prorations when subscriptions change, and to group customers into batches for different billing and payment operations. The product also helps our customers set payment terms, manage hierarchical billing relationships, consolidate invoicing across multiple subscriptions, and collect revenue using a global network of payment gateways. Zuora Billing also includes our Zuora CPQ module, which enables customers to configure, price, and quote a wide variety of subscription transactions, including complex arrangements such as multi-year subscriptions, and price ramps. The Zuora CPQ module also uses a rules engine and guided selling workflows to help customers scale their sales teams.
•Zuora Revenue. Zuora Revenue is a revenue recognition automation solution that enables our customers to group transactions of goods and services into revenue contracts and performance obligations in accordance with recent revenue standards including ASC 606 and IFRS 15. Zuora Revenue helps our customers automate revenue and deferred revenue management in accordance with their accounting policies, business rules, and pricing models, including support for complex scenarios around Standalone Selling Price (SSP) analysis for determining the fair value of the individual goods and services sold and Cost Management Accounting and Amortization for all costs incurred as part of obtaining or fulfilling a contract with a customer.
•Zuora Collect. Specifically designed to handle the complicated function of collections associated with dynamic subscription-based businesses, Zuora Collect helps our customers streamline and optimize their collections processes with a particular emphasis around electronic payments collections. Zuora Collect enables customers to configure their own automated dunning workflows, orchestrating various retry rules for electronic payments, and targeting the root cause of a payment decline. We recently announced the addition of machine learning capabilities to the automated dunning capabilities of Zuora Collect to improve overall electronic payments success rates and reduce involuntary churn.

Our Customers
Organizations of all sizes, across a wide variety of industries and in many locations around the world, have adopted our solution. As of January 31, 2021, we had 676 customers with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000, representing over 90% of our total ACV. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 624 and 526 customers, respectively, with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. For more information on ACV, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operational and Financial Metrics.”
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. Our key focus areas are companies that are adopting, transforming, and expanding their subscription businesses.
We have an enterprise sales model supported by a field sales organization. Because of the transformative nature of our solution, especially in larger organizations, the selling process is often complex and can involve agreement across multiple departments inside an organization, including the chief executive officer. Over the years, we have developed methodologies and best practices to assist our sales teams in navigating these challenges and have built these learnings into our sales enablement and training to assist with onboarding and productivity of new sales account executives. We believe our sales methodologies and processes offer us significant advantages, particularly in long enterprise sales-cycles. Our sales teams are organized by geographic territories, customer size, and customer verticals. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our enterprise customer base, both domestically and internationally.
We conduct a wide range of account-based marketing activities such as virtual webinars and online events; partner marketing with our system integrators, consultants, and ecosystem partners; the Subscription Economy Index, our study of the collective health of subscription businesses and their impact on the overall economy; and as educational content, data-based benchmarks and best practices sharing for the Subscription Economy in a variety of formats such as digital, print, and video on Zuora.com and Subscribed.com.
In fiscal 2021, we announced the Subscribed Strategy Group (SSG), which works directly with individual companies and helps them apply expertise attained from the Subscribed Institute’s research to their specific business needs. The SSG works one-on-one with executives from our customer organizations to chart a strategic path towards subscription success by identifying and removing business obstacles, building internal alignment, and establishing routes to success. Best practices developed from our work with over a thousand subscription companies around the world help our customers make critical business decisions, adopt new strategies, and measure their success at regular intervals.
As newer markets emerge domestically and internationally, we plan to continue investing in our sales and marketing to grow our customer base.
Competition
The market for subscription management products and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. 
Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
•providers of traditional ERP software, such as Oracle Corporation and SAP SE;
•providers of CRM applications such as Salesforce; 
•traditional order-to-revenue solutions that address individual elements of the subscription revenue process, such as traditional CPQ management, billing, collections, revenue recognition, or e-commerce software;
•niche billing systems for telecommunications, such as Amdocs Limited;
•payment platforms that offer built-in recurring billing functionality;
•smaller subscription billing providers; and
•in-house custom built systems.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•subscription-based product features and functionality;
•ability to support the specific needs of companies with subscription business models;
•ease of use;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•enterprise-grade performance and features such as system scalability, security, performance, and resiliency;
•customer experience, including support and professional services;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•relationships with system integrators, management consulting firms, and resellers;
•ability to integrate with legacy and other enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•total cost of the solution.
We believe we compete favorably against our competitors with respect to these factors. Our ability to compete will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
Human Capital
Our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity Officer together are responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes our approach to attracting, hiring, onboarding, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and inclusive employee base. Our culture is rooted in the premise that our employees, whom we call “ZEOs”, are CEOs of their careers. Our ZEO culture values freedom, responsibility and accountability for ZEOs to chart their own path in achieving Zuora's mission of enabling customer success. As of January 31, 2021, we had a total of 1,190 employees, of whom 499 were located outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Asia and Australia.
Employee Culture and Community Involvement
Our culture is a critical component of our success. Our ZEOs are the lifeblood of our company and we strive to create an environment where they feel empowered and inspired to contribute to our mission to power the Subscription Economy. Our culture focuses on fostering a collaborative, fun, high performance and inclusive environment where ZEOs can achieve individual and team objectives and key results. We provide opportunities for our ZEOs to grow in both formal and informal learning environments, as well as create a strong emphasis on internal mobility growth opportunities. 
We encourage our ZEOs to give back to the causes that matter to them. In 2017, Zuora became a member of the Pledge 1% movement and we are committed to leveraging our employees' time and talent to make the communities where we live and work stronger. To facilitate our Pledge 1% initiative, we have empowered our employees with the tools and resources they need to create local Z-Philanthropy chapters at our offices worldwide. Through our Z-Philanthropy chapters, ZEOs in our offices across the globe step up to lead giving and volunteering efforts throughout the year and create lasting partnerships with local nonprofits through these employee-led groups. In addition to the sustained efforts of our local Z-Philanthropy chapters, we host an annual Global Week of Giving where ZEOs worldwide participate in volunteer and fundraising events.
In 2019, we also launched Zuora.org, which is a part of our company and not a separate legal entity. To date, we have issued 121,267 shares of our Class A common stock to the Zuora Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund managed by the Tides Foundation, and we expect to contribute additional shares in the future. This fund issues grants to organizations committed to providing workforce development and supporting inclusive economies. During fiscal 2021, we made contributions to over 50 different funds or organizations under the Zuora Impact Fund, including to the Australian Red Cross Society, the United Nations Foundation, Rise Against Hunger, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and Black Lives Matter Global Network Project. In addition to supporting our global ZEOs passions around volunteering, we support the work of our ZEOs in their communities through grantmaking and ZEOs can apply for grants up to $5,000 to support nonprofit organizations. Additionally, our Zuora Impact Fund Committee, composed of a group of ZEOs from across the world, helps Zuora in its donation determinations.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are key to our success. We seek and embrace employees who bring diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences to our ZEO culture. Our commitment to developing a diverse and thriving workforce and inclusive ZEO culture begins at the top, with our Founder and CEO Tien Tzuo, and the entire executive team. Our executive management team is currently composed of 36% women, and 27% who self-identify as coming from certain underrepresented groups. In addition, our Board of Directors is made up of highly skilled individuals from the technology and business sectors. Women represent 25% of our Board of Directors and 37% of our Board of Directors identify as members of certain underrepresented groups. 
In fiscal 2021, we created a standalone Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) department, led by our recently hired Chief Diversity Officer, to help us increase our diversity by weaving inclusion into all aspects of how we work with each other, build and deliver products and experiences to customers, and contribute to our local communities. Our ZEO employee resource groups (ERGs) play a key role in this effort. Our ERGs are ZEO-founded and led groups and open to all ZEOs. Current D&I-focused ERGs, which are aimed at elevating the experiences and interests of key underrepresented groups in our workforce, include Out at Zuora, supporting LGBTQ+ ZEOs and allies; Zuora Familia, supporting our Hispanic and Latinx ZEOs; Zuora Black Network, supporting our Black ZEOs around the world; and Z-Women, our largest ERG, supporting women ZEOs. 
While our ERGs are a critical component of increasing belonging and inclusion among ZEOs, increasing education is equally critical for strengthening inclusive processes and behaviors in our workforce. At the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our first global unconscious bias training module and plan to build on that foundation in fiscal 2022.
Employee Development and Training
We believe that investing in the growth and development of our ZEOs will directly enhance our overall company performance. As owners of their careers, ZEOs are encouraged to invest regularly in their own professional development. In support of this, we offer mentorship programs, leadership programs, and other Z-Grow employee trainings, which are designed to help ZEOs develop and manage their careers, drive accountability, and promote a culture of continuous feedback. Additionally, through our Career Cash program, we offer ZEOs a stipend to pursue external courses and learning opportunities to enhance their professional development.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
We strive to provide pay, comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our ZEOs. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, including equity compensation, paid time off, and other comprehensive and competitive global benefits. For example, in the United States, we provide 26 weeks of paid parental leave for new parents who have been employed with us for at least six months. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align ZEO interests with our stockholders' interests, we offer equity compensation under our broad-based stock incentive programs. We also offer the opportunity for eligible ZEOs in the United States and certain international locations to participate in our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).
Intellectual Property
We primarily rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2021, in the United States, we held 13 issued patents that expire between 2033 and 2039, and had 18 patent applications pending. We also held one issued patent in Australia that expires in 2032 (absent any extensions), and had nine patent applications pending in other foreign jurisdictions. We also pursue the registration of our domain 
names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2021, we had 17 registered trademarks in the United States, including Zuora, Subscription Economy, Subscribed, and Powering the Subscription Economy. We also had 17 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties in connection with the disclosure of our confidential information.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Backlog
We generally enter into subscription agreements with our customers with one- to three-year terms. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. We typically invoice customers in advance in either annual or quarterly installments. Due to this, at any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered by us to be backlog.
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewal, changes in customer financial circumstances, and foreign currency fluctuations. Moreover, customers may attempt to renegotiate the terms of their agreements to, among other things, change their committed volume during the term of the subscription agreements. Our customers also often make other alterations to their subscription agreements during the term of the agreement, including changing their platform edition or the products they subscribe to. All of these changes during the term of a customer’s subscription agreement may significantly impact the firm backlog as of any particular date. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
