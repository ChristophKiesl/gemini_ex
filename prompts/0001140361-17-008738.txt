The Company believes that its ability to reformulate its products and the general availability of alternate sources of materials would enable it to maintain its competitive position in the event of an interruption in the supply of raw materials from a single supplier.
Competition
 
All Company products are sold in highly competitive markets.  While no single factor is determinative, the Company’s competitive position is based principally on process and applications expertise, quality, technological advances resulting from its research and development, and customer service and support.  Because of its highly differentiated products, the Company competes with only a few companies across multiple product lines, and is more likely to encounter competition specific to a particular product line.

· | Flavors & Fragrances. Competition to supply the flavors and fragrances industries has taken on an increasingly global nature. Most of the Company’s customers do not buy their entire flavor and/or fragrance products from a single supplier and the Company does not compete with a single supplier in all product categories. Competition for the supply of flavors and fragrances is based on the development of customized ingredients for new and reformulated customer products, as well as on quality, customer service and price. Competition to supply dehydrated vegetable products is present through several large and small domestic competitors, as well as competitors in other countries. Competition for the supply of dehydrated vegetables is based principally on product quality, customer service and price.

Competition in the supply of cosmetic colors and ingredients, specialty inks and pharmaceutical excipients is based on the development of customized products and solutions as well as quality, customer service and price. The Company believes that its reputation and capacity as a color producer as well as its product development give it a competitive advantage in these markets.
