Our success in acquiring, integrating and expanding into new promotional EHR/eRx platforms continues to grow as well.
 
Pharmaceutical Sales and Marketing Updates
 
Our sales team continues to expand opportunities within existing clients and close opportunities with new clients. We are focused on adding additional brands for existing clients, expanding the utilization of our network for existing brands, and obtaining new clients.
 
Additionally, we are expanding our service offerings as follows:
 

● | Brand Messaging – we have successfully integrated our new platform with 2 partners and are currently testing. We expect revenue in the second half of 2017. Additionally, we expect our exclusive partnership with Allscripts that allows us to offer LogRx brand messaging to accelerate revenue growth in this area. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brand Support/New Drug File Integration – we have designed a service to better insure that manufacturers’ brands are available in every ePrescribing platform available and we have incorporated this to an overall program related to launch brands that includes brand awareness messaging and financial messaging. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are also continuing to ramp up our marketing efforts as follows:
 

● | Held multiple meetings, including some initiated and arranged by pharmaceutical companies, to bring on new Health Systems/ePrescribe Platforms. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sponsored the 4th Annual ePrescribe/EHR Pharmaceutical Conference. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With the growth of both the number of our pharmaceutical brands and our distribution network, we expect that our distribution of financial messages will continue to increase substantially in 2017.
 
Operational Update
 
In 2017, in addition to expanding our existing network, we plan to intensively focus on increasing physician utilization of our partner networks. We continue to work individually with each of our partners based on their particular situation to improve workflow to increase coupon utilization by those providers that have access, obtain access for those prescribers that currently do not have financial messaging access, and increase overall revenue derived from each channel. We believe there is significant revenue growth available within our existing brands by better utilizing our existing partner networks, in addition to the revenue growth provided by new brands and new network partners.
 
We signed an agreement in 2015 with Allscripts to become their exclusive provider of financial messaging and to obtain access to their Touchworks EHR product, which is used primarily by large health systems. We expect financial messaging activity to commence within Touchworks in the first quarter of 2017 and to continue to ramp up throughout the year. We expect this launch to have a significant impact on our revenue growth.
 
Technology Updates
 
To support our growth, we have migrated our platform to Oracle database software. Our system can manage up to 1 million rules and return the appropriate content within 1 second. This allows unsurpassed response time to avoid delays, and gives us the ability to meet the upcoming accelerated revenue growth that we expect.
 
We have developed our own proprietary brand messaging system that will expand our ability to deliver key clinical messages in addition to financial support and plan to integrate this within EHRs that currently do not offer this valued product to their providers. We are currently testing this system with our first partner and expect to launch this messaging system in the first half of 2017 and then expand to other channels as well.
 
Summary
 
Despite the lengthy sales cycle involved in creating this new financial messaging market, we remain very excited about our core financial messaging business and expect to significantly accelerate revenue growth in 2017 with the launch of additional channels, brands and products. We expect our active network to grow substantially in 2017.
Principal Products and Applications
 
Our principal products and applications can be summarized as follows:
 

● | Financial Messaging – Our integrated financial messaging platform is a revolutionary virtual "Patient Support Center" that allows doctors and staff to access a universe of sample vouchers, co-pay coupons and other patient support through their EMR and/or e-Prescribe systems to search, print or electronically dispense directly to patients and a national network of pharmacies. Our platform eliminates the need for physicians to manage and store physical drug samples by offering a more convenient and efficient way to allocate, administer and track samples and co-pay savings provided to their patients. Today, almost 60% of doctors’ offices ban or limit drug representatives and the samples they offer. Although samples are still valuable, many healthcare systems and doctors are looking for an easier, more effective way to increase affordable access and adherence to their prescribed branded medications.

● | Brand Messaging – Our brand messaging services include a variety of brand awareness and clinical messaging services that can be tailored to meet the needs of a brand. These messages can include brand awareness messages, reminder ads, clinical messages, and unbranded messages that can be targeted by specialty, diagnostic code, and other criteria. Brand messaging is highly complementary to our core financial messaging product. Historically, we have sold brand messaging based on specific products offered by our EHR partners, but we have developed our own proprietary brand messaging system and expect to roll that product out in 2017. We have also purchased all available 2017 inventory from Allscripts for its LogRx brand messaging product. We believe brand messaging represents a significant growth opportunity for us.

● | Brand Support – Our brand support is focused on educating and working with pharmaceutical manufacturers on identifying, formulating, and implementing new eRx media strategies for promoting their products. Our services include: 1) Drug File Integration - a service designed to better insure that manufacturers’ drugs are present in every ePrescribing platform available; 2) Sales Force Training – a service to educate the extended field sales force on this new integrated solution and what to look for within their client base to insure maximum exposure of their brands; and 3) Strategy Development – a service that assists manufactures in identifying and building a competitive strategy to take advantage of this new digital frontier. Currently, this activity results in less than 10% of our revenue, but represents a significant growth opportunity for us.

Marketing and Sales
 
We continue to extend our marketing efforts to build both brand and capabilities awareness in the market. As previously discussed, we continue to actively participate in industry and partner events such as exlPharma and the ACE – Allscripts Users Conference, as well as having taken a lead sponsor position in the CBInet eRx and EHR conferences in March of 2016. We are also the named sponsor of the March 2017 conference. During the course of the year, we also initiated and delivered successful email marketing campaigns, which generated viable leads for our sales force.
 
In 2016, we completed an update of our corporate branding including updating our website and marketing materials.
 
We also continue to focus on the expansion of our strategic partnership with WPP/Grey Health Group, a leading agency within the healthcare marketplace, which included a significant investment by an affiliated entity of WPP in 2015. We plan to continue to increase our marketing efforts with all of our strategic partners, as we intend to continue to promote our platform primarily through the following:
 

● | Industry and Partner Events; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Email Campaigns; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
Our platform competes in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and healthcare digital marketing industry that is dominated by large well-known companies with established names, solid market niches, wide arrays of product offerings and marketing networks. Our financial messaging offerings compete for pharmaceutical budgets with a variety of other forms of advertising and promotion.

Despite these overall competitors, we do not have major competition in our specific portion of the financial messaging market. We have been experiencing a growing list of potential partners whom either have content that they want to deliver through our distribution engine and network, or whom have complementary technology and want to integrate our solution as a channel partner, expanding our reach to clinicians. The primary direct competitors in our space of the market are ConnectiveRx and Aptus Health. However, we believe our breadth of brands offered, extensive list of pharmaceutical clients, and the vast reach of our network give us a substantial advantage and allow us to achieve a dominant position in the marketplace.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In 2012, we were awarded a patent for our innovative solution (US Patent No. 8,341,015). This award was a result of our extensive research and development efforts. The awarded claims cover our ability to electronically process, display and distribute eligible prescription savings on the medications and therapies healthcare providers wish to prescribe for their patients.
 
We use a nationally ranked intellectual property law firm to further expand and protect our intellectual property. Through them, we have filed two additional patents on our technology. We believe our current and expanding IP will allow us to continue being the leader in this rapidly growing space. We stand ready to prepare additional filings, as necessary, to protect our intellectual property on any forthcoming solutions that will further assist and support physicians, pharmacists and patients.

Government Regulation
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes
 
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. The law contains a few statutory exceptions, including payments to bona fide employees, certain discounts and certain payments to group purchasing organizations. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for its products. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the Federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or OIG, issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, beginning in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law, and that do not fall within a safe harbor, are analyzed by the OIG on a case-by-case basis. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of healthcare companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities with personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. Settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and/or penalties and in some instances criminal pleas. In addition to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payors, including commercial health insurance companies.

False Claims Laws
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused submission of false claims. The Federal Civil False Claims Act also includes whistle blower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry related to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
Privacy and Security
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the rules promulgated there under require certain entities, referred to as covered entities, to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their business associates, as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the business associates to safeguard the covered entity's PHI against improper use and disclosure. While not directly regulated by HIPAA, our customers or distributors might face significant contractual liability pursuant to such an agreement if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. It is possible that HIPPA compliance could become a substantial regulatory burden and expense to our operations, although we do not believe that this will occur as a general website publisher.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 19 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, in addition to contracted programmers, as needed, through our established relationship with Simple eSolutions, a technical and programming resources partner.
Subsidiaries
 
We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OptimizeRx Corporation, a Michigan corporation.
