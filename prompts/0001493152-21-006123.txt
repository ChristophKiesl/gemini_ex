Viewbix Inc. (f/k/a Virtual Crypto Technologies, Inc., f/k/a Emerald Medical Applications Corp.)

Viewbix Business Overview
 
Viewbix is an interactive video technology and data platform that provides its client with deep insights into their video marketing performance as well as the effectiveness of its messaging. Viewbix allow companies to add a layer with interactive content on top of a video that allows viewers to engage and interact with the video. The platform measures exactly when a view takes an action while watching a video and collects and reports the results to the client.
 
Viewbix developed the interactive video platform based on Software as a Service (“SaaS”) business model with interactive elements, and the ability to collect and analyze information about each interactive action performed during the viewing of the video clip. The interactive elements and information gathered allows the client to analyze user viewing habits and optimize real-time throughout the campaign while increasing the effectiveness of online and live video marketing.
 
Viewbix has adapted its technology platform to work on most nonproprietary platforms on the Internet, including, but not limited to, online video campaigns, brand and image videos, online tutorials, live and real-time video streaming (e.g. music concerts and sporting events), video presentations, and more. Using the Viewbix platform, video creators can integrate advances features into their videos, specifically the inclusion of “click” buttons that trigger a particular action, into a given video, like the insertion of a smart form for retrieving the contact information of the viewer. Viewbix then collects all the data around the cross section of the viewing data and engagement data and offers its clients the opportunity to download and analyze the results. Viewbix also offers a full service option where the Viewbix account managers will analyze the data and report results and suggestions to its clients.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company initiated certain cost reduction measures during fiscal year-ended December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2020, each of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer tendered their resignations from their respective positions. Moreover, due to the Company’s failure to meet predetermined sales targets set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company determined to reduce the size of its sales team and, likewise, the R&D team was replaced with a more cost-effective consultant. These decisions, and future decisions related to cost-reduction measures, may impact the Company’s ability to sell and support its products in the future and, accordingly, may materially impact the Company’s business operations.
 
Industry Overview
 
Video marketing remains one of the fastest growing industries, and, accordingly is increasingly crowded with competition. According to a study published by Cisco, by 2022 online videos will represent 82% of online consumer traffic. Globally, three trillion minutes (or five million years) of video content will cross the Internet each month by 2022, which is the equivalent of 1.1 million minutes of video streamed or downloaded every second.
Competition
 
While there are many companies that offer hosting and streaming services, Viewbix focuses on providing expanded value to its clients that reaches beyond the hosting and streaming platforms. Viewbix has several direct competitors, including Hapyak, which operates primarily via websites, and Innovid, which focuses on advertisements. Additionally, video hosting companies, such as Wistia and Vidyard, both offer certain interactive elements similar to Viewbix. However, Viewbix’s proprietary component is its focus on interactivity and deep data, which results can thereafter be analyzed and applied.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
Our commercial success depends, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection, in the United States and internationally, for the technologies used in our products. We cannot be sure that any of our patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. The patent positions can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions.
 
We have four patents that have been granted to us in the U.S. which we consider material to our business and operating success, including the following:
 

● | U.S. Patent No. 10,467,684: the granted patent relates to novel techniques implemented by Viewbix which enables businesses to configure their video players to incorporate interactivity functions, such as call-to-actions, into their video publishing and delivery workflows;

● | U.S. Patent No. 9,792,645: the granted patent provides a unique method to facilitate video interactions between a publisher and end users, and measures the data produced through that interaction. 

 
We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. However, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Product Development
 
Viewbix has been focusing its R&D efforts on the expansion of its interactive live capabilities also collecting the engagement data for each session and relating back to a live stream. This would greatly enhance our client’s feedback on its stream for both real time and future stream optimizations.
