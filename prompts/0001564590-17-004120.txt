ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 Ryerson Holding Corporation (“Ryerson Holding”), a Delaware corporation, is the parent company of Joseph T. Ryerson & Son, Inc. (“JT Ryerson”), a Delaware corporation. On December 17, 2014, Ryerson Inc., formerly a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, merged with and into JT Ryerson, which was previously an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, with JT Ryerson as the surviving corporation. As a result of such merger, from and after December 17, 2014, JT Ryerson has been a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding. Affiliates of Platinum Equity, LLC (“Platinum”) own approximately 21,037,500 shares of our common stock, which is approximately 57% of our issued and outstanding common stock. 
 We are a metals service center, with operations in the United States through JT Ryerson, in Canada through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Ryerson Canada”) and in Mexico through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Ryerson Metals de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (“Ryerson Mexico”). In addition to our North American operations, we conduct materials distribution operations in China through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Ryerson China Limited (“Ryerson China”). Unless the context indicates otherwise, Ryerson Holding, JT Ryerson, Ryerson Canada, Ryerson China, and Ryerson Mexico together with their subsidiaries, are collectively referred to herein as “Ryerson,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company.” 
 Our Company 
 We believe we are one of the largest value-add processors and distributors of industrial metals in North America measured in terms of sales. Our industry is highly fragmented with the largest companies accounting for only a small percentage of total market share. Our customer base ranges from local, independently owned fabricators and machine shops to large, international original equipment manufacturers. We carry a full line of over 65,000 products in stainless steel, aluminum, carbon steel and alloy steels and a limited line of nickel and red metals in various shapes and forms. More than 75% of the products we sell are processed to meet customer requirements. Specifically, we provide a wide range of flat and long metals products, we offer numerous value-added processing and fabrication services such as sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length, leveling, flame cutting, laser cutting, edge trimming, edge rolling, roll forming, tube manufacturing, polishing, shearing, forming, stamping, punching, rolling shell plate to radius and beveling to process materials to a specified thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased 1.9 million tons of materials from suppliers throughout the world. Our value proposition also includes providing a superior level of customer service and responsiveness, technical services and inventory management solutions. Our range of products together with our breadth of services allows us to create long-term partnerships with our customers and enhances our profitability.
 We track the processing operations, if any, performed on sold material for over 95% of our total revenues. The activities we track broadly fall into four main processing categories: (1) sheet processing (excludes fabrication activities), (2) as-is long and plate, (3) cut long and plate, and (4) fabrication.  A key metric that we track is the percentage mix of revenue that comes from our fabrication capabilities. In 2010, the mix of revenue from fabrication activities was 6.7% of our sales, while in 2016, our mix of revenue from fabrication activities rose to 9.2% of our sales largely due to the strategic investments we have made in value-added processing capital expenditures.
 We operate over 90 facilities across North America and five facilities in China. Our service centers are strategically located in close proximity to our customers, which allows us to quickly process and deliver our products and services, often within the next day of receiving an order. We own, lease or contract a fleet of tractors and trailers, allowing us to efficiently meet our customers’ delivery demands. In addition, our scale enables us to maintain low operating costs. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 15.3% and 14.5%, respectively. 
 We serve approximately 40,000 customers across a wide range of manufacturing end markets. Our geographic network and broad range of products and services allow us to serve large, international manufacturing companies across multiple locations. We believe the diverse end markets we serve reduce the volatility of our business in the aggregate.
 Industry Overview 
 Metals service centers serve as key intermediaries between metal producers and end users of metal products. Metal producers offer commodity products and typically sell metals in the form of standard-sized coils, sheets, plates, structurals, bars and tubes. Producers, mostly steel and aluminum mills, prefer large order quantities, longer lead times and limited inventory in order to maximize capacity utilization across their typically higher capital-intensive structure. 
 4


End users of metal products seek to purchase metals with customized specifications, including value-added processing. End-users in highly diverse industries such as machinery, construction and transportation often look for “one-stop” suppliers that can offer processing services along with lower order volumes, shorter lead times, and more reliable delivery. 
 As an intermediary, metals service centers aggregate end-users’ demand, purchase metal in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale and then process and sell metal that meets specific customer requirements. 
 The metals service center industry is comprised of many companies, the majority of which have limited product lines and inventories, with customers located in a specific geographic area. In general, competition is based on quality, service, price and geographic proximity. 
 The metals service center industry typically experiences cash flow trends that are counter-cyclical to the revenue and volume growth of the industry. Companies in the industry primarily have working capital assets. During an industry downturn, companies generally reduce working capital assets and generate cash as inventory and accounts receivable balances decline. As a result, operating cash flow and liquidity tend to increase during a downturn, which typically facilitates industry participants’ ability to cover fixed costs and repay outstanding debt. 
 We compete with many other metals service centers and to a lesser extent with primary metal producers. Primary metal producers typically sell to larger customers that require regular shipments of higher volumes of steel than the traditional service center customer. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Leading Market Position in North America 
 We believe we are one of the largest service center companies for carbon and stainless steel as well as aluminum based on sales in the North American market where we have a broad geographic presence with over 90 facilities. 
 Our service centers are located near our customer locations, enabling us to provide timely delivery to customers across numerous geographic markets. Additionally, our widespread network of locations in the United States, Canada and Mexico helps us to utilize our expertise to more efficiently serve customers with complex supply chain requirements across multiple manufacturing locations. We believe this is a key differentiator for customers who need a supplier that can reliably and consistently support them. Our ability to transfer inventory among our facilities better enables us to more timely and profitably source and process specialized items at regional locations throughout our network than if we were required to maintain inventory of all products and specialized equipment at each location. 
 We believe with our significant footprint in the North American market, combined with our significant scale and operating leverage, a cyclical recovery of the service center industry supported by long-term growth trends in our end markets should allow us to experience higher growth rates relative to North American economic improvement. However, there can be no guarantee that we will experience such higher growth rates. 
 Broad Geographic Reach across Attractive End Markets. 
 Our operations serve a diverse range of industries, including commercial ground transportation manufacturing, metal fabrication and machine shops, industrial machinery and equipment manufacturing, consumer durable production, HVAC manufacturing, construction equipment manufacturing, food processing and agricultural equipment manufacturing and oil and gas. We believe these industries will provide demand for our products and services as the North American manufacturing economy continues to grow. In addition, we expect to benefit from continued growth in international markets that will help spur demand at domestic manufacturing facilities that sell into the global market. We believe that our ability to quickly adjust our offering based on regional and industry specific trends creates stability while also providing the opportunity to access specific growth markets. 
Established Platform for Organic and Acquisition Growth. 
 Although there can be no guarantee of growth, we believe a number of our strategies, such as investing in value added processing capabilities, analytically targeting attractive customers and end markets with our supply chain optimization service model, expanding our large network of service centers both through capital expenditures and acquisitions, and pricing our products and services based on the value we deliver to our customers will provide us with growth opportunities. 
 5


Given the highly fragmented nature of the service center industry, we believe there are numerous additional opportunities to acquire businesses and incorporate them into our existing infrastructure. Given our large scale and geographic reach, we believe we can add value to these businesses in a number of ways, including providing greater purchasing power, improving expense and working capital management, access to additional end markets and broadening product mix. 
 Lean Operating Structure Providing Operating Leverage. 
 From historical significant changes to our footprint and decentralized operational management through tactical productivity and spending improvements, Ryerson has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage expenses. Even on volumes which were slightly higher than 2015, our warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $14 million, or 3.2%.  In an improving metals service center environment characterized by increases in demand and/or pricing, we believe that most additional expenses to service higher revenue and margins would come from variable expenses while further leveraging economies of scale on our existing fixed expenses.
 We have also focused on process improvements in inventory management. Average inventory days excluding LIFO decreased from 80 days in 2015 to 76 days in 2016.  Our average inventory days have improved on an overall basis from 100 days in 2006. This reduction has decreased our exposure to metals price movements as well as increased capacity in our facilities to devote to higher margin products and capabilities. These organizational and operating changes have improved our operating structure, working capital management and efficiency. 
 As a result of our initiatives, we have increased our financial flexibility and believe we have a favorable cost structure compared to many of our peers. This achievement will provide significant operating leverage if revenue improves. 
 Extensive Breadth of Products and Services for Diverse Customer Base. 
 We believe our broad product mix and marketing approach provides customers with a “one-stop shop” solution few other service center companies are able to offer. We provide a broad range of processing and fabrication services to meet the needs of our approximately 40,000 customers and typically fulfill more than 1,000,000 orders per year. We also provide supply chain solutions, including just-in-time delivery, and value-added components to many original equipment manufacturers. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales, and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 12% of our sales. 
 Strong Relationships with Suppliers. 
 We are among the largest purchasers of metals in North America and have long-term relationships with many of our North American suppliers. We believe we are frequently one of the largest customers of our suppliers and that concentrating our orders among a core group of suppliers is an effective method for obtaining favorable pricing and service. We believe we have the opportunity to further leverage this strength through continued focus on price and volume using an analytics-driven approach to procurement. In addition, we view our strategic suppliers as supply chain partners. Our coordinated effort focused on logistics, lead times, rolling schedules, and scrap return programs ultimately results in value-based buying that is advantageous for us. Metals producers worldwide are consolidating, and large, geographically diversified customers, such as Ryerson, are desirable partners for these larger suppliers. Our relationships with suppliers often provide us with access to metals when supply is constrained. Through our knowledge of the global metals marketplace and capabilities of specific mills we believe we have developed a global purchasing strategy that allows us to secure favorable prices across our product lines. 
Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Knowledge. 
 Our senior management team has extensive industry and operational experience and has been instrumental in optimizing and implementing our strategy in the last four years. Our senior management has an average of more than 20 years of experience in the metals or service center industries. Our CEO, Mr. Edward Lehner, who joined the Company in August 2012 as CFO and became CEO in June 2015, has nearly 30 years of experience, predominantly in the metals industry. Mr. Erich Schnaufer, who joined the Company in 2005 and became CFO in January 2016, has over 25 years of financial and accounting experience and over 10 years with Ryerson. Under their leadership, we have increased our focus on positioning the Company for growth and enhanced profitability.

Industry Outlook 
 We believe that the United States economy has grown since the recession that began in 2008. According to the Institute for Supply Management, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (“PMI”) was above 50% for 29 of the last 36 months, which indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy was generally expanding over the last three years. The PMI measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector and is a composite index based on five indicators: new orders, inventory levels, production, supplier deliveries and the employment environment. PMI readings can be a good indicator of industrial activity and general economic growth. That being said, another indicator of manufacturing activity, the US Federal Reserve’s Industrial Production Index, has shown monthly year-over-year contraction in dollars spent from September 2015 through November 2016.
 Additionally, the overall U.S. economy is projected to continue growing as evidenced by the Federal Reserve’s midrange forecasted real GDP growth rates of 2.1%, 2.0%, and 1.9% for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. 
 Steel demand in North America is largely dependent on growth of the automotive, industrial equipment, consumer appliance and construction end markets. One of our key end markets is within the industrial equipment sector and according to the latest Livingston Survey, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.9% in 2016 and is expected to grow by 1.5% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2017. 
 China continues to be a key driver in the growth of global metals demand. According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s GDP grew 6.7% in 2016 and is projected to grow 6.5% in 2017 and 6.0% in 2018. 
 Products and Services 
 We carry a full line of carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steels and aluminum, and a limited line of nickel and red metals. These materials are inventoried in a number of shapes, including coils, sheets, rounds, hexagons, square and flat bars, plates, structurals and tubing. 
 The following table shows our percentage of sales by major product lines for 2016, 2015 and 2014: 
 
 
Product Line | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
----------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Carbon Steel Flat | | 28 | % | | 25 | % | 25 | %
Carbon Steel Plate | | 9 | | | 11 | | 12 | 
Carbon Steel Long | | 13 | | | 16 | | 15 | 
Stainless Steel Flat | | 17 | | | 16 | | 16 | 
Stainless Steel Plate | | 4 | | | 4 | | 4 | 
Stainless Steel Long | | 3 | | | 3 | | 4 | 
Aluminum Flat | | 16 | | | 16 | | 15 | 
Aluminum Plate | | 3 | | | 3 | | 3 | 
Aluminum Long | | 5 | | | 4 | | 4 | 
Other | | 2 | | | 2 | | 2 | 
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 More than 75% of the materials sold by us are processed. We use processing and fabricating techniques such as sawing, slitting, blanking, cutting to length, leveling, flame cutting, laser cutting, edge trimming, edge rolling, polishing and shearing to process materials to specified thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality pursuant to specific customer orders. Among the most common processing techniques used by us are slitting, which involves cutting coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil, and leveling, which involves flattening metals and cutting them to exact lengths. We also use third-party fabricators to outsource certain processes that we are not able to perform internally (such as pickling, painting, forming and drilling) to enhance our value-added services. 
 The plate burning and fabrication processes are particularly important to us. These processes require sophisticated and expensive processing equipment. As a result, rather than making investments in such equipment, manufacturers have increasingly outsourced these processes to metals service centers. 
 As part of securing customer orders, we also provide services to our customers to assure cost effective material application while maintaining or improving the customers’ product quality. Our services include: just-in-time inventory programs, production of kits containing multiple products for ease of assembly by the customer, consignment arrangements and the placement of our employees at a customer’s site for inventory management and production and technical assistance. We also provide special stocking programs in which products that would not otherwise be stocked by us are held in inventory to meet certain customers’ needs. These 
 7


services are designed to reduce customers’ costs by minimizing their investment in inventory and improving their production efficiency. 
 Additional financial information is presented in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 Customers 
 Our customer base is diverse, numbering approximately 40,000 and includes most metal-consuming industries, most of which are cyclical. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales, and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 12% of our sales. Substantially all of our sales are attributable to our U.S. operations and substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. The following table shows the Company’s percentage of sales by metal consuming industry for 2016, 2015 and 2014: 

 | Percentage of Sales | 
-------------------------------------------+---------------------+----
Metal Consuming Industry | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
Commercial ground transportation | | 16 | % | | 18 | % | 17 | %
Metal fabrication and machine shops | | 18 | | | 18 | | 18 | 
Industrial machinery and equipment | | 18 | | | 17 | | 18 | 
Consumer durable | | 11 | | | 10 | | 11 | 
HVAC | | 7 | | | 8 | | 7 | 
Construction equipment | | 9 | | | 8 | | 7 | 
Food processing and agricultural equipment | | 9 | | | 7 | | 7 | 
Oil & gas | | 5 | | | 7 | | 9 | 
Other | | 7 | | | 7 | | 6 | 
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Some of our largest customers have procurement programs with us, typically ranging from three months to one year in duration. Pricing for these contracts is generally based on a pricing formula rather than a fixed price for the program duration. However, certain customer contracts are at fixed prices; in order to minimize our financial exposure, we generally match these fixed-price sales programs with fixed-price supply programs. In general, sales to customers are priced at the time of sale based on prevailing market prices.
 Suppliers 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top 25 suppliers accounted for approximately 76% of our purchase dollars. We purchase the majority of our inventories at prevailing market prices from key suppliers with which we have established relationships to obtain improvements in price, quality, delivery and service. We are generally able to meet our materials requirements because we use many suppliers, because there is a substantial overlap of product offerings from these suppliers, and because there are a number of other suppliers able to provide identical or similar products. Because of the competitive nature of the business, when metal prices increase due to product demand, mill surcharges, supplier consolidation or other factors that in turn lead to supply constraints or longer mill lead times, we may not be able to pass our increased material costs fully to customers. In recent years, there have been significant consolidations among suppliers of carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Continued consolidation among suppliers could lead to disruptions in our ability to meet our material requirements as the sources of our products become more concentrated from fewer producers. We believe we will be able to meet our material requirements and believe we will continue to be among the largest customers of our suppliers. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We maintain our own sales force. In addition to our office sales staff, we market and sell our products through the use of our field sales force that we believe has extensive product and customer knowledge and through a comprehensive catalog of our products. Our office and field sales staffs, which together consist of approximately 650 employees, include technical and metallurgical personnel. 
 A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Our sales, as measured in terms of tonnage, in the months of July, November and December traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Consequently, our sales in the first two quarters of the year are usually higher than in the third and fourth quarters.

Capital Expenditures 
 In recent years we have made capital expenditures to maintain, improve and expand processing capabilities. Additions by us to property, plant and equipment, together with retirements for the five years ended December 31, 2016, excluding the initial purchase price of acquisitions and the initial effect of fully consolidating a joint venture, are set forth below. The net capital change during such period aggregated to an increase of $76.0 million. 

 | Additions | | Retirements or Sales | | | Net
-----+---------------+------+----------------------+---+------+----
 | (In millions) | 
2016 | $ | 23.0 | | $ | 5.0 | | $ | 18.0
2015 | | 22.3 | | | 9.1 | | | 13.2
2014 | | 21.6 | | | 6.3 | | | 15.3
2013 | | 20.2 | | | 13.5 | | | 6.7 
2012 | | 40.8 | | | 18.0 | | | 22.8

 
We currently anticipate capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, of up to approximately $25 million for 2017. We expect capital expenditures will be funded from cash generated by operations and available borrowings. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,000 persons in North America and 325 persons in China. Our North American workforce was comprised of approximately 1,400 office employees and approximately 1,600 plant employees. Twenty-five percent of our plant employees were members of various unions, including the United Steel Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
 Three renewal contracts covering approximately 63 employees were successfully negotiated in 2016. Six contracts covering 118 employees are currently scheduled to expire in 2017.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
 Our facilities and operations are subject to many foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive requirements relating to waste disposal, recycling, air and water emissions, the handling of regulated materials, remediation, underground storage tanks, asbestos-containing building materials, workplace exposure and other matters. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all such laws and do not presently anticipate substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future in order to meet environmental, workplace health or safety requirements or to pay for any investigations, corrective action or claims. Claims, enforcement actions, or investigations regarding personal injury, property damage, or violation of environmental laws could result in substantial costs to us, divert our management’s attention and result in significant liabilities, fines, or the suspension or interruption of our facilities. 
 We continue to analyze and implement safeguards to mitigate any environmental, health and safety risks we may face. As a result, additional costs and liabilities may be incurred to comply with future requirements or to address newly discovered conditions, which costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For example, there is increasing likelihood that additional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will occur at the foreign, federal, state and local level, which could affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. While the costs of compliance could be significant, given the uncertain outcome and timing of future action by the U.S. federal government and states on this issue, we cannot accurately predict the financial impact of future greenhouse gas regulations on our operations or our customers at this time. We do not currently anticipate any new programs disproportionately impacting us compared to our competitors. 
 Some of the properties currently or previously owned or leased by us are located in industrial areas or have a long history of heavy industrial use. We may incur environmental liabilities with respect to these properties in the future including cost of investigations, corrective action, claims for natural resource damages, claims by third parties relating to property damages or claims relating to contamination at sites where we have sent waste for treatment or disposal. Based on currently available information we do not expect any investigation or remediation matters or claims related to properties presently or formerly owned or operated or to which we have sent waste for treatment or disposal would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2011, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) named us as one of more than 100 businesses that may be a potentially responsible party for the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (the “PHS Site”). On January 6, 2017, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (“ROD”) regarding the site. The ROD includes a combination of dredging, capping and enhanced natural recovery that would take approximately thirteen years to construct plus additional time for monitored natural recovery, at an estimated present value cost of $1.05 billion. The EPA has not yet allocated responsibility for the contamination among the potentially responsible parties, including us. We do not currently have sufficient information available to us to determine whether the ROD will be executed as currently stated, whether and to what extent we may be held responsible for any of the identified contamination, and how much (if any) of the final plan’s costs might ultimately be allocated to us. Therefore, management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter or estimate a range of potential loss at this time.
Excluding any potential additional remediation costs resulting from any corrective action for the properties described above, we expect spending for pollution control projects to remain at historical levels below $500,000 per year. 
 Our United States operations are also subject to the Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. We operate a private trucking motor fleet for making deliveries to some of our customers. Our drivers do not carry any material quantities of hazardous materials. Our foreign operations are subject to similar regulations. Future regulations could increase maintenance, replacement, and fuel costs for our fleet. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We own several U.S. and foreign trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Certain of the trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, in certain circumstances, with the trademark offices of various foreign countries. We consider certain other information owned by us to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding such matters and implementing measures to restrict access to sensitive data and computer software source code on a need-to-know basis. We believe that these safeguards adequately protect our proprietary rights and vigorously defend these rights. While we consider all of our intellectual property rights as a whole to be important, we do not consider any single right to be essential to our operations as a whole.
Foreign Operations
 Our foreign operations as a percentage of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------+-------------------------+--

Ryerson China 
 In 2006, Ryerson Inc., formerly the direct subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, and VSC and its subsidiary, CAMP BVI, formed Ryerson China to enable us, through this foreign operation, to provide metals distribution services in China. We invested $28.3 million in Ryerson China for a 40% equity interest. We increased ownership of Ryerson China from 40% to 80% in the fourth quarter of 2008 for a total purchase cost of $18.5 million. We consolidated the operations of Ryerson China as of October 31, 2008. On July 12, 2010, we acquired VSC’s remaining 20% equity interest in Ryerson China for $17.5 million. As a result, Ryerson China is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Ryerson. Ryerson China is based in Kunshan and operates five processing and service centers in Guangzhou, Dongguan, Kunshan and Tianjin. 
Ryerson Mexico 
 Ryerson Mexico, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Ryerson Holding, operates as a metals service center. Ryerson Holding formed Ryerson Mexico in 2010 to expand operations into the Mexican market. Ryerson Mexico has service centers in Monterrey, Tijuana, Hermosillo, and Queretaro.
