Overview
 
PCTEL, Inc. (‘PCTEL’, the ‘Company’, ‘we’, ‘ours’, and ‘us’) was incorporated in California in 1994 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. PCTEL is a leading global provider of wireless technology, including purpose-built Industrial IoT devices, antenna systems, and test and measurement solutions. We strive to solve complex wireless challenges to help organizations stay connected, transform, and grow. We believe we have a strong brand presence and expertise in radio frequency (“RF”), digital and mechanical engineering. We have two product lines (antennas/Industrial IoT devices and test & measurement). Our antenna products include antennas deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management, IoT applications, and transit systems. Our Industrial IoT devices include ruggedized access points, IoT interface cards and IoT sensor platforms for applications such as logistics, remote monitoring and control. Our test & measurement products are designed to improve the performance of wireless networks globally. Mobile operators, private enterprises, and network equipment manufacturers rely on our products to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks. We seek out product applications that command a premium for product design and performance, and we avoid commodity markets. Our strength is solving complex wireless challenges for our customers through our products and solutions. To this end, we are constantly seeking to innovate and improve antenna and wireless testing products and capabilities to capture the opportunities of the rapidly evolving wireless industry. We focus on engineering, research, and development to maintain and expand our competitiveness.
 
In 2021, we acquired all the outstanding stock of Smarteq Wireless Aktiebolag, a Swedish company based in Kista, Sweden, that designs antennas for specialized Industrial IoT and vehicular applications (“Smarteq”), pursuant to a SPA between PCTEL and Allgon Aktiebolag, a Swedish company and holder of the outstanding stock of Smarteq (the “Agreement”). PCTEL paid cash consideration of SEK 56.8 million ($6.8 million) at the close of the transaction, all of which was provided from PCTEL’s existing cash. Smarteq owned all the outstanding stock of SAS Smarteq France (“Smarteq France”), which engaged in sales of Smarteq products. Smarteq France was merged into Smarteq Wireless Aktiebolag on November 1, 2022. We believe the acquisition of Smarteq provides a strong European presence, expertise, and channel partners that we expect will accelerate our growth in Europe, as well as a complementary portfolio of products for our Industrial IoT and intelligent transportation customers worldwide. The results for Smarteq are combined with the Company’s antenna and Industrial IoT device product line.

Revenue growth in these markets is driven by the increased use and complexity of wireless communications.

Our antenna portfolio includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Land Mobile Radio (“LMR”), Tetra, Global Navigation Satellite System (“GNSS”), Cellular, Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (“ISM”), Long Range (“LoRa”), and combination antenna solutions. The market applications for our antennas include public safety communications, military communications, utilities & energy, precision agriculture, smart traffic management, Electric Vehicle (“EV”) charging stations, passengers and cargo vehicles, forestry machinery & off-road vehicles. For smart traffic management, we provide antenna systems for smart roadways and smart rail. Fleet antennas for public safety, including police vehicles, is a key market. We not only manufacture the antennas, but we also provide engineering design services to determine the layout of multi-antenna installations to minimize potential interference between each antenna element. Our customized solutions often result in general purpose products with advance capabilities, such as multi-element antenna systems in a single radome. These systems can include several LTE bands, Wi-Fi bands and GPS navigation elements, all in one housing. An antenna designed for one application can be modified to be used for other applications.
 
Our Industrial IoT device portfolio includes access points, radio modules, sensor communication modules, and wireless communication sensors. The market applications for our Industrial IoT devices include utilities and smart grid, oil and gas, manufacturing, logistics, industrial automation, smart metering, and asset tracking.
 
Our strategy is to provide a “toolbox” of hardware solutions to our existing OEMs and distributors for Industrial IoT systems. We provide all of the field hardware required for wireless Industrial IoT systems - antennas, ruggedized Wi-Fi access points, radio modules, and integrated cellular sensors for Industrial IoT. Our go-to-market strategy for this growing sector is to sell more RF hardware components to our customers that traditionally purchase antennas from PCTEL.

Consistent with our mission to solve complex network engineering problems and to compete effectively in the antenna market, PCTEL maintains expertise in the following areas: radio frequency engineering, wireless network engineering, mechanical engineering, mobile antenna design, manufacturing, and product quality and testing. Competition among providers of antennas and Industrial IoT devices is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Panorama, Taoglas, and TE Connectivity.
 
Test & Measurement Products

PCTEL provides RF test & measurement products that improve the performance of wireless networks globally, with a focus on LTE, public safety, and 5G technologies. Revenue growth in this market is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G) and new market applications for public safety and government. The market applications for our test & measurement equipment includes cellular testing, public safety and private radio network testing, federal government communications testing, and indoor building network testing. Our portfolio includes scanning receivers, scanning receiver software, public safety solutions, automated spectrum monitoring solutions, interference location systems, mmwave transmitters, and a cloud-based reporting platform.
 
Our scanning receivers are software defined radios used to 1) confirm adequate RF coverage during deployment, 2) identify interfering signals which decrease capacity, 3) troubleshoot system performance issues as networks expand, and 4) benchmark competing networks because our scanning receivers can scan all technologies across all frequencies during one test. They are necessary for initial network deployment and throughout the entire life cycle of the mobile network. Most of our 4G scanners can be upgraded to 5G via firmware. Our new Gflex scanning receiver includes advanced features to address 5G and broader critical communication and government applications such as signal intelligence.

We provide test & measurement equipment to test in-building communication capability which is important for first responders, to certify buildings meet certain in-building wireless communication standards, and to test public safety networks, including P25, Tetra and digital mobile radio (“DMR”).

Our cloud-based reporting platform for public safety is a subscription-based service for test management, storage and analytics that allows stakeholders, including engineering service companies, building owners and government jurisdictions, to easily manage the data collection process and access final reports through an online map-based interface.
 
Consistent with our mission to solve complex network engineering problems and to compete effectively in the RF test & measurement market, PCTEL maintains expertise in the following areas: radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing (“DSP”) engineering, wireless network engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, and product quality and testing. Competitors for PCTEL’s test &
measurement products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, Rohde and Schwarz, and Viavi.
 
Vision and Strategy
 
As a global leader for RF hardware that enables wireless connectivity, we are focused on four key strategies:
 
Launch products: We respond rapidly to market trends and demand. Our vision is to provide the most robust and capable RF hardware products for our OEMs, distributors, and direct customers. We work with world class customers that are experts in their market segments. Our commitment to our customers is to provide the RF hardware that enables the most reliable wireless connectivity for their systems, whether it is for monitoring factory equipment, electricity distribution through smart grids, or other industrial applications. Our products include antennas, IoT radio devices, IoT sensor and modem platforms and our 4G/5G test & measurement equipment.
 
Expand Distribution Channels: Our strategy is to leverage the reach and vertical market knowledge of our OEMs and distributors. We focus on key distributors who align with our targeted market segments, including Industrial IoT, intelligent transportation and enterprise wireless. In addition to making the most of our research and development investments to develop new products, we believe we can increase shareholder value by adding key distribution partners that have broader reach and specific expertise such as providing Industrial IoT solutions or have regional strength.
 
Increase Market Share: We leverage our existing customer relationships to provide access points, sensors and other Industrial IoT RF products. We have made significant investments in developing new products that we can market and sell to our existing customer base using our same go-to-market strategy. Many of our customers who purchase antennas for Industrial IoT applications also need other products we offer, such as sensors, interface cards and access points.

Drive Operational and Financial Efficiency: We have a disciplined management team, and we will continuously improve processes and productivity including a focus on design for manufacturability.

Markets and Market Opportunity
 
There are two key market drivers for our long-term growth: Industrial IoT and 5G. We believe that Industrial IoT has the greatest long-term potential for our antennas and ruggedized radio devices to support smart utilities and automation for manufacturing and commercial applications. Industrial IoT will likely continue to be a growing market to address remote control and data analysis. The critical link for many of these systems is the wireless connection between the device and the core system, which is where PCTEL seeks to adds value with our antennas, radio devices and sensors. Enabling reliable and robust wireless connections is critical for wireless Industrial IoT.
 
5G is still in the early phases of deployment to address capacity in dense user areas. It has better reliability, security, and lower latency than Wi-Fi. Future releases and the availability of new shared spectrum will likely drive further investment in 5G to support private networks and neutral host services in valuable mid-range spectrum. Private networks provide a lower cost solution than cellular operators to support low latency applications for enterprises and remote operations for rural areas.

Customers

Our strategy is to leverage leading global OEMs and distributors to expand the reach of our products across multiple market segments and industries.

Our antennas and Industrial IoT devices are sold to OEMs where they are designed into their customers’ solutions. We also sell through distribution channels that promote and sell our products into specialized markets. We support our major stocking distributors, and we sell our antennas directly to customers where integration into larger systems is not required.
 
Our test & measurement solutions for the cellular market is sold directly to wireless carriers, engineering service providers, and rental companies or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. Our test & measurement solutions for public safety markets is sold to distributors and other engineering service providers.

We do not view customer concentration as a significant issue.

Research and Development- Intellectual Property
 
Given that our mission is to solve complex RF problems for our customers, research and development is essential to our long-term success. We work closely with our customers, consultants, and market research organizations to monitor and predict changes in the
wireless industry, including emerging industry standards. We continue to make substantial investments in engineering, talent, and research and development and we devote substantial resources to product development, innovation, and patent submissions.

We have approximately 124 patents and over 51 patents pending in the U.S. and other countries. The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes rather than for potential license revenue generation.
 Sales, Marketing and Support
 Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of new products. Our Global Marketing group is responsible for promotion and lead generation through managing our website, managing trade shows, social media, webinars and general material generation. Our sales function is managed under the Vice President, Global Sales who has primary responsibility for revenue generation and oversight of the worldwide sales force. PCTEL’s direct sales force is technologically sophisticated, and sales executives have strong industry domain knowledge. Our customers include OEMs, wireless equipment distributors and rental companies, public and private carriers, wireless infrastructure providers, and value-added resellers (“VARs”). Our direct sales force supports the sales efforts of our distributors and OEM resellers.
Manufacturing
 
We have historically done final assembly of most of our antennas in-house at our facilities in Tianjin, China, and Bloomingdale, Illinois. To optimize the cost structure of our antennas and reduce our fixed costs in China, we transitioned most of the manufacturing activities from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. This transition was completed during the first quarter 2022. The antennas related to the Smarteq acquisition are manufactured at contract manufacturers in Europe and Asia. We do final assembly of all our test & measurement products in-house at our facility in Clarksburg, Maryland.
 
By transitioning some of our manufacturing to multiple contract manufacturers with a variety of expertise, we avoid becoming dependent on any specific contract manufacturer. If any contract manufacturer is unable to provide timely or satisfactory services for us, our other contract manufacturers will be available, provided, however, that transitioning production to a different contract manufacturer could cause delays, disruption and additional costs that could negatively impact timely delivery of our products and our earnings therefrom. We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers, but we do have open purchase orders with several of our suppliers. As discussed elsewhere, we have we experienced higher freight and logistics costs and our business has been impacted by increased costs in materials, as well as component part shortages.
 
Human Capital
 Our employees are among our most valuable assets and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our global team.
We recognize that attracting, developing, and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. We offer employees competitive compensation and benefits, and resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diversity and expertise in our global businesses to fill key positions. We seek to hire people who share our values. We value technology, innovation, and the achievement of customer-driven success. We expect our employees to act with integrity, fairness, and respect. We invest in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success.

In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
Factors That May Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Future Operations
 
Risks Related to Our Business
 Our business model depends upon our ability to recognize significant emerging technologies in a timely manner and to innovate to solve the engineering problems presented by such emerging technologies.
 In order to provide solutions to complex engineering problems, we must anticipate which technologies are promising and will be adopted by our customers and potential customers, and we need to be engaged early in the development of these new technologies and products. If we expend resources on the wrong technologies or are not included in the development phase of new technologies that are widely adopted in our industry, we may miss the opportunity for meaningful participation or revenue generation. Missed opportunities like these could have a negative impact on our long-term competitiveness.
 We must attract and retain specific types of engineers and other skilled professionals who are capable of innovating and solving complex network engineering problems in order to be successful. In addition, we must create intellectual property or license or otherwise obtain it from third parties when necessary. We also must maintain our intellectual property. Failure to accomplish these tasks and manage the costs thereof will result in difficulty in distinguishing us from our competitors and may result in a significant loss of business or diminishing margin on our products.
Competition within the wireless product industry is intense and could result in decreased margins on our products or loss of key customers. Failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results.
 Competition in our industry can result from the following:
 •competitors, including foreign government-funded competitors, significantly reducing prices on their products causing disruption to our customer relationships,
 •customers demanding lower prices and requiring suppliers like us to engage in auctions and other forms of competitive bidding for purchase orders,
 •entrance of a significant competitor in the markets for our products, either from new participants, such as emerging low-cost international competitors, or because of a merger of existing competitors, and
 •competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products and delivery of their services. These competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets, obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products, or otherwise gain a competitive advantage.
 
Our business in foreign countries, in particular China, involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks.
 A portion of our manufacturing, procurement, research and development, product management, and sales are conducted outside the United States. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including: (i) fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and in particular the impact of a re-valuation of the Chinese Yuan, Swedish Krona, and Euro; (ii) impact of tariffs or other trade-restrictive cost or regulations among the countries in which we do business; (iii) difficulties in repatriation of earnings; (iv) disruption to our supply chain, whether as a result of the spread of COVID-19 or other factors which limit our ability to import materials and export products; (v) nationalist sentiment creating advantages for our competitors in their home countries; (vi) impact of labor unrest (vii) unexpected legal or regulatory changes, particularly changes to environmental, labor or manufacturing regulations; (viii) lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property rights and the risk of theft and forced transfer of intellectual property; (ix) difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel and managing international operations;(x) under-developed infrastructure; and (xi) other unfavorable political or economic factors which could include nationalization of the wireless communications or related industries. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks pertaining to our international activities, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.
 
All of our imports from mainland China are subject to U.S. tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25.0%. The tariffs apply to the antennas sent from our China-based contract manufacturers to our U.S.-based customers and components and materials sent from our China-based contract manufacturers to our Bloomingdale, Illinois facility for final assembly. Tariffs impact the gross margin that we earn on sales of our products because we have not been able to adjust all our prices on the affected products to cover the entire cost of the imposed tariffs. We will continue to monitor and adjust prices as market conditions permit. The impact of the tariffs on our future revenue and profitability is uncertain.
Disruptions in the worldwide economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Adverse and uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries, including inflation, higher interest rates, economic weakness, and potential recession, may have an adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and financial position. Economic conditions can be negatively impacted by market cycles, as well as by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as COVID-19), man-made or natural disasters (including events related to climate change), severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war (such as ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. In connection with ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, governments in the U.S., the U.K. and the E.U. have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia, Belarus, and certain parts of Ukraine. The current sanctions as well as any further escalation of geopolitical tensions, including potential destabilizing effects that the war in Ukraine may pose for the European continent or the global oil and natural gas markets, could have material adverse impacts on the markets where we do business, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain.
Any delays in our sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products.
 Sales cycles for our products with major customers can be lengthy, often lasting nine months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer requires volume production of our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for several reasons, including:
 •our OEM customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order, and
 •the development of new technologies and commercialization of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed.
 A significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is largely based on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional uncertainty that customers may decide to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without enough time for us to reduce our operating expenses.
 Disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chains could adversely impact our sales and reputation.
 We have limited in-house manufacturing capability. We assemble antennas in our facility in Bloomingdale, Illinois and a significant portion of our antennas are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. We do final assembly of our test & measurement products at our Clarksburg, Maryland facility, where we also add our proprietary software to the completed hardware platforms we design and have manufactured to our specifications. We may experience delays, disruptions, or capacity constraints or quality control problems at our assembly facilities, which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers. Any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers' operations could cause delayed product delivery, which could negatively impact our sales, competitive reputation, and position. Moreover, if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our products, either of which could materially affect our operating results and may lead to obsolete inventory.
 During 2022 our operations were impacted by global shortages of key electronic components for our products, and we have experienced long-lead times due to freight congestion and delays. We have increased inventory levels to limit the negative impact of component shortages and long-lead times. However, the impact of cost inflation, as well as, supplier component input availability may continue or worsen in 2023, and ultimately may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
 In addition, if for any reason our suppliers discontinue manufacturing materials used in our products, we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary. Either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs which we may not be able to pass along to our customers in increased prices.
 In summary, in order to be successful, we must manage our operations to limit the cost of product production, accurately forecast demand for our products, avoid excess production and inventory that results in waste or obsolescence, dual source critical materials to avoid shortages and delays in shipping, build for manufacturability and avoid excessive quality issues.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and poses risks to, our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.
 The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global health crisis that has adversely affected global economies, financial markets, and businesses and also caused disruption in both supply and demand for our products. Many components were difficult to obtain or were discontinued by the manufacturers resulting in manufacturing delays and necessitating a redesign of several of our products. We also experienced higher freight and logistics costs and our business has been impacted by increased costs in materials, as well as component part shortages. Although we have seen improvements, cost increases and logistics and supply chain constraints may persist or worsen in 2023, and ultimately may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Shutdowns of companies and facilities as well as economic and budgetary uncertainties negatively impacted demand. While spread of the pandemic has slowed and certain of the challenges have abated, the extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic going forward will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including the level of spread and emergence of variants and actions by governments and private enterprises to address such matters.

As the pandemic continues, we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, including rising costs, volatility in customer orders and purchases and inability to procure components and deliver finished products on time, which may be material. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted, and may further impact, the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.
 Future acquisitions, business combinations, and investments may not yield their intended benefits and our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our business.
 We may make acquisitions of or make large investments in, businesses that offer products and technologies that we believe would complement our products, including wireless products and technology. We may also acquire or invest in businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels. Even if we were to announce an acquisition, we may not be able to complete it. Additionally, any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks, including:
 •difficulty in integrating the technology, operations, internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business,
 •disruption of our on-going business,
 •difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction,
 •the diversion of management's attention from our existing business,
 •potential unknown liabilities associated with a business that we acquire or which we invest,
 •new and proposed regulations limiting the enforcement of noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements,
 •difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies,
 •tax, employment, logistics, and other related issues unique to international organizations and assets we acquire,
 •possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel, and
 •impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill, and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets.
 We expect that future acquisitions may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and our common stock. If consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock, this would further dilute our existing stockholders. We may also incur debt to pay for an acquisition which could impose restrictive covenants on how we conduct our business. In connection with any future acquisitions, including those acquisitions that we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. We are required to expense such as transaction costs are incurred, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
 A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.
 We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business, and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events, and human error. If a cyber-incident,
such as a phishing or ransomware attack, virus, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failure, impairment of data integrity, loss of data or other computer assets, adware or other similar issue, impairs or shuts down one or more of our computing systems or our information technology network, or the systems or networks of our third-party services providers, we may be subject to negative treatment and lawsuits. In addition, attention to remediating cyber incidents may distract our technical or management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Public announcements of such cyber incidents could occur, and negative perception of such cyber incidents could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and we could lose sales and customers. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense.
 We, our customers and our third-party service providers face an evolving threat landscape in which cybercriminals, among others, employ a complex array of cyber-attack techniques designed to access sensitive information or disrupt our operations, including, for example, the use of fraudulent or stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, denial of service and other types of attacks. While we have engaged experts in cybersecurity to advise us and we have taken protective measures, our information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems or those of our third-party service providers could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders’ intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access or misuse could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results.
 Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.
 We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States, China, Sweden and various other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination, litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.
 Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change concerns and other environmental, social and governance initiatives may negatively affect our business.

Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could adversely affect our business. There is increasing societal pressure to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Initiatives, including the Paris Climate Accord, could result in future legislation, regulatory measures or policy changes that would increase expenses and taxes and require operational changes and substantial capital expenditures.
 In addition, continuing political and social attention to other environmental, social and governance ("ESG") and sustainability issues has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional and local legislation, regulatory measures, reporting obligations and policy changes. Moreover, there is increased focus by investors, customers, and other stakeholders on ESG and sustainability matters, including the use of plastic, energy, waste, and worker safety. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Any or all of these ESG and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, cause us reputational harm, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Physical risks of climate change (such as natural disasters, extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) may impact operations at our and our supplier's facilities and the availability and cost of components, transportation and energy. Such risks could also increase insurance and other operating costs.

 Provisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable.
 Provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor. Specifically, our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent, do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting, and provide for a classified board of directors, which means stockholders can only elect, or remove, a limited number of our directors in any given year. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, and as a result, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor.

Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Further, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may decline.
