Item 1.    Business
Overview
Hilton is one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world, with 4,922 hotels, resorts and timeshare properties comprising 804,097 rooms in 104 countries and territories as of December 31, 2016. In the nearly 100 years since our founding, we have defined the hospitality industry and established a portfolio of distinct, market-leading brands. Our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts and Canopy by Hilton; our full service hotel brands, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Curio - A Collection by Hilton, DoubleTree by Hilton and Embassy Suites by Hilton; our focused service hotel brands, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton, Tru by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Home2 Suites by Hilton; our timeshare brand, Hilton Grand Vacations; and our new full service brand, Tapestry Collection by Hilton, launched in January 2017. As of December 31, 2016, more than 169,000 employees served in our managed, owned, leased and timeshare properties and corporate offices around the world, and we had approximately 60 million members in our award-winning customer loyalty program, Hilton Honors.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we operated our business through three segments: (i) ownership; (ii) management and franchise; and (iii) timeshare. Our ownership segment consisted of 141 hotels with 57,716 rooms as of 
2

December 31, 2016 in which we had an ownership interest or lease. Through our management and franchise segment, which consisted of 4,734 hotels with 738,724 rooms as of December 31, 2016, we managed hotels, resorts and timeshare properties owned by third parties and we license our brands to franchisees. Through our timeshare segment, which consisted of 47 properties comprising 7,657 units as of December 31, 2016, we marketed and sold timeshare intervals; operated timeshare resorts and a timeshare membership club; and provided consumer financing.
In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business through expanding our share of the global lodging industry through our development pipeline, which as of December 31, 2016 included approximately 310,000 rooms scheduled to be opened in the future, over 99 percent of which are within our management and franchise segment. As of December 31, 2016, over 157,000 rooms, representing half of our development pipeline, were under construction. The expansion of our business is supported by strong lodging industry fundamentals, including limited supply growth, in the current economic environment and long-term growth prospects based on increasing global travel and tourism. 
Overall, we believe that our experience in the hotel industry and strong, well-defined brands that operate throughout the lodging industry chain scales and commercial service offerings will continue to drive customer loyalty, including participation in our Hilton Honors loyalty program. Satisfied customers will continue to provide strong overall hotel performance for our hotel owners and us, and encourage further development of additional hotels under our brands and with existing and new hotel owners, which further supports our growth and future financial performance. We believe that our existing portfolio and development pipeline, which will require minimal capital investment from us, put us in a strong position to further improve our business and serve our customers in the future.
On January 3, 2017, we completed the previously announced spin-offs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as our timeshare business, into two additional and independent, publicly traded companies: Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. ("Park") and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. ("HGV"), respectively, (the "spin-offs"). The spin-offs were completed via a distribution to each of Hilton's stockholders of record, as of the close of business on December 15, 2016, of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Park and HGV. Each Hilton stockholder received one share of Park common stock for every five shares of Hilton common stock and one share of HGV common stock for every 10 shares of Hilton common stock. Both Park and HGV have their common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbols "PK" and "HGV," respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 29: "Subsequent Events" in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion. Unless otherwise stated herein, this Annual Report on Form 10-K presents our business and results of operations as of and for the historical periods presented, without giving effect to the spin-offs and based on the three segments we operated our business through prior to closing the spin-offs. Refer to pro forma financial information included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 4, 2017 for the historical results of operations and performance of Hilton giving effect to the spin-offs, and refer to the Registration Statements on Form 10 of Park and HGV and their subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC for their respective historical financial results. Additionally, refer to our press release on our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results for pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017. Neither the Registration Statements on Form 10 of Park and HGV, their subsequent periodic and other reports filed with the SEC, nor the pro forma financial information included in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 4, 2017 and February 15, 2017 are incorporated by reference herein.
On January 3, 2017, we completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Hilton's outstanding common stock (the "Reverse Stock Split"). The authorized number of shares of common stock was reduced from 30,000,000,000 to 10,000,000,000, and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock remains 3,000,000,000. All share and share-related information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split.

Members can also use points earned to transact with nearly 130 partners, including airlines, rail and car rental companies, credit card providers and others. The program provides targeted marketing, promotions and customized guest experiences to approximately 60 million members. Our Hilton Honors members represented approximately 56 percent of our system-wide occupancy and contributed hotel-level revenues to us and our hotel owners of over $17 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016. Affiliation with our loyalty programs encourages members to allocate more of their travel spending to our hotels. The percentage of travel spending we capture from loyalty members increases as they move up the tiers of our program. The program is funded by contributions from eligible revenues generated by Hilton Honors members and collected by us from hotels in our system. These funds are applied to reimburse hotels and partners for Hilton Honors points redemptions and to pay for program administrative expenses and marketing initiatives that support the program.

(1) | Includes properties owned or leased by entities in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Also includes 67 owned and leased hotels that were owned by Park effective January 3, 2017 as a result of the completion of the spin-offs.

Ownership
As of December 31, 2016, we were one of the largest hotel owners in the world based upon the number of rooms at our owned, leased and joint venture hotels. Our diverse global portfolio of owned and leased properties included a number of leading hotels in major gateway cities such as New York City, London, San Francisco, Chicago, São Paolo and Tokyo. The portfolio included iconic hotels with significant underlying real estate value, including the Hilton New York, Hilton Hawaiian Village and the London Hilton on Park Lane. Real estate investment was a critical component of the growth of our business in our early years. Our real estate holdings grew over time through new construction, purchases or leases of hotels, investments in joint ventures and the acquisition of other hotel companies. In recent years, we expanded our hotel system less through real estate investment and more by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements we have with third-party hotel owners. As noted in the "Overview" section, on January 3, 2017, we completed the spin-off of a portfolio of 67 of our owned and leased hotels and resorts to Park in continuation of this strategy. These hotels will continue to be a part of the Hilton system as managed and franchised properties pursuant to management and franchise agreements entered into in connection with the spin-offs.
As a hotel owner, we focused on maximizing the cost efficiency and profitability of the portfolio by, among other things, implementing new labor management practices and systems and reducing fixed costs. Through our disciplined approach to asset management, we developed and executed on strategic plans for each of our hotels to enhance the market position of each property and, at many of our hotels, we renovated guest rooms and public spaces and added or enhanced meeting and retail space to improve profitability. At certain of our hotels, we activated options for the adaptive reuse of all or a portion of the property to residential, retail or timeshare in order to deploy our real estate to its highest and best use. 
Management and Franchise
Through our management and franchise segment, we manage hotels and timeshare properties and license our brands to franchisees. This segment generates its revenue primarily from fees charged to hotel owners and to homeowners’ associations at timeshare properties. We grow our management and franchise business by attracting owners to become a part of our system and participate in our brands and commercial services to support their hotel properties. These contracts require little or no capital investment to initiate on our part, and provide significant return on investment for us as fees are earned.
Hotel and Timeshare Management
Our core management services consist of operating hotels under management agreements for the benefit of third parties, who either own or lease the hotels and the associated personal property. Terms of our management agreements vary, but our fees generally consist of a base management fee based on a percentage of the hotel’s gross revenue, and we also may earn an incentive fee based on gross operating profits, cash flow or a combination thereof. In general, the owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses our out-of-pocket expenses. In turn, our managerial discretion typically is subject to approval by the owner in certain major areas, including the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets. Additionally, the owners generally pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs; internet, technology and reservation systems expenses; and quality assurance program costs. Owners are also responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors reward program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. As of December 31, 2016, we managed 559 hotels with 165,320 rooms, excluding our owned and leased hotels and timeshare properties. 
The initial terms of our management agreements for full service hotels typically are 20 to 30 years. In certain cases, where we have entered into a franchise agreement, as well as a management agreement, we classify these hotels as managed hotels in our portfolio. Extension options for our management agreements are negotiated and vary, but typically are more prevalent in full service hotels. Typically, these agreements contain one or two extension options that are either for 5 or 10 years and can be exercised at our or the other party’s option or by mutual agreement. In the case of our management agreements with Park, assuming we exercise all renewal periods, the total term of the management agreements will range from 30 to 70 years.
Some of our management agreements provide early termination rights to hotel owners upon certain events, including the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria. Performance test measures typically are based upon the hotel’s performance individually and/or in comparison to specified competitive hotels. We often have a cure right by paying an amount equal to the performance shortfall over a specified period, although in some cases our cure rights are limited. 
In addition to the third-party owned hotels we manage, as of December 31, 2016, we provided management services for 47 timeshare properties owned by homeowners' associations and 141 owned, leased and joint venture hotels from which we recognized management fee revenues. Revenues from our owned and leased hotels are eliminated in our audited consolidated 
8

financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Following the spin-off of HGV, we no longer provide management services to the timeshare properties.
Franchising
We franchise our brand names, trade and service marks and operating systems to hotel owners under franchise agreements. We do not directly participate in the day-to-day management or operation of franchised hotels and do not employ the individuals working at these locations. We conduct periodic inspections to ensure that brand standards are maintained. We approve the location for new construction of franchised hotels, as well as certain aspects of development. In some cases, we provide franchisees with product improvement plans that must be completed in accordance with brand standards to remain in our hotel system. As of December 31, 2016, we franchised 4,175 hotels with 573,404 rooms. 
Each franchisee pays us a franchise application fee. Franchisees also pay a royalty fee, generally based on a percentage of the hotel’s total gross room revenue (and a percentage of food and beverage revenue in some brands), as well as a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs; internet, technology and reservation systems expenses; and quality assurance program costs. Franchisees also are responsible for various other fees and charges, including payments for participation in our Hilton Honors reward program, training, consultation and procurement of certain goods and services. 
Our franchise agreements for new construction and our franchise agreements with Park typically have initial terms of approximately 20 years and properties that are converted from other brands have initial terms of approximately 10 to 20 years. At the expiration of the initial term, we may have a contractual right or obligation to relicense the hotel to the franchisee, at our or the hotel owner’s option or by mutual agreement, for an additional term ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our franchise agreements with Park cannot be extended without our consent. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement upon specified events of default, including nonpayment of fees or noncompliance with brand standards. If a franchise agreement is terminated by us because of a franchisee’s default, the franchisee is contractually required to pay us liquidated damages.
Timeshare
HGV, our previously owned timeshare segment, generates revenue from three primary sources:

• | Timeshare Sales—HGV markets and sells timeshare interests previously owned by Hilton and third parties. HGV also sources timeshare intervals through sales and marketing agreements with third-party developers. This allows HGV to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of third-party developers using the Hilton Grand Vacations brand in exchange for sales, marketing and branding fees on interval sales, and to earn fees from resort operations and the servicing of consumer loans while deploying little up-front capital related to the construction of the property.


• | Resort Operations—HGV manages the HGV Club, receiving enrollment fees, annual dues and transaction fees from member exchanges for other vacation products. HGV generates rental revenue from unit rentals of unsold inventory and inventory made available due to ownership exchanges under the HGV Club program. HGV also earns revenue from retail and spa outlets at our timeshare properties.


• | Financing—HGV provides consumer financing, which includes interest income generated from the origination of consumer loans to customers to finance their purchase of timeshare intervals and revenue from servicing the loans.

HGV's primary product is the marketing and selling of fee simple timeshare interests deeded in perpetuity, developed either by us or by third parties. This ownership interest is an interest in real estate equivalent to annual usage rights, generally for one week, at the timeshare resort where the timeshare interval was purchased. Each purchaser is automatically enrolled in the HGV Club, giving the purchaser an annual allotment of club points that allow the purchaser to exchange his or her annual usage rights for a number of options, including: a priority reservation period to stay at his or her home resort where his or her timeshare interval is deeded, stays at any resort in the HGV system, reservations for experiential travel such as cruises, conversion to Hilton Honors points for stays at our hotels and other options, including stays at more than 4,300 resorts included in the RCI timeshare vacation exchange network. In addition, HGV operates the Hilton Club, which operates for owners of timeshare intervals at the Hilton New York, but whose members also enjoy exchange benefits with the HGV Club. As of December 31, 2016, HGV managed a global system of 47 resorts and the HGV Club and the Hilton Club had nearly 270,000 members in total. As noted in the "Overview" section, on January 3, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our timeshare business, and these timeshare properties will remain in Hilton's system as franchised properties pursuant to a license agreement with HGV.

Competition
We encounter active and robust competition as a hotel, residential, resort and timeshare manager, franchisor, owner and developer. Competition in the hotel and lodging industry generally is based on the attractiveness of the facility, location, level of service, quality of accommodations, amenities, food and beverage options and outlets, public and meeting spaces and other guest services, consistency of service, room rate, brand reputation and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points through a global system. Our properties and brands compete with other hotels, resorts, motels and inns in their respective geographic markets or customer segments, including facilities owned by local interests, individuals, national and international chains, institutions, investment and pension funds and real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). We believe that our position as a multi-branded manager, franchisor, owner and operator of hotels with an associated system-wide customer loyalty platform makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse lodging companies in the world. 
Our principal competitors include other branded and independent hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands and ownership companies, including hotel REITs. While local and independent brand competitors vary, on a global scale our primary competitors are firms such as Accor S.A., Carlson Rezidor Group, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Marriott International, Mövenpick Hotels and Resorts and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation.
Seasonality
The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer-base served. We generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters.
Cyclicality
The hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows, on a lagged basis, key macroeconomic indicators. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in room rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. As a result, in a negative economic environment the rate of decline in earnings can be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. The vacation ownership business also is cyclical as the demand for vacation ownership units is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchases of vacation ownership units, as well as general economic conditions and the relative health of the housing market.
Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive hospitality industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents are very important to the success of our business. We have a significant number of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, patents and pending registrations and expend significant resources each year on surveillance, registration and protection of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and patents, which we believe have become synonymous in the hospitality industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including: laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of franchises, many of which impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements and require that certain materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in a particular state; and extensive state and federal laws and regulations relating to our timeshare business, primarily relating to the sale and marketing of timeshare intervals.
In addition, a number of states regulate the activities of hospitality properties and restaurants, including safety and health standards, as well as the sale of liquor at such properties, by requiring licensing, registration, disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct. Operators of hospitality properties also are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Our franchisees are responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employee, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of our properties and could otherwise adversely affect our operations.

We also manage and own hotels with casino gaming operations as part of or adjacent to the hotels. However, with the exception of casinos at certain of our properties in Puerto Rico and one property in Egypt, third parties manage and operate the casinos. We hold and maintain the casino gaming license and manage the casinos located in Puerto Rico and Egypt and employ third-party compliance consultants and service providers. As a result, our business operations at these facilities are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the local regulatory agency responsible for gaming licenses and operations in those jurisdictions.
Finally, as an international owner, operator and franchisor of hospitality properties in 104 countries and territories, we also are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which we operate, including employment laws and practices, privacy laws and tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the U.S. and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences.
In addition, our business operations in countries outside the U.S. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. In addition to our hotel accommodations, we operate a number of laundry facilities located in certain areas where we have multiple properties. We use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our facilities, and we generate certain wastes in connection with our operations. Some of our properties include older buildings, and some may have, or may historically have had, dry-cleaning facilities and underground storage tanks for heating oil and back-up generators. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at some of our facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations where such wastes have been sent for disposal. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination pursuant to our management or franchise agreements, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove or contain mold, lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. We have implemented an on-going operations and maintenance plan at each of our owned and operated properties that seeks to identify and remediate these conditions as appropriate. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs relating to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Insurance
U.S. hotels that we manage are permitted to participate in certain of our insurance programs by mutual agreement with our hotel owners. If not participating in our programs, hotel owners must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. U.S. franchised hotels are not permitted to participate in our insurance programs but rather must purchase insurance programs consistent with our requirements. Non-U.S. managed and franchised hotels are required to participate in certain of our insurance programs. In addition, our management and franchise agreements typically include provisions requiring the owner of the hotel property to indemnify us against losses arising from the design, development and operation of hotels owned by such third parties.
Most of our insurance policies are written with self-insured retentions or deductibles that are common in the insurance market for similar risks and we believe such risks are prudent for us to assume. Our third-party insurance policies provide coverage for claim amounts that exceed our self-insurance retentions or deductible obligations. We maintain insurance

coverage for general liability, property including business interruption, terrorism, workers’ compensation and other risks with respect to our business for all of our owned and leased hotels. In addition, through our captive insurance subsidiary, we participate in a reinsurance arrangement that provides coverage for a certain portion of our deductibles. In general, our insurance provides coverage related to any claims or losses arising out of the design, development and operation of our hotels.
Corporate Responsibility
The success of our business is linked to the success of communities in which our hotels operate - from the local owners who partner with us to build hotels, to the local talent that operate the hotels, to the local economies and businesses our hotels support through sourcing products serving guests.
Travel with Purpose, our corporate responsibility strategy, is a holistic approach that leverages our global footprint and scale coupled with local insights and partnerships to address global and local challenges. Creating shared value for hotel employees, guests, owners, communities and overall business is a strategic priority we strive to achieve by focusing on advancing three priority, material issue areas: 

• | Creating opportunities - Youth Opportunity, Great Place to Work, Intrapreneurship: we have a passion, and a responsibility to invest in current and future employees. We open doors that help individuals build meaningful job and life skills through the hospitality industry.


• | Strengthening communities - Skills-based Volunteering, Human Rights, Disaster Support: we encourage and enable our employees to deliver hospitality to our communities. We are committed to having a positive economic and social impact on the millions of communities and lives we touch.


• | Preserving environment - Energy, Carbon, Water, Waste, Responsible Sourcing: as environmental stewards for the wellbeing of people and ecosystems in our communities, we protect the environment through efficient and responsible operations and sourcing.

LightStay, our proprietary corporate responsibility performance measurement platform, is a global brand standard that allows us to manage the impact of our hotels on the environment and global community through the measurement, analysis and improvement of our use of natural resources, opportunities created and community service.
