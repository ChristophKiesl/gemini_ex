 Corporate History
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 20, 2006 under the name "Zebra Resources Incorporated" (aka "Zebra Resources Inc."). At inception, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.

As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding increased from 32,000,000 shares of common stock to 64,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.

Effective March 17, 2010, we changed our name from "Zebra Resources Incorporated" to "American Paramount Gold Corp.", by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary American Paramount Gold Corp., which was formed solely for the change of name.

 On November 16, 2011, our company's board of directors approved a forty (40) for one (1) reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common shares.

On November 29, 2011 the Nevada Secretary of State accepted for filing a Certificate of Correction, wherein we effected an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to correct the Certificate of Change filed on November 28, 2011 to state that no fractional shares shall be issued and that fractional shares shall be rounded up rather than rounded down.
 The reverse split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 26, 2012 under the new symbol APGA. The CUSIP number was changed to 02882T 204.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Risks Related to Our Company
 The fact that we have not earned any operating revenues since our incorporation raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 We have generated minimal revenue from operations since our incorporation. Due to its inability to meet its debt obligation, the Company may have to forfeit ownership of the Solar Power System and thus lose its only revenue producing asset. We had cash of $515,903 as of August 31, 2021 ($23,114-August 31, 2020) and a working capital deficiency of $1,080,003. We have a cumulative net loss of $4,902,173 from our inception on July 20, 2006 through August 31, 2021. We estimate that our average annual operating expenses will be approximately $200,000 including management services and administrative costs. We have traditionally raised our operating capital from sales of equity securities, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so.

Management plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its capital stock. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern. Although there are no assurances that management's plans will be realized, management believes that our company will be able to continue operations in the future. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event our company cannot continue in existence. We continue to experience net operating losses.
 Risks Associated with Our Common Stock
 Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.
 Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Pinksheet service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Pinksheet is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.
 Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations and FINRA's sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.
 Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.

In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.
 Other Risks
 Trends, Risks and Uncertainties
 We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.
