     ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 General
 Midwest Holding Inc. (“Midwest,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) was formed in Nebraska in 2003 as a financial services holding company. We have two subsidiaries that we operate our business through; 1) American Life & Security Corp. (“American Life”), is a Nebraska-domiciled life insurance company with executive offices at 2900 South 70th Street, Suite 400, Lincoln, Nebraska 68506, phone number (402) 489‑8266, and 2) 1505 Capital LLC (“1505 Capital”),  a Delaware limited liability company, that provides financial and investment advisory and management services with an office at 100 Wall Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10038.
 As of December 31, 2019, statutory capital and surplus of American Life was approximately $19.5 million and it was rated “B++” (“Good”) by A.M. Best.
 Development of Business in 2019
 Our fiscal years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 were transformative for us through a recapitalization and new business plan.
 Change in Control in 2018 and Adoption of New Business Plan
 Change in Control
 On June 28, 2018, we underwent a change in control as a result of the closing of a Loan, Convertible Preferred Stock and Convertible Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement dated May 9, 2018 (the “Agreement”) with a non-affiliated third party, Xenith Holdings LLC, 

 
  3
 
a Delaware limited liability company (“Xenith”). Xenith is a wholly controlled subsidiary of Vespoint LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Vespoint”), which is also the manager of Xenith. Vespoint is owned and managed by AMS Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Rendezvous Capital LLC, a New York limited liability company. Each of these three companies is a private investment company; they are controlled by Michael Minnich and A. Michael Salem, who are Co-Chief Executive Officers of Vespoint.
 The terms and conditions of the Agreement are described in our Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 14, 2018. The Agreement was filed as an exhibit to the referenced Current Report on Form 8‑K.
 At the closing of the Agreement, we issued 1,500,000 shares of newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) to Xenith for $1,500,000, which was ranked senior to our voting common stock on liquidation with a preference of $1.00 per share. Annual dividends of 8% of the Series C Preferred Stock liquidation preference were payable by us. Prior to conversion on June 18, 2019, and at any time after June 28, 2025, Xenith could have required us to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock at the liquidation preference (plus accrued dividends) or fair market value, whichever was greater. The Preferred Stock voted along with the voting common stock on an “as converted” basis. Also, holders of Preferred Stock voting as a separate Series were entitled to elect five of the Company’s eight members of its Board of Directors. On June 18, 2019, all of the Series C Preferred Stock shares were converted, at Xenith’s election, into 72,854,474 shares of our voting common stock at approximately $0.02 per share. All accrued dividends were waived.
 Also, at closing of the Agreement, Xenith loaned a total of $600,000 to Midwest, repayable upon maturity in 10 years with cash interest of 4% per annum payable quarterly and accrued interest of another 4% per annum payable upon maturity. The loan was converted by Xenith into an aggregate 29,141,790 voting common shares on June 18, 2019.

 | Loan | | Common Stock into | | 
 | Principal | | which Loans Were | |

June 28, 2018 | | 1,500,000 | | 72,854,474 | | June 18, 2019
Total | $ | 20,600,000 | | 1,000,534,789 | | 

      Management Additions. At the closing of the Agreement, Xenith appointed three members to American Life’s five-person board of directors including Messrs. Minnich and Salem, who were subsequently appointed as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, of American Life. Messrs. Minnich and Salem are control persons of Xenith. Information with regard to Messrs. Minnich and Salem is set forth in Item 10 – Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.
 Also, upon closing of the Agreement, American Life entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Salem and Minnich and we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our President, Mark A. Oliver.
 Increased Capitalization. In connection with the Agreement, an amendment to increase the number of shares of our capital stock was approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders held on November 13, 2018. The total number of shares of capital stock of all classes of which we have authority to issue is now 2,000,000,000, consisting of 1,970,000,000 shares of voting common stock, 20,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

 New Business Plan
 Following the closing of the Agreement, we embarked on implementing our new business plan to leverage technology to create, sell and administer competitive life and annuity products through  independent marketing organizations (“IMO”) while reinsuring substantially all of the insurance policies we write with third-party reinsurers.
 The Business Plan. We are currently implementing our plan to become a leading, technology-enabled, services-oriented, life and annuity insurance company, with complementary policy administration and asset management services. Our primary objective is to leverage the product-development and policy administration-capabilities and the “B++” (“Good”) A.M. Best rating of American Life to create and sell life and annuity products through IMOs while reinsuring substantially all of the insurance policies we write with third-party reinsurers. This strategy is commonly referred to as “fronting.” The IMOs we have under contract offer life and annuity products, infrastructure and other services to independent insurance agents. A key component of our plan is to reinsure substantially all of the policies we write with third-party reinsurers, who assume the financial risk of our insurance and annuity policies. In a typical reinsurance transaction, we earn up front ceding commissions from the reinsurer and policy administration fees. In some cases, we earn asset management fees from reinsurers for managing assets they set aside to meet their reinsurance obligations. Our reinsurance strategy helps alleviate American Life’s regulatory capital and surplus requirements because policies that are reinsured by third parties require less capital and surplus reserves than policies retained by us. See “Reinsurance” below for further discussion. We are currently selling a multi-year guaranteed annuity (“MYGA”) and a fixed index annuity (“FIA”) product through three IMOs.
 We are seeking to create value through our ability to compete in the areas of:

· | life and annuity product innovation;
--+-------------------------------------


· | speed to market of new products;
--+---------------------------------


· | competitive insurance rates and commissions;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | streamlined customer and agent experience;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | ease and efficient cost of doing business using our technology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | asset management for insurers and reinsurers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | lower capital requirements through our use of reinsurance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

      Technology. We have developed a modern technology platform that enables us to develop, sell and administer a broad range of life and annuity products. Functional implementation of the platform began in early 2019. We license key components of our technology from third-party software providers, including product development, new business, distribution management and policy administration modules that are hosted in the Amazon Web Services cloud. In addition, several core technology integrations were added, including document management, electronic application capability, secure log-ins and an agent and policyholder portal. Management believes this technology should result in cost effective product development, sales and administration as we scale up through increased product sales and management also believes it will also provide us with the ability to expand third party administrative services. We continue to refine the functionality of our technology on an ongoing basis.
 2020 Plan. Our business objectives for 2020 are to develop additional insurance products in close consultation with our independent consulting actuary and IMOs that we believe have an in-depth understanding of the demands of the marketplace. Our goal is to create and adjust products quickly and cost effectively where we perceive (i) market demand, (ii) interest from IMOs and (iii) available reinsurance capacity. We may offer products exclusively through certain IMOs to develop specific products, giving the products a competitive advantage.
 Reinsurance of our Legacy Insurance Business. In conjunction with implementing our new business plan, in late 2018 American Life closed a reinsurance agreement with Unified Life Insurance Company, an unaffiliated Texas insurance company. Terms of this agreement are described in our Current Report on Form 8‑K, filed with the SEC on November 16, 2018. In the transaction, American Life received net proceeds of $3.5 million and the reinsurer assumed substantially all of American Life’s existing life insurance and annuity policies. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 79% of the business had been converted from “coinsurance” to “assumption”, thereby relieving American Life from any contingent liabilities on that portion of the ceded policies. See “Reinsurance” below for further discussion.

 Life and Annuity Insurance
 Insurance Policies
 We presently offer two products: the “American Classic,” a multi-year guaranteed annuity and the “American Select,” a fixed indexed annuity. We expect to expand our annuity product line and introduce other insurance products into the market in 2020, and thereafter in order to meet anticipated market demand. Any new insurance products we create must be filed with and approved by appropriate state insurance regulatory authorities before being sold.
 Our MYGA product is a five-year single premium deferred individual annuity contract. The guaranteed minimum cash surrender value is 87.5% of the single premium, less any partial withdrawal amounts, and accumulated at the nonforfeiture interest rate of 1.0% annually. A market value adjustment (“MVA”) is applied to the contract value and/or partial withdrawal amounts during any surrender charge period and is based on changes in the MVA index rate. The MYGA currently includes an Enhanced Interest Credit Rider, an Enhanced Liquidity Rider, a Surrender Charge Waiver Rider, and an Enhanced Death Benefit Rider. American Life began selling this MYGA product in the first quarter of 2019 and plans to continue selling the MYGA product in 2020 and subsequent years.
 Our FIA product is a long-term annuity product with an interest rate that is tied, in part, to a published stock market index. The FIA is a modified single premium with a minimum premium amount of $20,000. The guaranteed minimum cash surrender value is 87.5% of the single premium, less any partial withdrawal amounts, and accumulated at the nonforfeiture interest rate of 1.0% annually. A MVA is applied to the contract value and/or partial withdrawal amounts during any surrender charge period and is based on changes in the MVA index rate. The FIA product currently includes an Enhanced Liquidity Rider and an Enhanced Interest Credit Rider.  American Life began selling the FIA product in November of 2019 and plans to continue selling it in 2020 and subsequent years.
 In conjunction with our MYGA product launch, we executed selling agreements with three national IMOs that contract with numerous independent agents. These organizations are responsible for recruiting and training independent agents, although American Life also requires each agent to complete general courses in anti-money laundering, annuity products and annuity suitability, along with a specific training class on our annuity products.
 Our MYGA and FIA products were developed using the services of an independent qualified consulting actuary, Milliman, and we expect that any new products will utilize similar services. In addition to product development, Milliman serves as valuation actuary to American Life and also oversees its compliance and regulatory filings with various insurance regulatory authorities.
 The table below outlines American Life’s MYGA and FIA premiums earned by quarter during 2019 on statutory accounting principles basis:

 | | MYGA | | FIA 
 | | Premium(1) | | Premium(1)(2)
First quarter 2019 | $ | 8,292,617 | $ | — 
Second quarter 2019 | | 29,946,263 | | — 
Third quarter 2019 | | 41,261,292 | | — 
Fourth quarter 2019 | | 66,247,565 | | 15,616,831 
Total issued as of December 31, 2019 | $ | 145,747,737 | $ | 15,616,831 


(1) | Under statutory accounting principles, the MYGA and FIA premiums are treated as premium revenue. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) these products are defined as deposit-type contracts; therefore, the premium revenue under statutory accounting principles is accounted under GAAP as deposit-type liabilities on our balance sheet and are never recognized in our income statement. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | We began selling the FIA product in November 2019.
----+---------------------------------------------------

  Depending on market demand, over time we expect to consider writing a wide variety of insurance products, including fixed deferred, fixed indexed and other annuities, in addition to life and Medicare supplemental insurance products. Using our technology based product development model, we believe we can generate new product sales quicker and with a relatively small capital outlay compared to traditional insurance carriers.

 Reinsurance. 
 As indicated above, reinsurance is an integral part of our new business plan.  We expect to reinsure substantially all of our new insurance policies with a variety of third party reinsurers in exchange for upfront ceding commissions, expense reimbursements and administrative fees.  Under these reinsurance agreements, we expect there will be a monthly or quarterly settlement of premiums, claims, surrenders, collateral and other administration fees. We believe this will help preserve American Life’s capital while supporting its growth because American Life has lower capital requirements when its business is reinsured due to lower overall financial exposure versus retaining the insurance policy business itself.
 There are two main categories of reinsurance transactions: 1) “indemnity,” where we cede a portion of our risk but retain the legal responsibility to our policyholders should our reinsurers not meet their financial obligations; and 2) “assumption,” where we transfer the risk and legal responsibilities to the reinsurers.  The reinsurers are required to acquire the appropriate regulatory and policyholder approvals to convert indemnity policies to assumption policies.
 Our reinsurers may be domestic or foreign capital markets investors or traditional reinsurance companies seeking to assume U.S. insurance business. We plan to mitigate the credit risk relating to reinsurers generally by requiring other financial commitments from the reinsurers to secure the reinsured risks (such as posting substantial collateral). It should be noted that under indemnity reinsurance agreements American Life remains exposed to the credit risk of its reinsurers. If one or more reinsurers becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable or unwilling to pay claims under the terms of the applicable reinsurance agreement, American Life retains legal responsibility to pay policyholder claims, which, in such event would likely materially and adversely affect the capital and surplus of American Life.
 Some reinsurers are not and may not be “accredited” or qualified as reinsurers under Nebraska Law. In order to enter into reinsurance agreements with such reinsurers and to reduce potential credit risk, American Life may hold a deposit or withhold funds from the reinsurer or require the reinsurer to maintain a trust that holds assets backing up the reinsurer’s obligation to pay claims on the business it assumes. The reinsurer may also appoint an investment manager for such funds, which is some cases may be our investment adviser subsidiary, 1505 Capital, to manage these assets pursuant to guidelines adopted by us that are consistent with state investment statutes and reinsurance regulations. 
 American Life currently has five reinsurance agreements in effect and has earned ceding commissions on four out of those agreements in the last two years.  See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further information on each of our reinsurance agreements.  
 The table below shows the ceding commissions earned on the four most recent reinsurances transaction where American Life is earning ceding commissions on a statutory accounting principles basis:

(1) | Includes: acquisition and administrative expenses, commission expense allowance and product development fees.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The amounts shown as net deferred ceding commissions on December 31, 2019 represent the gross ceding commissions plus the expense allowances minus the commission and acquisition expenses plus interest expense of $105,627 minus the earned ceding commission of $171,649.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | These reinsurance transactions received gross ceding commissions on the effective dates of the transaction. The difference between the statutory net adjusted reserves and the GAAP adjusted reserves plus the elimination of DAC and VOBA related to these businesses reduces the gross ceding commission with the remaining deferred and amortized over the lifetime of the blocks of business.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | These reinsurance transactions include the ceding commissions and expense allowances which are accounted for as described in (2) above.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under statutory accounting principles, the ceding commission on the US Alliance Life and Security Company  (“US Alliance”) and the Unified Life Insurance Company (“Unified”) reinsurance transactions were accounted for as additions to surplus that will be amortized into income over the estimated life of the transferred blocks of business. The GAAP treatment for the ceding commission was to defer it to the balance sheet and amortize it over the expected life of the closed blocks of business. The US Alliance reinsurance agreement was an indemnity contract and the Unified reinsurance agreement is assumptive through policyholder approval on a policy-by-policy basis.  As of December 31, 2019, 79% of the business under the Unified agreement had been converted from the indemnity to assumed category. 
 The Ironbound Reinsurance Company Limited “(Ironbound”) and the SDA Annuity & Life Re (“SDA”) reinsurance agreements relate to our MYGA and FIA products. Under statutory accounting principles the ceding commissions under these agreements are earned and immediately recognized in the income statement of American Life.  
 Under GAAP, however, the ceding commissions received are not earned immediately but are recorded as a deferred liability and recognized as revenue over the estimated lives of the reinsured policies.  Under GAAP, the ceding commission received for the US Alliance and Unified transactions first reduced deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the value of business acquired (“VOBA”) on the related blocks of business, and the remainder was recorded as a liability to be recognized as revenue over the estimated lives of the contracts.  The allowance earned on the Ironbound and the SDA contracts first reduced the effect of the capitalization of new business expense deferred and the remainder was classified as a liability similar to the ceding commission earned and is being recognized as revenue over the same period that American Life established to amortize the DAC balance. 
 Underwriting and Suitability. 
 Our current annuity products have limited mortality and morbidity risk compared to traditional life insurance products, therefore, our focus is based on applicability and suitability of annuity products for the client. We have worked with Milliman, MVP Advisors and Regulatory Insurance Advisors, LLC to develop appropriate suitability guidelines to evaluate the: (i) purpose for a client’s selection of a product, (ii)  financial resources of the client/owner, (iii)  age of the client, (iv) effect on liquidity of a client, (v)  duration of the 

 
  8
 
product and (vi)  overall fit for the client. This information is captured through a questionnaire completed with a policy application that undergoes review at the IMOs and at American Life’s home office. Final determinations regarding suitability are made by American Life’s home office staff.
 Competition. 
 The life and annuity insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of the life insurance companies authorized to do business in states where we conduct business are well-established companies with good reputations that offer broader lines of insurance products, have larger selling organizations, and possess significantly greater financial and human resources than Midwest and American Life.
 Although we face significant competition on a product-by-product basis, we believe our business model, coupled with our relationships with IMOs, allows us to compete for insurance business due to our use of technology and small size, which we believe enables us to be nimble and adapt rapidly to changing insurance market conditions. Further, American Life received a rating of B++ from A.M. Best in 2019 and 2018, which we believe is a prerequisite to attract IMOs to offer our insurance products.
 Geographic Distribution. 
 American Life is licensed to sell, underwrite, and market life insurance and annuity products in 15 states and is actively seeking to expand its licenses in additional states. Accounting. 
 Our operating results in this report are reported in accordance with GAAP for stock life insurance companies, although American Life also prepares financial statements – and primarily manages its business – in accordance with statutory principles as adopted in its state of domicile, Nebraska. Statutory accounting has many significant differences compared to GAAP. For example, the incremental ceding commissions earned by American Life through reinsurance of new business, which are amortized under GAAP, are deemed to be earned immediately under statutory accounting principles. Investments. 
 The type and amount of investments that can be made by a life insurance company are specifically controlled by applicable state statutes and rules and regulations of the respective state departments of insurance. American Life has adopted investment policies in compliance with the insurance laws of the State of Nebraska.
 American Life has a long-term investment policy aimed at protecting capital and earning risk adjusted returns while insuring compliance with Nebraska’s insurance investment laws. Our investments are managed by 1505 Capital, who has many years of asset management experience. 
 On April 2, 2019, we purchased a 51% ownership in 1505 Capital, a Delaware limited liability company, which was established in 2018 to provide investment advisory and management services to primarily U.S. insurance clients. 1505 Capital has been engaged as the investment advisor for American Life, Ironbound and SDA through investment management agreements that contain investment guidelines.  Such agreements have been approved by insurance regulatory authorities as required.
 Reserves. 
 American Life establishes as liabilities actuarially computed reserves to meet the obligations on the policies it writes, in accordance with the insurance laws and the regulations of Nebraska, for statutory accounting and GAAP. Reserves, whether calculated under statutory accounting practices prescribed by various state insurance regulators or GAAP, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure, but instead represent our good faith estimates based on the relevant basis of accounting, generally involving actuarial projections, of what we expect claims will be based on mortality, longevity and lapse assumptions. The various actuarial factors are determined from mortality tables and interest rates in effect when the policies are issued and are applied against policy in force amounts. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has adopted new reserve rules to be used for statutory accounting. As of May 3, 2019, 50 jurisdictions adopted the revised model laws. The new method, referred to as Principle-Based Reserving (“PBR”) replaces the current formula approach on determining policy reserves to an approach that reflects the risk of highly complex products. 

 
  9
 
American Life did not report life insurance reserves on a PBR basis at December 31, 2019, and is deferring to implement under the transitional rules stated in Section II of the Valuation Manual until January 1, 2020 for new policies written. We believe that PBR should not impact us until we introduce traditional life insurance products to our line of business.
 Regulation. 
 American Life is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the insurance regulatory authorities of Nebraska, and other state insurance regulators where it is licensed to do business. This regulation is primarily for the benefit of policyholders rather than shareholders. The insurance regulators possess broad administrative powers, including the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business, approve the form of insurance contracts, regulate capital requirements, regulate the character of permitted investments, and require deposits for the protection of investments. Applicable insurance laws require the filing of a detailed annual report with the department of insurance in each state American Life is licensed to do business.
 As the holder of a controlling interest in American Life, Midwest is also subject to regulation as an insurance holding company system under the insurance laws of the state of Nebraska, which generally provide for restrictions on a change in control of the insurance holding company, require the filing of certain reports with the Nebraska Department of Insurance, and limit the amount of dividends which may be received by us from American Life.
 Financial Reform. 
 Enacted in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) reshapes U.S. financial regulations by creating new regulators, regulating new markets and firms, and providing enhanced enforcement powers to regulators. Virtually all major areas of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to regulatory interpretation and implementation rules requiring rulemaking. We do not believe that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results or financial condition. Tax Reform. 
 U.S. tax legislation, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“New Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017. The New Tax Act made fundamental changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that impacted the Company. The primary impact on our 2018 financial results was associated with the effect of reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% which required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower rate at December 22, 2017, the date of enactment. Other provisions of the New Tax Act that will impact us, include, but are not limited to: 1) provisions reducing the dividends received deduction; 2) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); 3) changing the rules regarding use of net operating losses; and 4) changing the way in which tax reserves will be measured. To date this Act has not had a material adverse effect on us. Employees
 As of December 31, 2019 we had 24 full-time employees. Our insurance sales are made through independent agents selling through third-party IMOs.
 Third-Party Services
 As a small part of our business over the past several years we have provided third party administrative services (“TPA”) to insurance providers. As part of our new business plan we expect to seek to expand this area of our business through leveraging our technology infrastructure and expertise in seeking to provide specialty administration services to other insurers. In 2019 we provided limited TPA services to one unaffiliated customer. Available Information

     Recent Developments
 We continue to closely monitor developments related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak to assess any potential impact on our business. We currently do not anticipate that this outbreak will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity; however, due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of this event, it currently is not possible to provide an estimate of potential insurance or reinsurance exposure or the indirect effects the outbreak may have on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
