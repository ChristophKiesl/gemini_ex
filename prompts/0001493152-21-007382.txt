Decentralized’s financing was made as an investment that would help accelerate Sharing Services sales and growth, as well as international expansion, with the expectation that such capital reserves would help make Sharing Services a dominant player in the global marketplace over the next two years. It was reported that the new $30 million investment would have the potential to exponentially increase Sharing Services sales channels and substantially expand its product portfolio, and to position Sharing Services to capitalize on consolidation and roll up opportunities of other direct selling companies. In the joint announcement, Sharing Services reported that the additional funding would now allow it to accelerate its global expansion with a direct focus on the Asian markets, and specifically in countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines.

Reporting Operationing Segments:
 
As we have reported above, we financially report business operating results on only four operating segments, which we believe will certainly increase and transition as the newer lines of business develop. However, the four business lines that we are reporting on in 2020 are as follows:
 
Premier Packaging - Operating under the name Premier Packaging Corporation (a New York corporation), produces custom consumer packaging serving clients in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, beverage, specialty foods, photo packaging, and direct marketing industries, among others. The group also provides active and intelligent packaging and document security printing services for end-user customers along with technical support for our technology licensees. The division produces a wide array of printed materials, such as folding cartons and paperboard packaging, security paper, vital records, prescription paper, birth certificates, receipts, identification materials, entertainment tickets, secure coupons, and parts tracking forms. The division also provides resources and production equipment for our ongoing research and development of security printing and related technologies.
 
Digital Group - This division researches, develops, markets, and sells worldwide the Company’s digital products, including and primarily our AuthentiGuard® product, which is a brand authentication application and consumer engagement product that integrates the Company’s counterfeit deterrent technologies with proprietary digital data security-based solutions. The AuthentiGuard® product allows our customers to implement a security mark utilizing conventional printing methods that is copy- and counterfeit-resistant and that can be read and recorded utilizing smartphones and other digital image capture devices, which can be utilized by that customer’s suppliers, field personnel and customers throughout its global product supply and distribution chains.
 
IP Technology - Since its acquisition in 2013, DSS Technology Management Inc.’s primary mission has been to monetize its various patent portfolios through commercial litigation and licensing. Except for investment in its social networking related patents, we have historically partnered with various third-party funding groups in connection with patent monetization programs. As management announced in its 2019 shareholder meeting, management intended to de-emphasize and ultimately wind down this business line. Management reported that while it would continue to assert and defend the existing patents and purse potential infringements as they are identified, it did not intend to seek out new patent portfolios. As the 2020 financial reporting confirms, management implemented that business plan IP is currently focused on managing two remaining patent portfolios.
 
Direct Marketing/Online Sales Group - Direct marketing or network marketing is designed to sell products or services directly to the public through independent distributors, rather than selling through the traditional retail channels. We believe this business has significant growth potential in the now popular “gig economy”. Consistent with the Company’s strategic business plan and vision, we have entered into the direct marketing or network marketing industry and plan to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the industry. We are engaging in partnerships with existing direct marketing companies to access U.S., Canadian, Asian, and Pacific Rim markets. In addition, we have, and/or are acquiring various domestic and international operating licenses to further the growth of this division. But in addition, we have developed or procured product licenses, formulas, sales networks, patents, web sites, and other resources to help us accelerate our sales and revenue generation initiatives for this line, and we have launched our HWHGIG and HWH Marketplace direct selling platforms.

2019-2020 Strategic Business Plan, and its 2021 Progression:
 
In November 2019, management announced that the Company’s 2019-2020 strategic business plan was to revitalize the company by focusing on strengthening the organization by (i) exiting unprofitable business lines, (ii) investing in and reviving the Company’s core businesses, (iii) improving top line revenues and net margins, (iv) controlling costs and (v) creating new long-term scalable, recurring revenue streams. To realize those goals, management announced that it would execute the strategic plan by:
Exiting Unprofitable Business Lines:
 
In 2019, the Company had 4 business lines: Premier Packaging, Digital Group, the IP Technology, and DSS Plastics Printing. At that time, only the Premier Packaging division was generating reoccurring revenue and positive cash flow with annual revenues of $13.5 million and a net EBIDA of approximately $742,000. Conversely, the other 3 business units lost approximately $1,348,000, with the IP Technology group accounting for $475,000, and DSS Plastic Printing accounting for an additional $294,000. To preserve capital and stop further cash drain, the decision was made to exit both business lines, whether by sale, wind down, closure, or by no longer pursuing business opportunities in this area.
Wind Down IP Monetization Program:
 
Since entering the intellectual property monetization business in July 2013, we have invested substantial capital and resources into purchasing, maintaining, and enforcing our patents. We have also invested substantial resources in the research and development of internally generated intellectual property for our own use, and/or for potential profitable licensing opportunities.
 
However, the costs of funding a patent pool, including patent maintenance fees, litigation (costs for legal counsel, discovery, consultants, expert witnesses, and travel), and overhead costs associated with the IP business line, had placed a significant financial strain upon the Company. During 2019, our corporate cash burn exceeded approximately $200,000 per month, primarily due to recurring costs related to the IP monetization line of business, which reduced resources for our other lines of business, as well as our own patent research and development projects. Further, because the related IP legal costs are expensed in the year incurred with no corresponding revenue generation, the financial impact to the Company caused us to routinely report negative operating income year over year. Moreover, as a result of the IP monetization line’s high capital demand, the Company did not have the capital to initiate and sustain IP litigation against potential major infringers of DSS patents.


Further, as a result of several court decisions and statutory changes, the patent laws in the United States have changed significantly since our entry into this business. Consequently, the enforcement of patents has become more costly and more difficult for DSS and other patent holders, and the likelihood of successful litigation has significantly decreased. In addition, depending upon the type of IP involved and the parties who are the alleged patent infringers, the legal enforcement and recovery process can take five or more years before the matter goes to trial. For instance, the Apple litigation, which we have previously disclosed, and which is described in more detail herein, was initiated in September 2013 and was scheduled to go to trial in late February 2020; a period of approximately 6 ½ years.
 
As a result of the considerable financial, working capital, and resource allocation to the IP monetization program, we executed a critical review of the program. We examined all elements and factors related to the operations of this business line, including what we hold in inventory of patents, the potential of that patent portfolio, the timetables involved to monetize those patents, the cost of capital to maintain the patents to monetization, and the probability of successful monetization. As a result of that extensive review, we determined that it was in the best interest of DSS and its stockholders to de-emphasize and ultimately exit the IP monetization line of business.
 
In 2020, management discontinued making any further patent acquisitions in this business line, and, more importantly, was able to renegotiate all of its previous contracts with its lenders, attorneys, and other professionals to eliminate most, if not all, of the historical losses and cash burn from this division. We will continue to manage the existing patent portfolio and work to maximize those assets. After the conclusion of these pending matters, we intend to close this business line.
 
Divesting DSS PLASTICS:
 
In 2020, we also made the decision to divest the DSS Plastics Group. The DSS Plastics Group manufactured laminated and surface printed cards which included magnetic stripes, bar codes, holograms, signature panels, invisible ink, micro fine printing, biometric, radio frequency identification (RFID), and watermarks for printed plastic documents such as ID cards, event badges, and driver’s licenses. As a result of continued historical downward trends of the plastic printing business, mostly due to deteriorating margins due to international competition primarily from China, and increasing operating costs of this San Francisco based company, long term major restructure changes and retooling had been planned to return the company to profitability. But the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic shut-down had a major impact on revenues. The impact of Covid, coupled with the negative long-term trend of the plastic card industry being replaced by facial recognition, digital licenses, and identification by individual cell phones, forced us to expedite and ultimately divest the business in 2020
 
In August 2020, the Company sold the primary assets of DSS Plastics Group to a subsidiary of Bristol Graphics for $683,000 at closing, and a contingency payment (earnout) of $517,000 that may be earned over the following 12-month period, $390,000 of which was recognized in 2020. The remaining asset and liability of this division is its lease space located in Brisbane, California. We are in the process of subleasing that facility and expect to consummate a transaction in the 2nd quarter which we expect will release the Company from that trailing lease liability, and thereafter expected final closure.

Reviving the Company’s Core Businesses:
 
In 2018, the Premier Packaging and the Digital Group collectively accounted for 78% of the Company’s operating revenues. But while, the two business lines accounted for the lion’s share of the Company’s operating revenue, they were doing so on minimal marketing and operating budgets, and in the case of Premier Packaging, with aged and obsolete equipment with limited remaining life. Management reviewed the business lines of both Premier Packaging and the Digital Group and believed that the core business of each was sound, that DSS held a market niche and/or growth opportunity in each, and that long-term profitability could be achieved with additional investments and changes. In 2020, management made substantial adjustments to revive and improve the productivity and operating revenue of these two divisions.
 
In 2018, Premier Packaging and Digital collectively reported $14,500,000 in operating revenue, $12,957,000 and $1,543,000 respectively, or approximately 78% of the company’s operating revenue that year. In 2019, after initial revitalization efforts, operating revenues grew a combined 5%, and in 2020, after a reduction in sales to each of their two largest customers by 26%, the two divisions reported $15.3 million in revenues, during a harsh pandemic impacted economic period.


Substantially Reducing Corporate Overhead and Cash Burn: 
 
Since the spring of 2019, we have reduced the Company’s monthly cash burn by eliminating non-essential layers of management and redundant operating expenses, as well as by renegotiating vendor contracts. The goal was, and is, to continue to reduce overhead operating costs, redundancy, improve operating efficiencies, and reduce cash burn through a continuing series of new management initiatives.
Implementing Business Diversification Initiatives:
 
One of the most important initiatives of the 2019 strategic business plan was the goal, and commitment, to diversify the Company’s operating revenue. Management believed it imperative to transition the Company’s revenue into new business lines which generated scalable and reoccurring revenue, preferably in exponential and emerging growth business opportunities. To achieve this goal, management sought to acquire, to invest in, or to start-up new business lines that met this criterion. We also planned to add additional products to existing business lines so that existing operations could further transition more toward scalable reoccurring revenue streams.
 
Toward that initiative, in 2019 and continuing through 2020 the Company either acquired, invested in, or started-up new businesses in the biohealth, direct marketing, blockchain, and securities trading fields. In 2020, the Company made substantial investments in the following new business lines:
 
● DSS BIOHEALTH SECURITY, INC. This business line was intended to be principally involved in the bio-medical sector, including investing in companies that hold bio-medical intellectual property and/or have, or are securing, strategic alliances, partnerships, and distribution rights for bio-medical and security products, technologies, or enterprises. This new division was also organized to seek out investment and growth opportunities in on open-air defense initiatives that seek to curb transmission of airborne infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza, among others, in open areas, and to seek investments in the oncological cures for various forms of cancer.
 
In 2019, the Company made a substantial commitment to this division by acquiring Impact BioMedical, Inc. in an approximate $50 million all stock acquisition. The Impact Bio acquisition, which was rich with assets, has a foundation of products with international market opportunities and demand, and which can be structured into long- term scalable, reoccurring license revenue. By leveraging technology and new science with strategic partnerships, Impact BioMedical drives mission-oriented research, development, and commercialization of solutions for medical advances in human wellness and healthcare.
 
● Direct Marketing/Online Sales Group, The Direct Marketing / Online Sales industry was a market that we believed would help us diversify and meet our scalable reoccurring revenue target in an exponential growth industry with high profit margins. The direct marketing, network marketing, or online sales is designed to sell products or services directly to the public through independent distributors, rather than selling through the traditional retail market. We believed that with the transition of a significant sector of retail sales now converting to the now popular “gig economy”, an investment in this business model would meet our strategic business plan objective and vision. We believed that we could profitably serve this market through lending opportunities, acquisition opportunities, and global partnership ventures.

Toward this objective, we made substantial investments in loans and investments into several direct marketing companies in 2019 and 2020. Notable in this area was our $8+ million investment into Sharing Services Global Corporation, located in Dallas, Texas, and the Company’s start-up of HWH World, Inc. and its national and international sales network. Further, on March 1, 2021, Decentralized announced that a binding letter of intent had been executed in which it increased its investment in Sharing Services through a $30 million convertible promissory note. The $30 million is planned to exponentially increase Sharing Services sales channels, substantially expand its product portfolio, and to position Sharing Services to capitalize on consolidation and roll up opportunities.
 
● BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, This corporate business line was organized in 2019 to specialize in the development of blockchain security technologies for tracking and tracing solutions for supply chain logistics and cyber security across global markets. While no significant acquisitions were made over the past 18 months, this business line is still deemed to be an important business line for our long-term diversification goals.
 
● SECURITIES AND FINTECH GROUP The Securities business line was be organized as part of the 2019 strategic business plan to establish or acquire investments in long-term growth and sustainable scalable reoccurring management fee income. The businesses that were to be targeted in this business plan included investments in alternative trading systems and related platforms, REITs, brokerage and other trading fund management platforms that would create recurring fee income.
 
FOR 2021:
 
Our business goal for 2021 is continue many of the 2019-2020 Strategic Goals, including to continue to grow the company with sound acquisitions, to develop and to grow Premier Packaging with major capital investments, and to place a heavy emphasis improving top line revenue and top line revenue diversification and profitability. But special attention, effort, and resources will be made to further the following 2021 business initiatives:
 
● Continue to revitalize and grow Premier Packaging.
 
● Make further investments in the Direct Securities and BioHealth groups in the form of growth and investments.
 
● Focused effort to double top line revenue and bottom- line profitability.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our ability to compete effectively depends largely upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, products and manufacturing processes. Across the DSS ecosystem of companies, we principally rely upon patent, trademark, trade secrets and contract law to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
 
As it applies to our digital division’s product line development, we have expended significant resources on research and development in an effort to become a market leader with the ability to provide our customers effective solutions against an ever-changing array of counterfeit risks. Our position in the security print market is based on our technologies and products. The Company recognized a credit in 2019 of approximately $12,000 primarily due to receipt of a refund on development costs for the development of proprietary blockchain solutions for the Company’s AuthentiGuard product line. In comparison, the Company spent approximately $146,000 on research and development during 2018, primarily toward the development of the Company’s AuthentiGuard product line.
 
Related to out Impact BioMedical Division we have key patents that we will use as the foundation for foster product development and licensing. We have 5 patents for some of our key products including Linebacker, Equivir/Nemovir, Laetose and 3F. Our intellectual property will enable us to be protected as we further these technologies and pave the road to commercialization.

Markets and Competition
 
As to the security printing business, the security print market is comprised of a few very large companies and an increasing number of small companies with specific technology niches. The expansion of this market is primarily due to the significant expansion of counterfeiting as advancing technologies in digital duplication and scanning combined with increasingly sophisticated design software has enabled easier reproduction of original documents, vital records and IDs, packaging, and labels. Our competitors include Standard Register Company, which specializes in printing security technologies for the check and forms and medical industries; and De La Rue Plc, that specializes in printing secure currency, tickets, labels, lottery tickets and vital records for governments and Fortune 500 companies. Large office equipment manufacturers, called OEMs, such as Sharp, Xerox Canon, Ricoh, Hewlett Packard and Eastman Kodak are developing “smart copier” technology that recognizes particular graphical images and produces warning words or distorted copies. Some of the OEMs are also developing user assigned and variable pantograph “hidden word” technologies in which users can assign a particular hidden word in copy, such as “void” that is displayed when a copy of such document is made. In addition, other competing hidden word technologies are being marketed by competitors such as NoCopi Technologies which sells and markets secure paper products, and Graphic Security Systems Corporation, which markets Scrambled Indicia.
 
Our packaging division competes with a significant number of national, regional and local companies, many of which are independent and privately-held. The largest competitors in this market are primarily focused on the long-run print order market. They include large integrated paper companies such as West Rock Company, Caraustar Industries, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company and Mead Westvaco. Our printing division competes primarily with locally-based printing companies in the Rochester and Western New York markets. Most of our competitors in these markets are privately-held, single location operations.

As to our Digital Group, our technology division also faces competition in the area of patent acquisitions and enforcement. Entities such as Acacia, RPX, AST, Intellectual Ventures, Wi-LAN, MOSAID, Round Rock Research LLC, IPvalue Management Inc., Vringo Inc. and Pendrell Corporation compete in acquiring rights to patents and product authentication from companies like Authentix, Opsec, and Alpvision that have similar technology to help protect against fraud and authenticate consumer packaged goods. .
 
As to the Direct Marketing Group, the network marketing or direct marketing industry is a very competitive marketplace. While not directly competing with HWH and SHRG, the following companies are significant players in the global network marketing business and as a result an indirect competitor of HWH and SHRG: Amay, Avon, Herbalife, Natura, Vorwerk, Mary Kay, Infinitus, Perfect, Forever Living, Nu Skin, Young Living, and New Era, among others.
 
Customers
 
During 2020, two customers accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2020, these two customers accounted for 60% of our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2019, these two customers accounted for 45% of our consolidated revenue and 48% of the Company’s consolidated trade accounts receivable balance. This customer diversification improvement was driven by addition of several new customers to our overall customer base.
Raw Materials
 
As to the packaging business, the primary raw materials the Company uses in its businesses are paper, paperboard, corrugated board and ink. The Company negotiates with leading suppliers to maximize its purchasing efficiencies and uses a wide variety of paper grades, formats, ink formulations and colors. Paper and paperboard prices continued to increase in 2020, and we believe increases in future years are expected. Except for certain packaging customers where the Company enters into annual contracts, for which changes in paperboard pricing is absorbed by the Company, the Company has historically passed substantially all increases and decreases to its customers, although there can be no assurances that the Company will continue to do so in the future.
Environmental Compliance
 
It is the Company’s policy to conduct its operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. While it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Government Regulation
 
We play an active role with the Document Security Alliance group, as one of our research and development management members sits on various committees of that group and has been involved in design recommendations for important U.S. documents. This group of security industry specialists was formed by the U.S. Secret Service to evaluate and recommend security solutions to the federal government for the protection of credentials and vital records.
 
Our patent monetization business is also faced with potential government regulations. If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our patent monetization efforts and, in turn, our assets, expenses and revenue. United States patent laws have been amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. The America Invents Act includes several significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities, such as our Company, on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could adversely impact our ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.
 
Moreover, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.
