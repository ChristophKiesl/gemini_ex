Overview
We are a global products company, serving the drilling, downhole, subsea, completions and production sectors of the energy industry. We design, manufacture and distribute products and engage in aftermarket parts supply and services that complement our product offering. The Company's products include highly engineered capital equipment as well as products that are consumed in the drilling, well construction, production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These consumable products are used in drilling, well construction and completions activities, within the supporting infrastructure, and at processing centers and refineries. Our engineered capital products are directed at drilling rig equipment for new rigs, upgrades and refurbishment projects, subsea construction and development projects, pressure pumping equipment, the placement of production equipment on new producing wells, and downstream capital projects. In 2020, over 80% of our revenue was derived from consumable products and activity-based equipment, while the balance was primarily derived from capital products with a small amount from rental and other services.
We seek to design, manufacture and supply high quality reliable products that create value for our diverse customer base, which includes, among others, oil and natural gas operators, land and offshore drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, subsea construction and service companies, and pipeline and refinery operators. 
Our reporting segments align with business activity drivers and the manner in which management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Forum operates in the following three reporting segments: Drilling & Downhole, Completions and Production. We believe that the reporting segment structure is aligned with the key phases of the well cycle and provides operating efficiencies. 
We incorporate by reference the segment and geographic information for the last three years set forth in Note 18 Business Segments, and the information with respect to dispositions set forth in Note 4 Dispositions.
Drilling & Downhole segment
In our Drilling & Downhole segment, we design, manufacture and supply products and provide related services to the drilling, downhole and subsea markets. Through this segment, we offer drilling technologies, including capital equipment and a broad line of products consumed in the drilling process; downhole technologies, including cementing and casing tools, protection products for artificial lift equipment and cables. The segment also supplies subsea technologies, including robotic vehicles and other capital equipment, specialty components and tooling, a broad suite of complementary subsea technical services.
There are several factors that drive demand for our Drilling & Downhole segment. Our Drilling Technologies product line is influenced by global drilling activity; the level of capital investment in drilling rigs and equipment replacement as drilling contractors modify or replace existing rigs to increase capability or improve efficiency and safety; the number of rigs in use and the severity of operating conditions. Our Downhole Technologies product line is impacted 
by the level of well completion activity and complexity of well construction and completion. Demand for our subsea products is affected by global offshore activity, defense spending, subsea equipment and pipeline installation, repair and maintenance expenditures, and growth in offshore resource development.

We design and manufacture a full portfolio of centralizers, float equipment, stage cementing tools, inflatable packers, flotation collars, cementing plugs and surge reduction equipment. Our products are used globally in the construction of onshore and offshore wells.
Our primary customers in this product line are oil and natural gas producers, and service companies providing completions, artificial lift and other intervention services to producers.
Subsea Technologies. We design and manufacture capital equipment and specialty components used in the subsea sector and provide a broad suite of complementary technical services. We have a core focus on the design and manufacture of remotely operated vehicle (“ROV”) systems, other specialty subsea vehicles, and rescue submarines, as well as critical components of these vehicles. Many of our related technical services complement our vehicle offerings.
Subsea vehicles. We are a leading designer and manufacturer of a wide range of ROVs that we supply to the offshore subsea construction, observation and related service markets. The market for ROVs can be segmented 
into three broad classes of vehicles based on size and category of operations: (1) large work-class vehicles and trenchers for construction and installation activities, (2) drilling-class vehicles deployed from and for use around an offshore rig and (3) observation-class vehicles for inspection and light manipulation. We are a leading provider of work-class and observation class vehicles.
We design and manufacture large work-class ROVs through our highly respected Perry® brand. These vehicles are principally used in deepwater construction applications. In addition to work-class ROVs, we design and manufacture large trenchers that travel along the sea floor for trenching, installation and burial operations. The largest of these trenchers is able to cut over three meters deep into the seafloor to lay pipelines, power cables or communications cables for customers in the pipeline, renewables and telecom markets.
Our Forum Sub-Atlantic® branded observation-class vehicles are electrically powered and are principally used for inspection, survey and light manipulation, and serve a wide range of industries. 
In addition to ROVs, we design and manufacture subsea rescue vehicles capable of a range of tasks, including submarine rescue operations, diver support, seabed survey, port security, under hull search and a variety of other tasks. 
Our subsea vehicle customers are primarily large offshore construction companies, including non-oil and natural gas entities, such as a range of governmental organizations including naval, maritime science and geoscience research organizations, offshore wind power companies, and other industries operating in marine environments. 
Subsea products and technical services. We are also a leading designer and manufacturer of subsea products and components utilized in conjunction with ROVs for the oil and natural gas, renewables, telecommunications and defense markets. We manufacture Dynacon® branded ROV launch and recovery systems, linear cable engines, Sub-Atlantic® branded ROV thrusters, and a wide range of hydraulic power units and valve packs. We design and manufacture these ROV components for incorporation into our own vehicles as well as for sale to other ROV manufacturers. We also provide a broad suite of subsea tooling, both industry standard and custom designed, and technical services.
Completions segment 
In our Completions segment, we design, manufacture and supply products and provide related services to the coiled tubing, stimulation and intervention markets. Through this segment, we offer stimulation and intervention technologies, including hydraulic fracturing pumps, cooling systems, flow iron, wireline cable and pressure control equipment as well as related recertification and refurbishment services. We also offer coiled tubing products, including coiled tubing strings and coiled line pipe.
Demand for our Stimulation & Intervention and Coiled Tubing product lines is impacted by the level of North America shale or tight sand basin hydraulic fracturing activity and the level of workover and intervention activity.
Stimulation and Intervention. We provide a broad range of high pressure pumps and flow equipment used by well stimulation, or pressure pumping, companies during stimulation, intervention (principally plug and perforation activity) and flowback processes. We sell power end assemblies, industrial heat exchanger and cooling systems, manifolds and manifold trailers, and treating iron. Frequent refurbishment and recertification of flow equipment is critical to ensuring the reliable and safe operation of a pressure pumping company’s fleet. We perform these services and position inventory in strategic locations in North America.
We also manufacture pressure control products that are used for well intervention operations that are sold domestically and internationally to oilfield service companies and equipment rental companies. Products we supply include blowout preventers for coiled tubing and wireline units and our Hydraulic Latch Assembly, which is used to facilitate efficient zipper fracturing operations. We also manufacture electro-mechanical wireline cables as well as innovative EnviroLite branded (greaseless) cables. We also conduct aftermarket refurbishment and recertification services for pressure control equipment. 
Our primary customers in the Stimulation and Intervention product line are pressure pumping, wireline and flowback service companies. In addition, we sell directly to pressure pumping unit original equipment manufacturers. 
Coiled Tubing. We manufacture Global Tubing® branded coiled tubing strings, including DURACOIL (quench and temper), and coiled line pipe, and provide related services. Coiled tubing strings are consumable components utilized to perform well completion and intervention activities. Our coiled line pipe offering serves as an alternative to conventional line pipe and composite flexibles in onshore and offshore applications.
The product line’s primary customers are domestic and international service companies that provide coiled tubing services and oil and gas operators.
Production segment
In our Production segment, we design, manufacture and supply products and provide related equipment and services to the production and infrastructure markets. Through this segment, we supply production equipment, including well site production and process equipment, and a broad range of industrial and process valves.
The segment’s primary market driver is the level of spending associated with bringing new wells on production. Demand for our Production Equipment product line is also impacted by the amount of spending on midstream and downstream projects. Demand for our Valve Solutions product line is driven by the level of infrastructure additions, upgrades and maintenance activity across the oil and natural gas industry, including the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors. In addition, Valve Solutions is affected by activity levels in the power generation, process, petrochemical and mining industries. 
Production Equipment. Our Production Equipment product line provides engineered process systems and field services for capital equipment used at the wellsite and for production processing in the U.S. Once a well has been drilled, completed and brought on stream, we provide the well operator or producer with process equipment necessary to make the oil or natural gas ready for transmission. We engineer, fabricate and install separators, packaged production systems and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME”) and American Petroleum Institute (“API”) coded pressure vessels, skidded vessels with gas measurement, modular process plants, header and manifold skids, process and flow control equipment and separators to help clean and process oil or natural gas as it travels from the wellhead and along the transmission line to the refinery. Our customers are principally U.S. oil and natural gas operators or producers.
We also design and provide process oil treatment equipment, including EDGE® and NU-STATIC® branded desalters and dehydrator technologies, used in refineries and other process applications worldwide. We have a team of highly trained technicians and field service engineers for repair and installation, and we supply a broad range of replacement parts for our equipment and other manufacturers. This equipment removes sand, water and suspended solids from hydrocarbons prior to their transmission or refining. 
Valve Solutions. We provide a wide range of industrial valves that principally serve the upstream, midstream and downstream markets of the oil and natural gas industry. To a lesser extent, our valves serve general industrial, power generation and process industry customers as well as the mining industry. We provide ball, gate, globe, check and butterfly valves across a range of sizes and applications. 
We market our valves to our customers and end users through our recognized brands: PBV®, DSI® and Accuseal®. Much of our production is sold through distribution supply companies, with our marketing efforts targeting end users for pull through of our valve products. Our global sales force and representatives cover approximately 30 countries, with local sales and distribution in Canada. Our Canadian operations provide significant exposure to heavy oil projects.
Our supply chain systems enable us to design and sell high-quality engineered valves, as well as provide standardized products, while maintaining competitive pricing and minimizing capital requirements. We utilize our international manufacturing partners to produce components and completed products for a number of our valve brands. 
Depending on the product, our valves are manufactured to conform to the standards of one or more of the API, American National Standards Institute, American Bureau of Shipping, and International Organization for Standardization and/or other relevant standards governing the design and manufacture of industrial valves. 
Business history 
Forum was incorporated in 2005 and formed through a series of acquisitions. In August 2010, Forum Oilfield Technologies, Inc. was renamed Forum Energy Technologies, Inc., when four other companies were merged into Forum. On April 17, 2012, we completed our initial public offering. 
Backlog
As we provide a mix of consumable products, capital goods, and repair parts and services, the majority of our business does not require lengthy lead times. The majority of orders and commitments included in our backlog as of December 31, 2020 were scheduled to be delivered within six months. Our backlog was approximately $114 million at December 31, 2020 and approximately $173 million at December 31, 2019. Substantially all of the projects currently in our backlog are subject to change and our customers may seek to terminate these orders. However, customers are generally required to pay us for work performed, other costs and fees as a result of such changes or termination. It is difficult to predict how much of our current backlog may be delayed or terminated, or subject to changes, as well as our ability to collect termination or change fees. 
Our consumable and repair products are predominantly off-the-shelf items requiring short lead-times, generally less than six months, and our related refurbishment or other services are also not contracted with significant lead time. The composition of our backlog is reflective of our mix of capital equipment, consumable products, aftermarket and other related items. Our bookings, which consist of written orders or commitments for our products or related services, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $473 million and $863 million, respectively. 
Customers
No customer represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any of the last three years.
Seasonality
A substantial portion of our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality. We do, however, generally experience lower sales and profitability in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in working days caused by calendar year-end holidays, and manufacturing and shipping delays caused by weather. In addition, given the geographic proximity of a number of our facilities to the Gulf Coast, we are subject to business interruptions caused by hurricanes and tropical storms. A small portion of the revenue we generate from select Canadian operations often benefits from higher first quarter activity levels, as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with a number of companies of varying size. There are several large national and multinational companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition. In addition, we have several smaller competitors who compete with us on a regional or local basis. These competitor are often times very quick to respond to new or emerging technologies and services, and changes in customer requirements. The principal competitive factors in our markets are product quality and performance, price, breadth of product offering, availability of products and services, performance, distribution capabilities, technical expertise, responsiveness to customer needs, reputation for service and intellectual property rights. We believe our products and services in each segment are at least comparable in price, quality, performance and dependability with our competitors’ offerings. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a rapid response to the needs of our customers, expert knowledge, a high level of customer service, and innovative product development initiatives. Some of our competitors expend greater amounts of money than us on formal research and engineering efforts. We believe, however, that our product development efforts are enhanced by the investment of management time that we make to improve our customer service and to work with our customers on their specific product needs and challenges.
Although we have no single competitor across all of our product lines, the companies we compete with across the greatest number of our product lines include National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Cameron International Corporation (a subsidiary of Schlumberger), Ingersoll Rand, TechnipFMC plc, Tenaris S.A., and Caterpillar, Inc.
Patents, trademarks and other intellectual property
We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and trademarks, have a number of pending patent and trademark applications and have developed a significant amount of trade secrets or other know how in the areas where we compete. Although our patents, trademarks, licenses, trade secrets and know how are material to us in the aggregate, we do not regard any single piece of intellectual property to be material to our business as a whole.
Raw materials
We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our component parts, products or raw materials, such as bearings, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. Please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We rely on relationships with key suppliers to operate and maintain our business.” 
Timely receipt of raw materials is critical to our business. However, we may not be able to continue purchasing raw materials on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. We generally try to purchase raw materials from multiple suppliers so that we are not dependent on any one supplier, but this is not always possible.
Inventory
An important consideration for many of our customers in selecting a vendor is timely availability of the product. Customers may pay a premium for earlier or immediate availability because of the cost of delays in critical operations. We stock our consumable products in regional warehouses or on consignment around the world so that these products are available for our customers when needed. This availability is especially critical for certain consumable products, causing us to carry substantial inventories for these products. For critical capital items in which demand is expected to be strong, we often build certain items before we have a firm order. Our having such goods available on short notice can be of great value to our customers. We also stock raw materials and components in order to be in a position to build products in response to market demand.
We typically offer our customers payment terms of 30 days, although during downturns in activity, customers often take 60 days or more to settle accounts. For sales into certain countries or for select customers, we might require payment upfront or credit support through a letter of credit. For longer term projects, we typically require progress payments as important milestones are reached. On average, we collect our receivables in about 60 days from shipment resulting in a substantial investment in accounts receivable. Likewise, standard terms with our vendors are 90 days. For critical items sourced from significant vendors, we have settled accounts more quickly, sometimes in exchange for early payment discounts.
Governmental regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection. In addition to environmental and worker safety regulations, we are subject to regulation by numerous other governmental regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Labor and other state, local and international bodies regulating worker rights and labor conditions. In addition, we are subject to certain requirements to contribute to retirement funds or other benefit plans and laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate restrict our ability to dismiss employees. We also operate vehicles that are subject to federal and state transportation regulations. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and if so, we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous substances and waste
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with the RCRA.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to the CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
Hydraulic fracturing
A significant percentage of our customers’ oil and natural gas production is being developed from unconventional sources, such as hydrocarbon shales. These formations require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the oil or natural gas from the rock so that it can flow through the formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate production. A number of federal agencies, including the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with shale development, including hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, various political groups and officials are requesting or have discussed implementing a ban on hydraulic fracturing, or oil & gas extraction generally, on federal lands. For more information, please read “Risk Factors-Potential legislation or regulations restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce demand for our products.”
Operating risk and insurance
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. Currently, our insurance program includes coverage for, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicles, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,400 employees. Of our total employees, approximately 1,000 were in the U.S., 150 were in the United Kingdom, 100 were in Germany, 100 were in Canada and 50 were in all other locations. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, other than in our Hamburg, Germany facility. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
