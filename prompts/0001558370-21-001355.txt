Item 1. Business
Business 
The Company
Trinseo S.A. (NYSE: TSE) is a public limited liability company (société anonyme) formed in 2010 and existing under the laws of Luxembourg. Prior to our formation, our business was wholly owned by The Dow Chemical Company, which, together with its affiliates, we refer to as “Dow,” and we refer to our predecessor business as “the Styron business.” In 2010, investment funds advised or managed by affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, LP (“Bain Capital”) acquired the Styron business and Dow Europe Holding B.V. (the “Acquisition”). During 2016, Bain Capital divested its entire ownership in the Company in a series of secondary offerings to the market. 
We are a leading global materials company and manufacturer of plastics, latex binders and synthetic rubber, including various advanced specialty products and sustainable solutions. We have leading market positions in many of the markets in which we compete. Our products are incorporated into a wide range of our customers’ products throughout the world, including products for automotive applications, tires, carpet and artificial turf backing, coated paper, specialty paper and packaging board, food packaging, appliances, medical devices, consumer electronics and construction applications, among others. We have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on us for formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find sustainable solutions for their businesses. Many of our products represent only a small portion of a finished product’s manufacturing costs, but provide critical functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to customer specifications. Therefore, we seek to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by our intellectual property portfolio, designed to enhance our customers’ product offerings. We believe these product traits result in substantial customer loyalty. 
We have significant manufacturing and production operations around the world, which allow us to serve our global customer base. As of December 31, 2020, our production facilities included 32 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 75 production units) at 24 sites across 12 countries, including the Company’s joint venture. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we operated 9 research and development (“R&D”) facilities globally, including technology and innovation development centers, which we believe are critical to our global presence and innovation capabilities. Our significant global operations also provide diversity in the end markets for our products.

Our Strategy
We believe that there are significant opportunities to improve our business and enhance our position as a leading global materials company and advanced specialty and sustainable solutions provider. The Company’s strategy is to grow margins and reduce earnings volatility through both organic investment and the pursuit of strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, targeting differentiated technologies focused on providing solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. The strategic acquisitions and investments that we pursue will have attractive risk-adjusted returns in markets and geographies that we believe have the best opportunity for growth, while also achieving cost efficiencies across our businesses. In conjunction with our pursuit of targeted growth opportunities, our strategy may also include targeted divestures of underperforming businesses or those less suitable to our portfolio. The Company’s organic growth will be developed through strategic capital investments to extend our leadership position in select market segments and by innovation that provides technological differentiation to our customers who seek our technological and development capabilities to create specialty grades, new and sustainable products, and technologically-differentiated formulations. Supporting this strategy is the Company’s Business Excellence program, first implemented in 2019, which is focused on business process optimization and increasing our operational efficiency and effectiveness.
In 2020, we continued to focus our efforts and investments in product offerings serving the following applications, which are less cyclical and offer significantly higher growth and margin potential: coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (“CASE”) applications within the Latex Binders segment and engineered materials (“Engineered Materials”) applications, including consumer electronics, medical, and thermoplastic elastomers (“TPEs”) applications. In December 2020, we announced the proposed acquisition of the polymethyl methacrylates (“PMMA”) and activated methyl methacrylates (“MMA”) businesses (together, referred to herein as the “Arkema business”) from Arkema, S.A. (“Arkema”), which we expect to further increase our margin potential and decrease earnings cyclicality. PMMA is a transparent and rigid plastic with a wide range of end uses and is an attractive adjacent chemistry which complements Trinseo’s existing offerings across several end markets including automotive, building & construction, medical and consumer electronics.
In order to support the Company’s growth strategy, we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial position with appropriate financial flexibility and liquidity. The Company employs a disciplined approach to capital allocation and deployment of cash that strives to balance the growth of our business, funding for targeted acquisitions, and continued cash generation, while providing attractive returns to our shareholders. For 2020, this included distributing a quarterly dividend to shareholders of $0.40 per share, and using $25.0 million in cash to repurchase approximately 0.8 million ordinary shares, about 2% of our ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. In conjunction with our announcement of the proposed acquisition of the Arkema business, we announced the implementation of a dividend reduction and suspension of our share repurchase program, to preserve cash for the transaction and reduce the need for additional indebtedness.
The priorities for uses of available cash include completion of the proposed acquisition of the Arkema business, the servicing of our debt, the continued return of capital to our shareholders via quarterly dividends, the funding of targeted growth initiatives, and the repurchase of our ordinary shares, when deemed appropriate. Management believes that strong cash flow generation, continued profitability, and spending discipline are critical to providing the Company with the ongoing flexibility to pursue our business strategy.
For more information regarding our strategic highlights see Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2020 Highlights.
Business Segments
Effective October 1, 2020, we realigned our reporting segments to reflect the new model under which the business will be managed and results will be reviewed by the chief executive officer, who is the Company’s chief operating decision maker. Following this change, the Company is reporting operating results for seven segments, five of which remain unchanged from the Company’s previous segmentation: Latex Binders, Synthetic Rubber, Feedstocks, Polystyrene, and Americas Styrenics. The Company’s former Performance Plastics segment, which included a variety of compounds and blends as well as the results of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (“ABS”), styrene-acrylonitrile (“SAN”), TPE, and polycarbonate (“PC”) businesses, was reorganized into two standalone reporting segments, Engineered Materials and Base Plastics. The new Engineered Materials segment includes the Company’s compounds and blends products sold into higher growth and value applications, such as consumer electronics and medical, as well as 

6



the Company’s TPE products which are sold into a variety of applications including footwear and automotive. The new Base Plastics segment contains the results of the remaining businesses, including the ABS, SAN, and PC businesses, as well as compounds and blends for automotive and other applications. This segmentation change will provide enhanced clarity to investors by placing the results of the Company’s products sold into engineered materials applications into a single reporting segment, which aligns with the Company’s strategy to focus our efforts and investments in these applications, as they tend to be less cyclical and offer significantly higher growth and margin potential. 
Refer to Note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for information regarding sales, Adjusted EBITDA, the performance metric used by management to evaluate our segments’ performance, and capital expenditures by segment, as well as sales and long-lived assets by geographic area. 
Latex Binders Segment 
Overview 
We are a global leader in styrene-butadiene latex (“SB latex”), holding a strong market position across the geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #2 position in SB latex capacity in Europe and the #1 position in capacity in North America, based on third party data. In 2020, approximately 44% of our Latex Binders segment’s sales were generated in Europe, 29% were generated in the United States, and the majority of the remaining net sales were generated in Asia. Additionally, this segment includes the results of our styrene-acrylate latex (“SA latex”) production facilities and related infrastructure in Rheinmünster, Germany. 
Products and End Uses 
We hold the #1 position for supplying latex binders for the coated paper and board market globally. SB latex is widely used as a binder for mineral pigments as it allows high coating speeds, improved smoothness, higher gloss level, opacity and water resistance that is valued in the product’s end use in advertising, magazines, and packaging board coatings.
We are also the #1 supplier of latex binders to the carpet, carpet tile and artificial turf market and offer a diverse range of products for use in residential and commercial applications. We produce SB latex, SA latex, vinylidene chloride, and butadiene-methacrylate latex products for the commercial and niche carpet markets. SB latex is also used in flooring as an adhesive for carpet and artificial turf fibers. We continue to implement new chemistries for paper coating and carpet backing applications. 
We also offer a broad range of performance latex binders products, including SB latex, SA latex, and vinylidene chloride latex for CASE applications. Net sales to CASE applications made up approximately 14% of total Latex Binders net sales in 2020, with margins of more than two times the average of products serving all applications within the segment.
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Latex Binders segment include BASF Group and Synthomer plc. In this segment we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service, and the length and depth of our relationships. This industry has seen capacity reduction and consolidation which we believe could positively impact our competitive standing.
We believe our Latex Binders segment is able to differentiate itself by offering customers value-added formulations and product development expertise. Our R&D team and Technical Services and Development (“TS&D”) team are able to use our pilot coating facility, paper fabrication and testing labs, carpet technology centers located near carpet producers, and product development and process research centers to assist customers in designing new products and enhancing their manufacturing processes. Many of our major customers rely on our dedicated R&D and TS&D teams to complement their limited in-house resources for formulation and reformulation tests and trials. We believe that this capability allows us to capture new business, strengthen our existing customer relationships and broaden our technological expertise. 
Additionally, our global manufacturing capabilities are key in serving customers cost-effectively, as latex binders are costly to ship over long distances due to their high water content. We believe that our global network of service and 

7



manufacturing facilities is highly valued by our customers. We seek to capture the value of our R&D and TS&D services and manufacturing capabilities through our pricing strategy. In 2020, we estimate that more than half of net sales in this segment related to contracts that include raw material pass-through clauses.
Seasonality
Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance, particularly in the CASE applications of our Latex Binders segment.
Synthetic Rubber Segment 
Overview 
We are a significant producer of styrene-butadiene rubber products and we have a leading European market position, providing approximately 44% of Western Europe’s SSBR capacity available for sale. While substantially all of our net sales were generated in Europe in 2020, approximately 26% of these net sales were exported to Asia, 12% to North America, and 5% to Latin America.
In December 2020, we announced our intent to explore the potential divestiture of our Synthetic Rubber business. We believe that our Synthetic Rubber business remains a valuable asset with potential for growth in the global tire market.
Products and End Uses 
Our Synthetic Rubber segment produces synthetic rubber products used in high-performance tires and technical rubber products, such as conveyor belts, hoses, seals and gaskets. We participate significantly in the European synthetic rubber industry, where tire producers focus on high-performance and ultra high-performance tires and rely heavily on their rubber suppliers. We have a broad synthetic rubber technology and product portfolio, focusing on specialty products, such as solution styrene-butadiene rubber (“SSBR”), while also producing core products, such as emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (“ESBR”). Our synthetic rubber products are extensively used in tires, with approximately 88% of our net sales from this segment in 2020 attributable to the tire market. We have strong relationships with many of the top global tire manufacturers and believe we have remained a supplier of choice as a result of our broad rubber portfolio and ability to offer technologically-differentiated product and product customization capabilities. Other applications for our synthetic rubber products include technical rubber goods.
SSBR. We sell SSBR products for high-performance and ultra high-performance tire applications. We produce both clear and oil extended SSBR through batch polymerization in our four SSBR production lines. We believe these processes provide leading and technologically-differentiated solutions to tire manufacturers.
During the last several years, we have been working closely with major tire producers around the world to develop multiple new SSBR grades, addressing key marketplace needs for improved tire fuel economy, grip, and abrasion characteristics, which we believe will lead to significant demand growth for our rubber products in Europe and around the world. Sales of advanced SSBR grades as a percentage of our total Synthetic Rubber segment have continually increased since 2013, and we expect our synthetic rubber product mix to continue to shift to more advanced SSBR grades in order to meet this shift in product demand. In 2020, SSBR represented approximately 64% of total segment net sales. Our SSBR margins are typically around three times those of our ESBR commodity grade synthetic rubber. 
Performance tires represent an especially attractive market to rubber producers because they provide substantial value to end customers. In fact, the market for performance tires is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 8% from 2020 through 2025. Tire manufacturers are expected to continually seek improvements in advanced rubber, which optimizes the combination of fuel economy and wet grip in order to meet European Union (“EU”) regulations which set minimum requirements and are being phased in through 2021. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are considering similar legislation and are also beginning to adopt the tire labeling requirements that have become mandatory in Europe. We believe our growth prospects are enhanced by increasing demand for high-performance tires, which, as a result of regulatory reforms aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the EU, Japan, and Korea, are now more commonly used by automakers as original equipment manufacturer specified tires in their vehicles.

8



ESBR. Our ESBR products are used in a wide range of applications within tire and technical rubber goods segments. Our ESBR product portfolio offers tire producers a comprehensive suite of synthetic rubber capabilities. For example, ESBR provides enhanced wet grip to tire treads and strength to the inner liner of tires, allowing the tires to be more easily processed. In 2020, ESBR represented approximately 30% of total segment net sales.
Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR. In May 2020, the Company made the determination to mothball both its nickel polybutadiene rubber (“Ni-PBR”) and neodymium polybutadiene rubber (“Nd-PBR”) production assets at our Schkopau, Germany location, which was completed in December 2020. This decision was made in furtherance of the Company’s strategy to focus efforts and increase investments in certain products that are less cyclical and offer higher growth and margin potential. Our Ni-PBR products have been sold for use in standard tires, performance tires, technical goods, and footwear. Nd-PBR is a key material in the latest generation of performance tires and has also been sold for use in industrial rubber goods and polymer modification. In 2020, Ni-PBR and Nd-PBR represented in aggregate approximately 6% of total segment net sales.
Competition and Customers 
Our principal competitors in our Synthetic Rubber segment include Asahi Kasei Corporation, JSR Corporation, Sumitomo Zeon Elastomers, ARLANXEO, Kumho Petrochemical Co., Ltd., Versalis S.p.A, LG Chem, and Synthos S.A. In our Synthetic Rubber segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer differentiated and reliable products, the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships. We maintain deep and long-standing relationships with a large number of multinational customers, including many of the top global tire manufacturers, as well as fast growing Asian tire manufacturers. Our relationships with our top customers, including with our predecessor business operated by Dow prior to the Acquisition (as defined in Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements), range from 10 to more than 20 years. In 2020, our top three customers in this segment accounted for 54% of segment net sales. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Synthetic Rubber segment.
We believe that we are a supplier of choice to our customers, given our broad rubber portfolio, including technologically-differentiated grades, and our product customization capabilities. Our R&D and TS&D teams use our broad rubber portfolio to develop differentiated specialty products for customers. Once implemented with a customer, these newly-developed specialty products cannot be easily replaced with a competitor’s product. As a result, we believe customers are likely to buy from us throughout the life cycle of specific tire models to avoid high switching costs and prevent repetition of the expensive development process.
Functionalized SSBR, which is a specialized, higher margin grade of SSBR used in high-performance and ultra high-performance tires, provides superior performance on grip, durability and rolling resistance. Trinseo is one of the largest suppliers of functionalized SSBR in Europe with a leading position in functionalization technology. Functionalized SSBR is expected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 10% from 2020 through 2025, which is nearly twice the expected rate of non-functionalized SSBR. 
Since 2018 the Company has worked to bolster its position in the SSBR market by increasing SSBR capacity and utilizing its SSBR pilot plant to allow for an expedited product development process from lab sample to commercialization, by delivering sufficient quantities of new formulations without the need to interrupt production in our industrial lines. 
While we export our rubber products worldwide, our production facilities are solely in Europe. Therefore, we may face competitive challenges with customers who would prefer local manufacturers. However our technology leadership providing customers advancement in their products prevails, supporting the traction for global sales.
While the prices of raw materials used in the production of products in this segment can fluctuate, approximately three quarters of net sales in 2020 in this segment were related to contracts that included raw material pass-through clauses.
We are also focused on supplying customers with sustainable solutions. Among other initiatives, in October 2020 we announced an agreement with Tyre Recycling Solutions on a commercial collaboration and equity investment. This agreement is aimed towards collaboration on research and development to help global tire manufacturers develop more sustainable tire formulations which are expected to reduce the manufacturing environmental footprint and create a sustainable outlet for end-of-life tires.

​
Seasonality
Due to the geographic diversity of the Company’s customers and end markets for our polystyrene products across the globe, our Polystyrene segment does not typically experience material levels of seasonality. However, sales volumes may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as customers may adjust their purchasing patterns based on their expectations of polystyrene price changes. 
Feedstocks Segment
Overview
Trinseo is a large consumer of styrene monomer globally. The primary function of our Feedstocks segment is the production of styrene monomer in Europe in order to provide secure sourcing of this key raw material to our other segments. In fact, the majority of the styrene monomer produced by our Feedstocks segment is consumed by our other segments. However, we do sell a portion of our produced styrene monomer to third parties. Overall, our Feedstocks segment supplied 15% of the European styrene monomer capacity in 2020.
Products and End Uses
Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SAN resins, SA latex, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber.

Global styrene operating rate percentages were in the high 70’s in 2020 and we believe operating rates will remain at similar levels over the next several years. The operating rate could be positively impacted by the potential closure of higher-cost styrene plants. Effective operating rates can, from time to time, be impacted by planned and unplanned outages, leading to periods of elevated margins.
Seasonality
Our Feedstocks segment does not generally experience material levels of seasonality affecting sales volumes; however, there may be seasonal fluctuations in margin as planned supply outages generally occur more often in the spring and fall seasons.
Americas Styrenics Segment
Overview 
This segment consists solely of the operations of our 50%-owned joint venture with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, Americas Styrenics LLC (“Americas Styrenics”), which continues to be a leading producer in North America of both styrene and polystyrene. In 2020, Americas Styrenics was the #1 producer of polystyrene, based on capacity data, and supplied 18% of the styrene monomer capacity in North America. We received a total of $15.0 million in cash dividends from Americas Styrenics during 2020. We estimate that the contribution to our equity earnings from Americas 

13



Styrenics’ polystyrene business was approximately 75% in 2020, 49% in 2019, and 32% in 2018. This translates to a contribution from Americas Styrenics’ polystyrene business to our Adjusted EBITDA of approximately 17% in 2020, 13% in 2019, and 8% in 2018.
Products and End Uses
Styrene monomer is a basic building block of plastics and a key input to many of the Company’s products. Styrene monomer is a key raw material for the production of polystyrene, and in 2020 approximately 55% of the styrene monomer produced by Americas Styrenics was consumed in its own production of polystyrene. The remainder of Americas Styrenics’ product is sold as a key raw material to other manufacturers of polystyrene, expandable polystyrene, SB latex, ABS resins, unsaturated polyethylene resins, and styrene-butadiene rubber. 
Americas Styrenics also produces GPPS, high heat, high impact resin, and STYRON A-TECH™ polystyrene products. Major applications for these polystyrene products include appliances, food packaging, food service disposables, consumer electronics, and building and construction materials.

Americas Styrenics’ principal competitors are INEOS Styrolution, Total S.p.A., and LyondellBasell. In our Americas Styrenics segment, we compete primarily based on our ability to offer reliable products as well as the quality of our customer service and the length and depth of our relationships.
As a leading styrenics producer in North America, this segment is well-positioned to benefit from consolidation dynamics in the styrene and polystyrene industries within the region. As noted above in the Feedstocks segment section, global styrene operating rate percentages were in the high 70’s in 2020 and we believe they will remain at similar levels over the next several years, with the potential for positive upside if there are closures of higher-cost styrene plants. Effective operating rates can, from time to time, be impacted by planned and unplanned outages, leading to periods of elevated margins. 
Seasonality
 Reporting periods impacted by the winter season and unfavorable weather conditions that typically affect the construction and building materials end markets may result in seasonally lower performance in our Americas Styrenics segment.
Our Relationship with Dow 
Following the Acquisition, we entered into certain long-term agreements with Dow to provide services that would ease our transition into a standalone company. Those agreements included the Amended and Restated MOD5 Computerized Process Control Software, Licenses and Services Agreement, with Rofan Services (“AR MOD5 Agreement”), the Second Amended and Restated Master Outsourcing Services Agreement (“SAR MOSA”), certain site and operating services agreements, and raw material supply agreements.
Under the AR MOD5 Agreement, Dow provides worldwide process control technology, including hardware, software licenses and support services, and related enterprise resource planning services. The AR MOD5 Agreement, as amended, has a term through December 2023, and may be terminated by either party for cause or uncured material breach; by Trinseo if we no longer wish to receive maintenance and support for any licensed software; or by Dow if we use the licensed software for any purposes other than Company business. Dow may terminate the maintenance and support terms at any time if we fail to make payments when due. As of December 31, 2020, we have converted over half of our plants from the MOD5 process control technology and are no longer reliant on Dow for such process control technology at those plants. We expect to convert the remainder of our plants by the end of 2023.
The SAR MOSA provided for ongoing worldwide services from Dow, in areas such as information technology, enterprise resource planning, finance, environmental health and safety, training, customer service, marketing and sales support, supply chain and certain sourcing and transactional procurement services. From 2018 through 2020, the Company worked to insource, and in some cases outsource to other vendors, certain information technology, procurement, supply chain, finance, and enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) services and systems that were being 

14



provided by Dow. By mid-2020, substantially all of the services covered under this agreement were no longer provided by Dow. During 2020, the Company incurred $24.6 million in costs related to our transition of these services away from Dow, of which $6.5 million was capitalized and $18.1 million was recognized as expense. The Company does not expect to incur any further significant costs related to transitioning services away from Dow under the SAR MOSA in 2021.
In addition, we entered into various site services agreements (“SAR SSAs”) with Dow to provide site services to the Company at Dow-owned sites. Conversely, we entered into similar agreements with Dow, where, at Company-owned sites, we provide such services to Dow. These agreements cover general services that are provided at certain facilities co-located with Dow, including utilities, site administration, environmental health and safety, site maintenance and supply chain. These agreements generally have 25-year terms and include options to renew. These agreements may be terminated at any time by agreement of the parties, or, by either party, for cause or under certain circumstances for a material breach. In addition, we may terminate with 12-months’ prior notice to Dow any services identified in any SAR SSA as “terminable.” Highly integrated services, such as electricity and steam, generally cannot be terminated prior to the termination date unless we experience a production unit shut down for which we provide Dow with 15-months’ prior notice, or upon payment of a shutdown fee. Upon expiration or termination, we would be obligated to pay a monthly fee to Dow for a period of 45 to 60 months following the expiration or termination of such SAR SSA. The agreements under which Dow receives services from us may be terminated under the same circumstances and conditions.
In addition, at the date of the Acquisition, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement pursuant to which we operate and maintain our SAN facility in Midland, Michigan to manufacture products for Dow. This agreement has a 25-year term, with automatic renewals for five-year terms unless one party gives notice at least 18 months prior to the end of the period. We may terminate any operational service under the agreement in the event that we experience a production unit shutdown, with 15-months’ prior notice to Dow. Furthermore, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement between the parties, by either party on notice that the other party fails to cure non-performance or if the other party is in material breach of a material obligation under the agreement within certain parameters, or because of either party’s insolvency.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we incurred a total of $155.4 million, $204.0 million, and $265.1 million, respectively, in expenses under the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and SAR SSAs (which include utilities), including $139.2 million, $164.2 million, and $210.8 million, respectively, for both the variable and fixed cost components of the site services agreements and $16.2 million, $39.8 million, and $54.3 million, respectively, covering all other agreements.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, purchases and other charges from Dow and its affiliated companies (excluding the SAR MOSA, AR MOD5 Agreement, and SAR SSAs) were approximately $659.5 million, $781.9 million, and $1,145.5 million, respectively. These purchases and other charges primarily relate to the purchase of raw materials for manufacturing of our products, as discussed further below. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, sales to Dow and its affiliated companies were approximately $98.4 million, $80.0 million, and $248.4 million, respectively. Amounts presented represent transactions with Dow and do not include transactions with DuPont companies, noting the entities separated in 2019.

We continue to procure certain raw materials, utilities, and site services from Dow. We are party to several agreements with Dow for the provision of certain raw materials, products and services and other operational arrangements. Dow provides a large percentage of certain raw materials used in the production of our products, under agreements that are important to our business. The failure of Dow to perform their obligations, or the termination of these agreements, could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A—Risk Factors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The prices of our key raw materials are volatile and can fluctuate significantly over time. While the predominant reason for this volatility is the impact of market imbalances in supply and demand from time to time, energy prices may also impact the volatility of some of our raw materials. The table below shows our key raw materials by reporting segment.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

We have supply contracts in place to help maintain our supply of raw materials at competitive market prices and seek to implement the most efficient and reliable raw material strategy for each of our segments, including maintaining a balance between contracted and spot purchases of raw materials. We also produce raw materials for use by our businesses, such as styrene monomer. 
In 2020, we obtained approximately 29% of our raw materials from Dow (based on aggregate purchase price). In 2020, Dow supplied us with approximately 95% of our benzene requirements and 99% of our ethylene requirements. Dow continues to be our largest supplier for these raw materials as well as a significant supplier of butadiene. In 2020, we executed new supply agreements with Dow for ethylene, benzene, and butadiene, which commence in 2021 and have contractual terms of two to five years, with renewal provisions.
While Dow provides a significant portion of our raw materials pursuant to these supply agreements, we have developed a comprehensive strategy for obtaining additional sources of supply where needed. Other supply sources in Europe include major producers with contract terms of up to five years at competitive market prices. Supply to North America and Asia are exclusively from other major third-party producers via supply contracts.
Through long-term strategic contracts and spot market purchases, we obtained 36% and 24%, respectively, of our styrene supply in 2020. Additionally, our internal production of styrene from purchased ethylene and benzene at our own manufacturing sites provided 40% of our styrene supply in 2020. With this mix of purchased and produced styrene, we seek to optimize our overall costs of securing styrene through efficient logistics, manufacturing economics and market dynamics. 
Bisphenol A (“BPA”) is the major raw material associated with PC production. Our supply of this raw material is produced by a subsidiary of Olin Corporation and is provided to us via pipeline. In 2020, we executed a three-year supply agreement with Olin Corporation with a term through December 31, 2022.
Technology 
Our R&D and TS&D activities across our segments focus on identifying needs in our customers’ end markets. As part of our customer-centric model, our R&D/TS&D organization interfaces with our sales and marketing teams and directly with customers to determine their product requirements, considering industry and market segment trends. This information is used to select R&D/TS&D projects that are value-enhancing for both our customers and Trinseo. 
Our innovation and technology centers support our technological and R&D/TS&D capabilities. In addition, our R&D/TS&D efforts are also supported by certain “mini-plants” operated by our businesses in Stade and Schkopau, Germany. These mini plants are used to make samples of experimental products for testing, which we believe is a critical step in our new product development process. We also operate a plastics research center, which integrates two existing technical support centers and research lab operations in a single location at our Terneuzen, The Netherlands office location. Further, we operate pilot plants to facilitate new production technology, including a new TPE pilot facility in 

16



Hsinchu, Taiwan where we commenced operations in December 2020. The new TPE facility will enable faster innovation cycles in close collaboration with Asia Pacific customers for sustainably advantaged materials in targeted markets including consumer electronics, medical, footwear, and automotive.
R&D and TS&D costs are included in expenses as incurred. Our R&D and TS&D costs were $60.4 million, $54.6 million, and $56.0 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
We have a customer-centric business model that has helped us to develop strong relationships with many customers. Our sales and marketing professionals are primarily located at our facilities or at virtual offices within their respective geographies. We have approximately 162 professionals working in sales and marketing around the world, along with approximately 93 customer service professionals and we sell our products to customers in approximately 80 countries. We primarily market our products through our direct sales force. Typically, our direct sales are made by our employees in the regions closest to the given customer.
Intellectual Property 
We evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to utilize patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property to protect our products and our critical investments in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. We focus on securing and maintaining patents for certain inventions, while maintaining other inventions as trade secrets, derived from our customer-centric business model, to maximize the value of our product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities. Our policy is to seek appropriate protection for significant product and process developments in the major markets where the relevant products are manufactured or sold. Patents may cover products, processes, intermediate products and product uses. Patents extend for varying periods in accordance with the date of patent application filing and the legal life of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of subject matter covered by the patent and the scope of the claims of the patent.
In most industrial countries, patent protection may be available for new substances and formulations, as well as for unique applications and production processes. However, given the geographical scope of our business and our continued growth strategy, there are regions of the world in which we do business or may do business in the future where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. We maintain strict information security policies and procedures wherever we do business. These information security policies and procedures include data encryption, controls over the disclosure and safekeeping of confidential information, as well as employee awareness training. Moreover, we monitor our competitors’ products and, if circumstances were to dictate that we do so, we would vigorously challenge the actions of others that conflict with our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
The technologies we utilize in some of our businesses have been in use for many years (e.g., SB latex and ABS) and a number of our patents relating to such technologies have expired or will expire in within the next several years. As patents expire, or are allowed to lapse, the products and processes described and claimed in those patents become generally available for use by the public. We believe that the expiration of any single patent or family of patents that is scheduled to expire in the next three years would not materially adversely affect our business or financial results. We believe that our trade secrets relating to manufacturing and other processes used in connection with products to which expiring patents relate will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage after the expiration of these patents.
We use trademarks as a means of differentiating our products. We protect our trademarks against infringement where we deem appropriate. We have successfully registered the TRINSEO™ trademark in more than 130 countries.
Dow has either transferred to us or granted perpetual, royalty-free licenses to us to use Dow’s intellectual property that was used by Dow to operate the Styron business prior to the Acquisition. This intellectual property includes certain processes, compositions and apparatus used in the manufacture of our products. In addition to our license rights to use Dow’s intellectual property related to the Styron business, we have obtained licenses to use Dow’s intellectual property to the extent necessary to perform our obligations under the contracts transferred to us in the Acquisition and to use such intellectual property (other than patents) for products outside of the Styron business as it was conducted by Dow prior to the Acquisition, subject to certain limitations. While we believe our license rights with respect to Dow’s intellectual property are sufficient to allow us to operate our current business, new growth opportunities in latex binders, and to a 

17



lesser extent plastics, involving new products may fall outside of our license rights with Dow. Therefore, our ability to develop new products may be impacted by intellectual property rights that have not been licensed to us by Dow. We have the right, with Dow’s cooperation, to directly enforce the patents that are exclusively licensed to us by Dow where infringement is primarily within the scope of our business; but nothing obligates Dow to enforce against third parties the intellectual property rights of Dow that are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis or where the infringement is primarily outside the scope of our business.
Since our formation on June 17, 2010, we have focused our product innovation across our various product lines. The intellectual property that we have created or acquired since the Acquisition is largely in these segments and covers areas such as material formulations, material process technologies and various end-use industrial applications.
Environmental, Health, Safety and Product Stewardship 
Obtaining, producing and distributing many of our products involve the use, storage, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. We are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent national and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, which address, among other things:


● | emissions to the air;
--+----------------------


● | discharges to soils and surface and subsurface waters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | other releases into the environment;
--+-------------------------------------


● | prevention, remediation or abatement of releases of hazardous materials into the indoor or outdoor environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | climate change impacts;
--+------------------------


● | process and maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | registration and evaluation of chemicals;
--+------------------------------------------


● | production, handling, labeling or use of chemicals used or produced by us;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | stewardship of products after manufacture; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | circular solutions, for polystyrene and other products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

We monitor compliance with applicable state, national, and international environmental, health and safety requirements and maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, which may in some circumstances exceed the requirements imposed by applicable law. We have a strong environmental, health and safety organization with a staff of professionals who are responsible for environmental, health, safety and product regulatory compliance and stewardship, in addition to comprehensive standards and tools. We supplement our programs with our participation in trade associations which monitor developments in legislation impacting our businesses. Additionally, our Supplier Code of Conduct includes our expectations for our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulations and encourages them to adhere to the highest principles of environmental responsibility.
We follow the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care® Guiding Principles for our global facilities and products and last received third party certification of our Responsible Care® Management System in 2019. Many of our facilities have been certified to ISO 14001 and other ISO management systems. We have a mature corporate environmental, health and safety audit program for all of our facilities. We focus on emergency preparedness and crisis planning and drills, at both the facility and corporate level. We expect that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and our industry in general.
Sustainability and Climate Change
We recognize that climate change has had and will continue to have significant impacts on our environment, particularly as it relates to extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels, and which has prompted regulations limiting, among other things, the emission of greenhouse gases. In the countries in which we operate, particularly in the EU, we are required to comply with increasingly extensive regulations to address climate change impacts and resource conservation requirements.
We track and publicly report our greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and energy consumptions and our facilities work to improve our performance at reducing chemical emissions, water usage and energy consumption. Our 

18



Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which is available on our website, provides our most recent sustainability highlights for our products, performance and operations. The report highlights sustainability goals and other initiatives to improve our sustainability performance. We do not expect the costs to comply with legislation enacted as a result of climate change and other sustainability efforts will be material to our operations and consolidated financial position in the next 12 months.
Environmental Remediation
Environmental laws and regulations require mitigation or remediation of the effects of the disposal or release of chemical substances. Under some of these regulations, as the current owner or operator of a property, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on or under the property, without regard to whether we knew of or caused the contamination, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were permitted at the time they occurred. At our Allyn’s Point, Connecticut property we lease a portion of the property to our joint venture, Americas Styrenics, for its operations, which includes a regulated hazardous waste boiler, for which potential liabilities are addressed through financial assurance mechanisms and other agreements. Many of our production sites have an extended history of industrial use, and it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of the sites and might occur or be discovered at other sites. Subject to certain monetary and temporal limitations, Dow is obligated to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to releases of hazardous material that existed at our sites prior to our separation from Dow in June 2010. The period for new claims at these sites has expired. Later-acquired sites are subject to a different limitations period. We cannot be certain that Dow will fully honor their existing indemnity obligations or that the indemnity will be sufficient to satisfy all claims that we may incur. We do not currently have any material obligations to perform environmental remediation on our properties, or for any Superfund site. Any active remedial projects on our properties which we acquired in 2010 are being performed by Dow pursuant to its indemnification obligations. We conduct comprehensive environmental due diligence for potential acquisitions to mitigate the risk of assuming obligations to conduct material levels of environmental remediation.
Government Regulation
In addition to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, our operations subject us to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. International trade laws and trade agreements, export and customs controls can limit the countries in which we can do business, or add significant cost to the import or export of our products or raw materials. Changes to or violations of these regulations could impact the costs of our goods or cause delay in shipments. Our products are also used in a variety of end-uses that have specific regulatory or consumer safety requirements such as those relating to food packaging or medical devices. Changes in these requirements could result in increased compliance costs, product recalls, or fines, which could prevent or inhibit the development and sale of our products. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which the Company conducts its business, and changes in legislation or government regulations can affect the Company’s global operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Security 
We recognize the importance of security and safety to our employees and the community. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of technology) and emergency response preparedness into integrated security plans. We have conducted information security assessments at our operating facilities worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber-attacks. Effort and resources in assessing security requirements at our manufacturing facilities will continue, as required by U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other requirements.

19



Trinseo has implemented information security solutions, resources, policies, programs, and monitoring alerts to respond to potential information security events and to maintain compliance with the increasing amount of data privacy laws and regulation.
Human Capital Resources and Objectives
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,600 employees worldwide. Nearly 69% of our personnel are located at the various manufacturing sites, research and development, pilot coating, paper fabrication and testing and technology centers. The remaining employees are located at operating centers, virtual locations or geographically dispersed marketing and sales locations. Our Midland, Michigan site is the only U.S. facility with union representation for its 55 hourly operations personnel. Employees at certain of our other locations are represented by work councils. We consider relations with our personnel and the various labor organizations to be good. There have been no labor strikes or work stoppages in these locations in recent history.
​
People Strategy
We strive to retain a talented, diverse and inclusive workforce and understand that our success requires ongoing investment in our employees. Our approach to attracting and retaining talent is our commitment to our core values of Responsible Care®, Innovation, Respect & Integrity, Accountability & Value Creation, and Commitment to Customers. As applied to our employees, these values prioritize health and safety, accountability and rewards for achievement, and treatment of all persons in our organization with respect, honesty, and dignity.
Our core values are reflected in the goals of our “People Strategy,” which is designed to support employees through Talent Management, Organizational Development, and Recognition & Rewards. Talent Management measures our ability to attract and select the right talent for the right roles, onboard new employees to improve integration, build critical capabilities, and develop leaders of the future, with a culture of collaboration among high-performing and diverse teams. Organizational Development focuses on the design of organization models to achieve our business strategies, assess employee engagement, evolve our culture and facilitate open communication. Recognition & Rewards means our efforts to manage, measure, and pay for performance; differentiate and recognize job growth with increases, promotions, and pay, annual performance awards and recognition of outstanding contributions from employees.
​
Environmental Protection and Employee Health & Safety (“EH&S”)
Focus on the safety of our employees is a critical aspect of our operations, and we strive towards achieving zero injuries, spills, or process safety incidents in our facilities every year. Our EH&S management system promotes a culture of rigorous investigation, corrective action, and continuous improvement applied over many years and has delivered a world-class set of internal safety policies, processes, and procedures. This system is designed to meet our objectives to continually reduce safety and environmental incidents and risks, maintain full regulatory compliance and optimize resources and continuously improve.
The Company has taken proactive steps to minimize the potential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our employees. These steps include, but are not limited to: (i) encouraging or requiring our employees to work from home where possible or required by local laws and regulations; (ii) instituting masking and social distancing rules in our manufacturing and office locations; (iii) providing personal protective equipment; (iv) screening protocols; (v) implementing cleaning and other measures in the workplace; and (vi) conducting training for all employees. Corporate and regional COVID-19 crisis response teams lead the implementation of our pandemic response plans and other measures in our regions and at all our facilities in accordance with local requirements and guidance from the Center of Disease Control, local health departments and other health organizations. These measures have allowed us to protect worker safety while we strive to optimize production schedules, balance staffing needs, develop contingency plans, and enable the continued safe operation of our plants and facilities. We have not announced significant layoffs or employee furloughs as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
​
Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity
We are committed to maintaining an inclusive workforce that offers a diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experience, and creating an environment in which all Trinseo employees have an equal opportunity to reach their potential and contribute fully to the success of the Company. Trinseo provides an equal employment opportunity, with a 

20



policy to recruit, hire, develop, and promote qualified applicants or employees without regard to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age or disability.
​
Talent Management and Employee Development
We provide opportunities for career development through a combination of training, coaching, and on-the-job experiences. We believe this approach to development provides our employees with the right balance of learning options. Further, we believe that early investment in our employees ensures that our future leaders have the skills they will need to be successful within a complex and ever-changing business environment. As part of our People Strategy, we conduct a talent review process that assesses our employee’s leadership behaviors, attributes, potential, and provides them with input on personal development. We also utilize a goal setting scorecard that enables employees to document and align their goals within a leadership team and across functions, which goals are set against annual Company priorities. Employees are evaluated on their performance versus individual goals and on the Company’s performance versus corporate goals (which includes financial and safety metrics). Part of the annual performance review process includes personal assessment goals which are tracked and reviewed throughout the year.
​
Compensation Policies
Trinseo’s process for determination of remuneration consists of two main components: base pay and an annual variable program, and we are committed to ensuring equitable compensation among our employees. As stated above, equal opportunity and diversity are important at Trinseo. We conduct internal reviews to assess fair treatment to determine if our pay practices are being implemented appropriately in all jurisdictions where we operate.
