The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 and results in either a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year. Our most recently completed fiscal year, fiscal 2019, ended on February 1, 2020, and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2018 ended on February 2, 2019 and consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2017 ended on February 3, 2018 and consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2020 will end on January 30, 2021 and will consist of 52 weeks. 
On December 11, 2019, the Company effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split of its common stock. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every ten shares of issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, with no change in par value per share. Accordingly, all share numbers and per share prices have been adjusted throughout this report. The reverse stock split was primarily intended to bring the company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for maintaining its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

A. General 
We are an interactive media company that manages ShopHQ, our nationally distributed shopping entertainment network, Bulldog Shopping Network and Media Services. ShopHQ programming is distributed in more than 84 million homes through cable and satellite distribution agreements, agreements with telecommunications companies and arrangements with over-the-air broadcast television stations. ShopHQ programming is also streamed live online at shophq.com, a comprehensive digital commerce platform that sells products which appear on its television shopping network as well as an extended assortment of online-only merchandise and is available on mobile channels and over-the-top ("OTT") platforms. Our programming and products are also marketed via mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, and through the leading social media channels. Our nascent, but growing Media Services offers creative and interactive advertising, OTT app services and third-party logistics. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we launched the Bulldog Shopping Network, a niche television shopping network geared towards male consumers and acquired Float Left Interactive, Inc. ("Float Left") and J.W. Hulme Company ("J.W. Hulme"). 
Interactive Video and Digital Commerce Retailing 
The primary distribution platform of our interactive video and digital commerce retail business is our 24-hour television shopping network, ShopHQ, which is the third largest television shopping network in the United States. Our comprehensive online ShopHQ website complements our network with a combination of products featured on TV as well as a strong collection of online-only products. Consolidated net sales, including shipping and handling revenues, totaled $501.8 million, $596.6 million and $648.2 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. We offer several convenient methods for a customer to purchase items, including our toll-free telephone number, directly online, or using mobile devices. Our television programming is primarily produced at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota headquarters facility. We also produce programming remotely on-location during special events. The programming is transmitted nationally via satellite to cable system operators, direct-to-home satellite providers, broadcast television station operators and OTT platforms.
ShopHQ Products and Product Mix 
Products sold on our digital commerce platforms include jewelry & watches; home & consumer electronics; beauty & wellness; and fashion & accessories. Historically, jewelry & watches has been our largest merchandise category. While changes in our product mix have occurred as a result of customer demand and other factors including our efforts to diversify our offerings within our major merchandise categories, jewelry & watches remained our largest merchandise category in fiscal 2019. We are focused on diversifying our merchandise assortment within our existing product categories as well as by offering potential new product categories, including proprietary, exclusive and name-brands in an effort to increase revenues, gross profits and to grow our new and active customer base. The following table shows our ShopHQ segment merchandise mix as a percentage of total digital commerce net merchandise sales for the years indicated by product category group. We have recast certain fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 product category percentages in the accompanying table to conform to our new segment structure. 
 4


Net Merchandise Sales by Category | Fiscal 2019 | Fiscal 2018 | Fiscal 2017
Jewelry & Watches | 44% | 38% | 38% 
Home & Consumer Electronics | 23% | 25% | 26% 
Beauty & Wellness | 18% | 19% | 17% 
Fashion & Accessories | 15% | 18% | 19% 

Jewelry & Watches.  We feature a broad assortment of jewelry from fine to fashion, silver to gold, genuine gemstones to simulated diamonds. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of men’s and women’s watches from classic to modern designs.
Home & Consumer Electronics.  We feature home décor, cookware, kitchen electrics, tabletop accessories and home furnishings. Our consumer electronics category offers current technology trends and solutions from some of the world's most recognized brands.
Beauty & Wellness.  Our assortment features a variety of skincare, cosmetics, hair care and bath & body products in addition to supplements and light fitness equipment. 
Fashion & Accessories.  We offer fashionable looks that strike a balance between current trends and essentials with an assortment of apparel, outerwear, intimates, handbags, accessories and footwear.
Emerging Businesses
During fiscal 2019 we acquired J.W. Hulme and Float Left. J.W. Hulme is a an iconic, 114-year-old American brand offering artisan-crafted accessories and apparel via e-commerce, catalogs and one flagship retail store in St. Paul, Minnesota. Float Left is a leading technology provider delivering Over-The-Top (OTT) content and TV-everywhere solutions to media companies seeking to reach audiences through the OTT and smart TV distribution models. Media Services provides creative, interactive services and third-party logistics services to consumer product companies. Bulldog Shopping Network is a niche television shopping network geared towards male consumers. 
B. Company Strategy 
iMedia is a leading interactive media company managing a growing portfolio of niche television networks, niche national advertisers and media services. Our strategy includes developing and growing multiple monetization models, including TV retailing, e-commerce, advertising and service fees, to grow our business. We expect that these initiatives build upon our core strengths and provide us an advantage in the marketplace. On July 16, 2019 we changed our corporate name to iMedia Brands, Inc. to reflect our broader portfolio of media brands. 
Our strategy includes offering our curated assortment of proprietary, exclusive (i.e., products that are not readily available elsewhere), emerging and name-brand products. Our programming is distributed through our video commerce infrastructure, which includes television access to more than 84 million homes in the United States, primarily on cable and satellite systems as well as over-the-air broadcast and OTT platforms. Our merchandising plan is focused on delivering a balanced assortment of profitable products presented in an engaging, entertaining, shopping-centric format using our unique expertise in storytelling and “live on location” broadcasting. We are also focused on growing our high lifetime value customer file and growing our revenues, through social, mobile, online, and OTT platforms, as well as leveraging our capacity, system capability and expertise in distribution and product development to generate new business relationships. We believe these initiatives will position us to deliver a more engaging and enjoyable customer experience with product offerings and service that exceed customer expectations. On August 21, 2019, we changed the name of the Evine network back to ShopHQ, which was the name of the network in 2014. ShopHQ is easier to recognize for existing television retailing customers and we believe this more intuitive and recognizable name will allow us to better promote our network and build our customer file.
Our growth strategy also includes building profitable niche interactive media networks and services, such as the Bulldog Shopping Network, which launched in November 2019, and LaVenta. The Bulldog Shopping Network is a new omni-channel, television shopping brand that sells and advertises men's merchandise and services, and the aspirational lifestyles associated with its brands and personalities. In addition, in 2021, we expect to launch LaVenta, a new omni-channel, Spanish language, television shopping brand centered on the Latin culture to sell and advertise merchandise, services and personalities, celebrating aspirational lifestyles. To grow our service revenue, we recently launched Media Services, which includes creative and interactive services and third-party logistics services. We plan to expand our service offerings to provide a “one-stop commerce services offering” targeting brands interested in propelling their growth using our unique combination of assets in television, web and third-party logistics services. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we acquired two businesses, J.W. Hulme and Float Left. J.W. Hulme is a business specializing in artisan-crafted leather products, including handbags and luggage. We plan to accelerate J.W. Hulme's revenue growth by creating its own programming on ShopHQ and utilize J.W. Hulme to craft private-label accessories for the 
 5

Company's existing owned and operated fashion brands. Float Left is a business comprised of connected TVs, video-based content, application development and distribution, including technical consulting services, software development and maintenance related to video distribution. We plan to utilize Float Left’s team and technology platform to further grow our content delivery capabilities in OTT platforms while providing new revenue opportunities.
C. Television Program Distribution and Online Operations
Our television programming continues to be the most significant medium through which we reach our customers, and we believe that our television shopping programs are a key driver of traffic to our ShopHQ website and mobile platforms. Our online business represents an important component of our future growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in and enhance our online-based capabilities and mobile presence. Our digital sales penetration, or, the percentage of net sales that are generated from our ShopHQ website and mobile platforms, which are primarily ordered directly online, was 52.8%, 53.1% and 51.9% in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. Our mobile penetration increased to 57.3%, 54.0% and 49.9% of total online sales during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. 
Television Shopping Network
Satellite Delivery of Programming.  Our television programming is presently distributed via a communications satellite transponder to cable systems and direct-to-home satellite providers. We have a satellite lease agreement with our present provider of satellite services. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we distribute our television programming via a satellite that was launched in August 2005 and is currently set to expire in October 2020. The agreement provides us, under certain circumstances, with preemptible back-up services if satellite transmission is interrupted.
Television Distribution.  We generally operate under distribution agreements with cable operators, direct-to-home satellite providers and telecommunications companies to distribute our television programming over their systems. The terms of the distribution agreements typically range from one to five years. During any fiscal year, certain agreements with cable, satellite or other distributors may or have expired. We are currently negotiating a number of agreements to lower our costs, including a significant agreement which expired in fiscal 2019 and is currently month-to-month. Under certain circumstances, we or our distributors may cancel the agreements prior to their expiration. The distribution agreements generally provide that we will pay each operator a monthly access fee, based on the number of homes receiving our programming, and in some cases marketing support payments. We frequently review distribution opportunities with cable system operators and broadcast stations providing for full- or part-time carriage of our programming.
During fiscal 2019, there were approximately 126 million homes in the United States with at least one television set. Of those homes, there were approximately 49 million cable television subscribers, approximately 26 million direct-to-home satellite subscribers and approximately 10 million homes which receive programming through telecommunications companies, such as AT&T and Verizon. 
Our 24-hour television shopping network, ShopHQ, which is distributed primarily on cable and satellite systems, reached more than 84 million homes, or full time equivalent subscribers (“FTEs”), during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. 
Online Presence 
Our ShopHQ website as well as our mobile platform, provide customers with a shop anytime, anywhere experience and offer a broad array of consumer merchandise, including all products featured on our television programming as well as merchandise found only on our ShopHQ website. The ShopHQ website includes additional resources, including a live stream of our television programming, an archive of segments of recent past programming, videos of many individual products that the customer can view on demand, an online program guide, customer-generated product reviews as well as information about our show hosts and guest personalities. The FCC has required that all full-length television programming redistributed over the internet is captioned, and also requires captioning of programming segments distributed over the internet that were shown on television with closed captions. We currently provide closed captioning on full-length programming redistributed over the internet and other programming segments as required by FCC rules. 
Our e-commerce activities are subject to a number of general business regulations and laws regarding taxation and online commerce. There have been continuing efforts to increase the legal and regulatory obligations and restrictions on companies conducting commerce through the internet, primarily in the areas of taxation, consumer privacy and protection of consumer personal information. A number of states impose data security requirements on companies that collect certain types of information concerning their residents and other states may adopt similar requirements in the future. A patchwork of state laws imposing differing security requirements depending on the residence of our customers could impose added compliance costs.
 6

We have historically collected sales tax from customers in states where we have physical presence under the principles laid out under the 1992 United States Supreme Court decision in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota and subsequent related state statutes and regulations. We have continually monitored our physical presence activities, and have historically registered to collect sales tax in multiple states and localities as physical activities have expanded. On June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in the South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al, which overturned the Quill Corp. v. North Dakota physical presence standard and allows state and local taxing jurisdictions to impose sales tax collection responsibilities on remote sellers like the Company based solely on making a minimum level of sales into the state. We are monitoring state legislation activities in the wake of South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al that would require us to register to collect sales tax in additional state and local taxing jurisdictions and have complied with new state sales tax legislation as enacted to date. 
There are a number of federal laws that limit our ability to pursue certain direct marketing activities, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act. The statutes govern when and how we may contact consumers through various communication methods, including email, phone calls, faxes and texts, in some cases requiring consent and in others allowing a consumer to opt out of certain communications. These types of regulation may limit our ability to pursue certain direct marketing activities, thus potentially limiting our sales and number of customers.
Changes in consumer protection laws also may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. The adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business through the internet.
In addition, since our ShopHQ website is available over the internet in all states, various states may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in such state, a requirement that could result in fees and taxes as well as penalties for the failure to comply. Any new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business in this area.
D. Marketing and Merchandising 
Television and Online Retailing
Our revenues are generated from sales of merchandise offered through our interactive digital platforms, which includes cable and satellite television, our ShopHQ website, mobile devices, social media channels and OTT platforms. Our television shopping business utilizes live and selected taped television programming 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to create an interactive, entertaining, and engaging experience that brings our merchandise to life through demonstration. Our product strategy is to continue to develop and expand new product offerings across multiple merchandise categories based on customer demand, as well as to offer competitive pricing and special values in order to drive new customers and maximize margin dollars per minute. Our core digital commerce customers – those who interact with our network and transact through television, online and mobile devices – are primarily women between the ages of 45 and 70. We also have a strong presence of male customers of a similar age range. We believe our customers make purchases based on our unique products, quality merchandise and value. We develop our programming schedule with product categories that appeal to specific viewer and customer profiles targeting days of week and times of day they are most likely to be viewing our network. We feature announced and unannounced promotions to drive interest and incremental sales, including "Today’s Top Value," a sales promotion that features a special offer every day. In addition, we also feature major and special promotional events and inventory-clearance sales during different times of the year.
We continually introduce new products that are easily accessible to customers via our television, online and mobile platforms. Inventory sources include manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and importers. We intend to continue to develop and promote proprietary brands and exclusive products, which generally have higher margins than widely sold merchandise, across multiple product categories.
ShopHQ Private Label Consumer Credit Card Program
 We have a private label consumer credit card program (the "Program"). The Program is made available to all qualified consumers to finance ShopHQ purchases and provides benefits including instant purchase credits, free or reduced shipping promotions throughout the year and promotional low-interest financing on qualifying purchases. We believe use of the ShopHQ credit card furthers customer loyalty. We also believe that the card reduces total credit card expense and reduces the Company’s overall bad debt exposure since Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"), the issuing bank for the program, bears the risk of non-payment on ShopHQ credit card transactions except those in our ValuePay installment payment program. In 2017, we extended the Program through December 2020 by entering into a Private Label Consumer Credit Card Program Agreement Amendment 
 7

with Synchrony. Approximately 21% of our customer purchases were paid for using our private label consumer credit card during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Purchasing Terms 
We obtain products for our interactive digital commerce businesses from domestic and foreign manufacturers and/or their suppliers and are often able to make purchases on more favorable terms due to the volume of products purchased or sold. Some of our purchasing arrangements with our vendors include inventory terms that allow for return privileges for a portion of the order or stock balancing. In January 2020, we extended our standard payment terms with our merchandise vendors to improve our working capital and align with other large national retailers. We generally do not have long-term commitments with our vendors, and a variety of sources are available for each category of merchandise sold. During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, products purchased from one vendor accounted for approximately 19%, 14% and 15% of our consolidated net sales. We believe that we could find alternative products for this vendor’s merchandise assortment if this vendor ceased supplying merchandise; however, the unanticipated loss of any large supplier could negatively impact our sales and earnings.
E. Order Entry, Fulfillment and Customer Service
Our products are available for purchase via toll-free telephone numbers, on our ShopHQ website and through mobile platforms. We maintain agreements with third party service providers to support us with volume peaks in demand for telephone order-entry operators and automated order-processing services to take customer orders. We receive orders with our own home-based phone agents, agents at our Bowling Green, Kentucky distribution center, and at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota corporate headquarters. 
We own an approximately 600,000 square foot distribution facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky, used primarily for the fulfillment of customer orders for merchandise purchased and sold by us and for certain call center operations. 
The majority of customer purchases are paid for by credit or debit cards, including our private label credit card discussed above. Purchases and installment charges made with the iMedia private label credit card are non-recourse to us, however, we still maintain credit collection risk from the potential inability to collect future ValuePay installments. Our ValuePay program is an interest-free installment payment program which allows customers to pay by credit card for certain merchandise in two or more equal monthly installments. The percentage of our net sales in which our customers utilized our ValuePay payment program over the past three fiscal years ranged from 63% to 70%. We intend to continue to sell merchandise using the ValuePay program due to its significant promotional value. 
We maintain a product inventory, which consists primarily of consumer merchandise held for resale. The product inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. As of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, we had inventory balances of $78.9 million and $65.3 million. We do not have any material amounts of backlog orders.
Merchandise is shipped to customers by UPS, the United States Postal Service, Federal Express or other recognized carriers. We also have arrangements with certain vendors who drop-ship merchandise directly to our customers after an approved customer order is processed.
We perform our customer service functions primarily at our Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Bowling Green, Kentucky facilities, as well as with our own home-based phone agents.
Our standard return policy allows a 30-day refund period from the date of customer receipt for all customer purchases. Our return rate averaged approximately 19% in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. We continue to monitor our return rates in an effort to keep our overall return rates in line and commensurate with our current product sales mix and our average selling price levels. 
F. Competition 
The video and digital commerce retail business is highly competitive, and we are in direct competition with numerous retailers, including online retailers, many of whom are larger, better financed and have a broader customer base than we do. In our television shopping and digital commerce operations, we compete for customers with other television shopping and e-commerce retailers, infomercial companies, other types of consumer retail businesses, including traditional "brick and mortar" department stores, discount stores, warehouse stores and specialty stores; catalog and mail order retailers and other direct sellers.
Our direct competitors within the television shopping industry include, among others, QVC, Inc. and HSN, Inc., which are owned by Qurate Retail Inc. Both QVC, Inc. and HSN, Inc. are substantially larger than we are in terms of annual revenues and customers, and the programming of each is carried more broadly to U.S. households, including high definition bands and multi-
 8

channel carriage, than our programming. Multimedia Commerce Group, Inc., which operates Jewelry Television, also competes with us for customers in the jewelry category. In addition, there are a number of smaller niche retailers and startups in the television shopping arena who compete with us. We believe that our major competitors incur cable and satellite distribution fees representing a significantly lower percentage of their sales attributable to their television programming than we do, and that their fee arrangements are substantially on a commission basis (in some cases with minimum guarantees) rather than on the predominantly fixed-cost basis that we currently have. At our current sales level, our distribution costs as a percentage of total consolidated net sales are higher than those of our competition. However, we have the ability to leverage this fixed expense with sales growth to accelerate improvement in our profitability.
We anticipate continued competition for viewers and customers, for experienced television commerce and e-commerce personnel, for distribution agreements with cable and satellite systems and for vendors and suppliers - not only from television shopping companies, but also from other companies that seek to enter the television shopping and online retail industries, including telecommunications and cable companies, television networks, and other established retailers. We believe that our ability to be successful in the video and digital commerce industry will be dependent on a number of key factors, including continuing to expand our digital footprint to meet our customers' needs, increasing the lifetime value of our customer base by a combination of growing the number of customers who purchase products from us and maximizing the dollar value of sales and profitability per customer.
G. Federal Regulation 
The cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC. The following does not purport to be a complete summary of all of the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended ("Communications Act"), the Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 ("Cable Act"), the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Telecommunications Act"), or other laws and FCC rules or policies that may affect our operations. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before, are being considered by, and may in the future be considered by, Congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time. We cannot predict the effect of any existing or proposed federal legislation, regulations or policies on our business.
Cable Television
The cable industry is regulated by the FCC under the Cable Act and FCC regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by state or local governments with respect to certain franchising matters. The FCC regulates the terms of cable programming networks that are distributed by satellite, as ours is. Those regulations require, among other things, that programming channels be provided to all competing multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”). FCC rules also require that all video programming distributed over MVPDs include captioning for the hearing-impaired, and that all programs that were originally produced to be viewed over MVPD facilities include captions if they are subsequently distributed over the internet.
Product Marketing
We offer our customers a broad range of merchandise through television, online and mobile. The manner in which we promote and sell our merchandise, including claims and representations made in connection with these efforts, is regulated by a wide variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures. Some examples of these that affect the manner in which we sell and promote merchandise or otherwise operate our businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | The Food and Drug Administration’s regulations regarding marketing claims that can be made about cosmetic beauty products and over-the-counter drugs, which include products for treating acne or medical products, and claims that can be made about food products and dietary supplements;


• | The Federal Trade Commission’s regulations requiring that marketing claims across all product and service categories are truthful, not misleading, and substantiated, as well as its related regulations requiring disclosures concerning the seller’s material connections with or compensation to endorsers and influencers;


• | Regulations related to product safety issues and product recalls including, but not limited to, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substance Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to these acts; and


• | Laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about our customers.

These laws, regulations, rules, policies and procedures are subject to change at any time. Unfavorable changes applicable to us could decrease demand for merchandise offered by us, increase costs which we may not be able to offset, subject us to additional liabilities and/or otherwise adversely affect our businesses. 
 9

H. Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets and proprietary technologies, as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property protections and on confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, vendors, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. domain names, trademarks and service marks. Our registered trademarks and service marks are presumed valid in the United States, as long as they are in use, their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks and service marks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use.
I. Seasonality and Economic Sensitivity 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with the highest sales activity normally occurring during our fourth fiscal quarter of the year, namely November through January. Our business is also sensitive to general economic conditions and business conditions affecting consumer spending including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our television audience (and therefore sales revenue) can be significantly impacted by major world or domestic television-covering events which attract viewership and divert audience attention away from our programming.
J. Employees
At February 1, 2020, we had approximately 990 employees, the majority of whom are employed in customer service, order fulfillment and television production. Approximately 13% of our employees work part-time. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with respect to our employees. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we eliminated approximately 300 positions as a result of and to prepare for the potential financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

L. Segments and Geographic Information 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed our reportable segments into two reporting segments: “ShopHQ” and “Emerging.” In light of recent strategic shifts in our emerging businesses, our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, began reviewing operating results of the Emerging segment separately from our core business, ShopHQ. The chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations. All of our sales are to customers residing in the United States. Additional segment and geographic information required herein is contained in Note 10 - "Business Segments and Sales by Product Group" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have recast our segment results for all periods presented to conform to our new segment structure. 
ShopHQ 
The ShopHQ segment encompasses our nationally distributed shopping entertainment network. ShopHQ sells and distributes its products to consumers through its video commerce television, online website and mobile platforms. 
Emerging Businesses
The Emerging segment consists of our developing business models. This segment includes Media Services, which includes creative and interactive services and third-party logistics services. The Emerging segment also encompasses the Bulldog Shopping Network, and recently acquired businesses, J.W. Hulme and Float Left. Bulldog Shopping Network is a niche television shopping network geared towards male consumers. J.W. Hulme is a business specializing in artisan-crafted leather products, including handbags and luggage. J.W.

Our goal is to maintain the investor relations website as a way for investors to easily find information about us, including press releases, announcements of investor conferences, investor and analyst presentations and corporate governance. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding us and other companies that file materials with the SEC electronically.
