ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview
Kontoor Brands, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "Kontoor," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is a global lifestyle apparel company, with a portfolio led by two of the world’s most iconic consumer brands: Wrangler® and Lee®. We completed a spin-off transaction from VF Corporation ("VF" or "former parent") on May 22, 2019 (the "Separation") and began to trade as a standalone public company (NYSE: KTB) on May 23, 2019.
The Company designs, manufactures, procures, markets and distributes lifestyle apparel products. Our business is founded upon a strategic sourcing model and best-in-class supply chain, with industry-leading sustainability standards. We are focused on leveraging our global platform to drive brand growth and deliver long-term value for our stakeholders, including our consumers, customers, shareholders and suppliers.
Kontoor is headquartered in the United States ("U.S.") with a presence in over 60 countries. Our primary brands, Wrangler® and Lee®, benefit from heritages spanning over 200 combined years and together with our other brands accounted for approximately 140 million units of apparel sold in 2020. We sell our products primarily through our established wholesale and expanding digital ecosystems, supplemented through our branded brick & mortar locations. We benefit from strong relationships with many of our customers who we believe depend on our ability to reliably and timely replenish our high-volume products.
Within the U.S., our products are sold through mass merchants, specialty stores, mid-tier and traditional department stores, company-operated stores and online. Outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and Europe, our products are sold through department, specialty, company-operated, concession retail and independently operated partnership stores and online.

We focus on continuously improving the most important elements of our products, which include fit, fabric, finish and overall construction, while continuing to provide our products to consumers at attractive price points. We leverage innovation and design advancements as well as our unique brand heritages to create products that meet our consumers' needs.
The Company operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. For presentation purposes herein, all references to periods ended December 2020, December 2019 and December 2018 correspond to the 53-week fiscal period ended January 2, 2021 and the 52-week fiscal periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. 
Impact of COVID-19
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has resulted in a global economic slowdown which had a meaningful negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations during 2020. During the initial shutdowns that peaked globally in the second quarter of 2020, we temporarily closed almost all of our Company-operated stores. Although virtually all of those stores have since reopened, we have had periodic reclosures or reductions in operating hours at stores in regions impacted by subsequent resurgences of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe. While many of our largest retail partners remained open throughout the pandemic, a number of our customers experienced temporary closures or reduced traffic in their retail stores for various periods throughout the year.
Our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees and consumers. Actions taken to date include enacting global travel restrictions for all employees, enabling remote-work flexibility, implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols in all facilities, and closing of facilities, as appropriate. The Company’s offices have reopened where permitted by local restrictions and deemed appropriate by management, but many associates continue to work remotely. Although there have been limited disruptions in operations at various times during the year, the Company’s manufacturing plants and distribution centers around the world are operating and fulfilling wholesale and direct-to-consumer orders. We continue to implement and monitor safety protocols and health and wellness precautions as we reopen and operate our facilities. 
While the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, the Company continues to take the necessary, proactive steps to accommodate a prolonged COVID-19 operating environment.

Our Competitive Strengths
•Iconic Brands with Significant Global Scale.
The Wrangler® and Lee® brands are steeped in rich heritage and authenticity and have an established global presence in the apparel market. Products bearing our brands are sold in more than 60 countries, and we believe they have strong consumer connectivity worldwide. We market our brands and products to highlight their differentiated position and product attributes. We strive to maximize our consumer reach by leveraging each brand’s “best practices” to drive growth across product categories and expand our overall net revenues and earnings profile. 
•Deep Relationships with Leading Global Brick & Mortar and E-Commerce Retailers
We have developed long-term relationships with many leading global brick & mortar and e-commerce retailers, whom we believe rely on our iconic brands, leading product quality and value, and innovation to address evolving consumer needs in our product categories. By fostering these relationships, we have become an important vendor for many of our customers and have built leading category positions, which in turn supports the availability of our brands to consumers and our ability to introduce new products and categories. We also endeavor to provide sophisticated logistics, planning, and merchandising expertise to support our customers, which we believe enables a level of insight that builds more integrated customer relationships. 
•Integrated Supply Chain Built to Support Volume and Replenishment
We are continually refining our supply chain to maximize efficiency and reinforce our reputation of reliability with our customers. Through our vertically integrated supply chain we manufacture, source and distribute a significant quantity of high-volume apparel products that are frequently replenished by our retail partners. Our product procurement and distribution strategies, combined with our internal manufacturing facilities and retail floor space management programs, create increased operating flexibility. Our supply chain is built to support large volumes and to meet customer needs while balancing cost and operational requirements. Our internal manufacturing facilities are all located in the Western Hemisphere where their proximity to our primary markets enables us to deliver inventory in a consistent and timely manner. We also have established global third-party sourcing and distribution networks that we leverage across product categories and various regions. We believe our flexible and balanced approach to manufacturing and distribution allows us to better manage our production needs.

•Highly Experienced Management Team and Board of Directors
We have assembled a senior management team that is highly focused on growing our brands’ net revenues, delivering strong and consistent financial results, and building a cohesive corporate culture. Together, our management team has over 50 years of combined experience in the apparel and accessories industry and brings deep global industry expertise to the Company. Additionally, the Kontoor management team was assembled with the Separation and has been working together to stand up and operate the Company for over two years. We believe the depth of experience and deep industry knowledge of our management team and Board of Directors will continue to drive the success of our company.
•Resilient Business Model That Delivers Consistent Results
Although COVID-19 had a meaningful negative impact on our financial condition, our business has historically generated consistent margins and strong cash flows due to our global reach, leading market positions, deep customer relationships, and the vertical integration of our supply chain. We believe we offer high product value and quality to our consumers, who respond to our value proposition by consistently purchasing our products over time. Our strong margin profile combined with our diligent approach to operational excellence and capital management have produced meaningful cash flows. We believe our consistent financial results will provide us with the opportunity to consistently invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and repay debt.
Our Strategies
Our management team continues to focus on the strategies we introduced during 2019. While the impacts of COVID-19 are undeniable, we believe our focus on our strategies and underlying fundamentals has positioned us well for the future.
•Scaling our advantage in our core denim business
Our centralized senior management team with global responsibility continues to work closely with our regional teams to deliver a unified brand and product design experience while ensuring market-specific nuances are maintained. Through this integrated platform and management structure, we are focused on continuing to amplify the global strength of our brands, improve operating efficiency and increase the overall demand for our products. We continue to partner with leading retailers to launch product programs to enhance our wholesale business, drive momentum in our Western business with key retail partners and lead initiatives with the consumer in mind.
•Accelerating digital and positions in high-value segments, channels and geographies
We continue to pursue opportunities to expand the distribution of our products with new and existing e-commerce and brick & mortar customers internationally and in the U.S. In December 2020, we digitally launched our Wrangler® brand in China and have plans to expand this collection and our marketing efforts in 2021. In Europe, we intend to refine our strategy to become more consumer-centric in addressing how and where our customers want to purchase our products, beginning with our new e-commerce sites launched in 2020. In the U.S., we see an opportunity to continue to grow with our major retail customers. We also expect to leverage our leading brand positions to increase our penetration with major global e-commerce players as well as with our own websites, as we continue to evolve our digital ecosystem with advanced data analytics capabilities and unlocking new value through our global ERP infrastructure. We made progress towards these strategies during 2020 by exiting select underperforming channels, markets and points of distribution.
•Building advantaged positions to reach new consumers
We continue to enhance our existing product assortment, broaden our product offering and expand into adjacent product categories. We leverage our global innovation network to develop cognitive, design, textile and product construction advancements that target the needs of our existing and potential new target consumer groups. We strive to create new products to attract a wide range of consumers, including women and younger generations such as Body OptixTM and Extreme Motion MVP for Lee®, while seeking to ensure our core offering continues to serve the needs of our consumers. We are also pursuing new categories such as outdoor, including the launch of our new Wrangler® outdoor collection, All Terrain GearTM, and accelerating existing categories such as workwear that utilize our existing brand and product strengths. We have also introduced higher-end products at premium price points in the U.S and are collaborating with new brands. Successful execution of our product expansion strategies should broaden the appeal of our brands and products to new consumers, extend our reach into new product categories and ultimately drive the overall net revenues of our business.
•Driving an unwavering focus on expanding margins and improving capital efficiency
We expect to realize efficiencies across our business as we continue to drive benefits from a more centralized global organization and pursue cost savings initiatives. As part of our centralized approach to our global business, our management team provides global oversight for their respective business functions, including supply chain, digital and strategy, while seeking to maintain our worldwide presence and regional relevance. Focusing on our near- to medium-term business strategy, we continue to optimize our business and accelerate our performance in fundamental areas, including margin expansion and cash flow generation. Our primary areas of financial focus during 2021 will be to (i) continue aggressive pay-down of debt; (ii) provide for a superior dividend payout; and (iii) implement technology solutions to enable global efficiency, including the Company's global enterprise resource planning ("ERP") implementation and information technology infrastructure build-out.

•Strengthening our Culture to Drive our Strategies Forward
We believe there is an opportunity to create value by aligning total shareholder return with the way we attract, engage, educate and reward our employees, as well as the ways we employ sustainable business practices and engage with the communities in which we do business. We have designed inclusion and diversity goals to reshape our workforce as we believe this is key to driving innovation, and a results-oriented culture. Our strategy also includes pursuit of sustainable business activities in areas of water, waste and cotton. We are committed to corporate social responsibility, as we believe it not only is the right thing to do, but also provides an opportunity to create value for our stakeholders through an actively engaged workforce, deeper consumer engagement and potential cost savings. 
Our Business Segment Information 
Our two reportable segments are Wrangler and Lee, which primarily include sales of branded products, along with various sub-brands and collections as discussed under each brand below. In addition, we present an Other category for purposes of reconciliation of reportable segment net revenues and profits to the Company's consolidated operating results, but the Other category is not considered a reportable segment. See below for additional information on the brands, channels of distribution and geographies included in each segment.

•Other
Other includes sales of third-party branded merchandise at VF Outlet™ stores, sales and licensing of Rock & Republic® branded apparel, and sales of products manufactured for third-parties. Rock & Republic® is a premium apparel brand and is marketed to consumers as a modern and active lifestyle brand. Rock & Republic® products have historically been sold in the U.S. through an exclusive domestic wholesale distribution and licensing agreement, which expired in early 2020. We are now distributing the brand both in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our retail and e-commerce relationships. During 2020, as discussed within the Branded Direct-to-Consumer section below, we decided to discontinue the sale of third-party branded merchandise in all VF Outlet™ stores in conjunction with our decision to exit certain of those stores. Sales of Wrangler® and Lee® branded products at VF Outlet™ stores are not included in Other and are reported in the respective segments discussed above.

Prior to 2020, the Other category also included transactions with VF for pre-Separation activities, none of which continued in 2020. These transactions included sales of VF-branded products at VF Outlet™ stores, as well as sales to VF for products manufactured in our plants, use of our transportation fleet and fulfillment of a transition services agreement related to VF’s sale of its Nautica® brand business in mid-2018.

Distribution Channels and Customers
Our distribution channels include U.S. Wholesale, Non-U.S. Wholesale, Branded Direct-to-Consumer and Other.
•U.S. Wholesale
The U.S. Wholesale channel is our largest distribution channel and accounted for approximately 68% of our net revenues in 2020. Within this channel, our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are marketed and sold by mass and mid-tier retailers, specialty stores including western specialty retail, department stores, and retailer-owned and third-party e-commerce sites. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in the U.S. A portion of our U.S. Wholesale net revenue is attributable to digital sales from our wholesale partners’ websites, third-party e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, and other pure-play digital retailers. Third-party e-commerce platforms and pure-play digital retailers are a growing and important portion of this channel.
Our mass merchant customers include national retailers such as Target and Walmart, as well as various regional retail partners. Our mid-tier and traditional department store customers include national retailers such as Kohl’s and Nordstrom as well as other retail partners. The specialty store channel, which includes revenue from Wrangler® Riggs Workwear® and Wrangler® Western branded products, consists primarily of national accounts such as Boot Barn and Tractor Supply Company as well as upscale modern specialty stores.
We foster close and longstanding relationships with our wholesale customers, having partnered with each of our top three brick & mortar wholesale customers for over 25 years. In addition, we engage in an active dialogue with many of our key wholesale customers and receive proprietary insights about how our products are performing on a timely basis. Our brands’ top U.S. Wholesale customers include Amazon, Kohl’s, Target and Walmart. Sales to Walmart were approximately 38% in 2020, 34% in 2019 and 32% in 2018.
In addition, a small portion of sales in our U.S. Wholesale channel are from domestic licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Non-U.S. Wholesale
The Non-U.S. Wholesale channel represents the majority of our international business and accounted for approximately 17% of our net revenues in 2020. The majority of the Wrangler® and Lee® international product business is located in Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"), where we sell our products through department stores and specialty stores. This channel also includes revenues related to Rock & Republic® products sold in Canada. In Canada and Mexico, our branded products are marketed through mass merchants, department stores, and specialty stores. Additionally, our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel includes non-U.S. sales on digital platforms operated by our wholesale partners, as well as sales in partnership stores located across EMEA, APAC and South America. Partnership stores are operated by our licensees, distributors and other independent parties. They are retail locations selling our Wrangler® and Lee® branded products that have the appearance of Kontoor-operated stores, and as such represent an important vehicle for presenting our brands to international consumers. Similar to the U.S. Wholesale channel, we use proprietary insights from our wholesale customers to strategically refine our products and adjust our go-to-market approach.
Geographically, our net revenue in EMEA is concentrated in developed markets such as France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and the United Kingdom. We access the APAC market primarily through our business in China and India. Canada is the largest international market for Wrangler® branded products, while China is the largest international market for Lee® branded products.
In addition, a small portion of sales in our Non-U.S. Wholesale channel are from international licensing arrangements where we receive royalties based on a percentage of the licensed products’ net revenues. Most of the agreements provide for a minimum royalty requirement. See “Licensing Arrangements” herein for more information.
•Branded Direct-to-Consumer
Our Branded Direct-to-Consumer channel accounted for approximately 12% of our net revenues in 2020 and represents the distribution of our products via our Company-operated Wrangler® and Lee® branded full-price and outlet stores, concession retail locations and our owned websites at www.wrangler.com and www.lee.com. Sales of Wrangler® and Lee® branded products in VF Outlet™ locations are also reported in the Branded Direct-to-Consumer channel while sales of third-party branded merchandise at VF Outlet™ are reported in the Other channel described below. 
Branded Direct-to-Consumer channel allows us to achieve the fullest expression of our brands by displaying our product lines in a manner that supports the brands’ positioning, providing an in-store and online user experience that enables us to address the needs and preferences of our consumers. 
Our 169 concession retail stores are operated in Europe and Asia. Under a typical concession arrangement, we have a dedicated sales area within a retail location and pay a concession fee for use of the space based on a percentage of retail sales. The concession model allows our partners to dedicate specific sales areas to our brands and helps differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products without incurring the incremental overhead of opening a separate store.
5 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K


Our 29 Company-operated full-price Wrangler® or Lee® branded retail stores are located in Asia, Europe and the U.S., and include both mono-brand stores, which exclusively carry either Wrangler® or Lee® branded products, and dual-brand stores, which carry both Wrangler® and Lee® branded products. We also have 57 Company-operated outlet and clearance centers, the majority of which were VF Outlet™ locations in the U.S. that carried Wrangler® and Lee® branded products, as well as third-party branded products. Our other Company-operated outlets are primarily located in Europe, as well as Mexico and Asia. 
During 2020, we performed a strategic review of the VF Outlet™ store fleet. Based on our assessment of store productivity, we chose to exit certain VF Outlet™ stores by not extending leases as they expired for the majority of closures in 2020 and by closing a select number of additional stores. We also decided to convert all remaining locations to Lee Wrangler outlets and clearance centers and to discontinue the sale of third-party branded merchandise. Our remaining stores will only carry Wrangler® and Lee® branded products.
We continue to prioritize serving our customers through digital platforms that enhance the user experience and drive customer interaction in digital and physical environments. Digitally-enabled transactions generated from our own websites represent a growing portion of our net revenues, and help elevate the connection consumers have with our brands. Wrangler® and Lee® branded products are currently available through our own websites in 16 countries.
•Other
The Other channel primarily includes sales of third-party branded merchandise at VF Outlet™ stores. During 2020, we decided to discontinue the sale of third-party branded merchandise in conjunction with our decision to exit certain VF Outlet™ stores. Sales of Wrangler® and Lee® branded products at VF Outlet™ stores are not included in Other and are reported in the Branded Direct-to-Consumer channel discussed above. Prior to 2020, the Other channel also included transactions with VF for pre-Separation activities, none of which continued in 2020. These transactions included sales of VF-branded products at VF Outlet™ stores, as well as sales to VF for products manufactured in our plants, use of our transportation fleet and fulfillment of a transition services agreement related to VF’s sale of its Nautica® brand business in mid-2018. The Other channel accounted for approximately 2% of our net revenues in 2020.
Licensing Arrangements
We seek to maximize our brands’ market penetration and consumer reach by entering into licensing agreements with independent parties. Pursuant to these licensing agreements, we typically grant our licensing partner an exclusive or non-exclusive license to use one of our brands in connection with specific licensed categories of products in specific geographic regions. Our licensing partners leverage the strength of our brands and our customer relationships to sell products in their licensed categories and/or geographic regions. We currently have licensing agreements for jeanswear, casual apparel, belts, footwear, small leather goods and headwear.
We retain oversight and approvals of the design, quality control, advertising, marketing, and distribution of licensed products to ensure adherence to our brand and product quality standards. License agreements are for fixed terms of typically two to five years. Each licensee pays royalties based on its sales of licensed products, with the majority of agreements requiring a minimum royalty payment. Licensing net revenue was $18.7 million in 2020.
Design, Product Development and Innovation 
Our devotion to creative excellence in design, product development and innovation is the foundation of our product strategy. We focus our extensive experience and know-how to create the unique combination of world-class value, quality and styling for our consumers. We operate a multi-site approach to design and product development, with supporting functions in the U.S., Belgium, and Hong Kong. These creative teams collaborate globally with the merchandising, marketing, planning, consumer insights, and executive teams to ensure product delivers against brand positioning, consumer needs, and costs requirements. We have two primary selling seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter although some product lines are offered more frequently.
In addition to our global design and product development functions, we operate two innovation centers in Greensboro, NC. Research for advanced fiber and fabric technology takes place in our dedicated material science lab. Research and development for garment construction, laser processing and wash finishing advancement takes place in our design center. These locations are staffed with dedicated scientists, engineers and designers who leverage our consumer insights to create new designs, and manufacturing and material technologies. Our innovation network is integral to our design approach and our long-term growth as it allows us to deliver products and experiences to meet our consumer needs. 
Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution
Our global supply chain organization is responsible for the operational planning, manufacturing, sourcing, and distribution of products to our customers. We believe we have developed a high degree of expertise in managing the complexities associated with a global supply chain that produced or sourced approximately 120 million units of apparel in 2020. Our supply chain employs a centralized leadership model with localized regional expertise. Within our internal manufacturing facilities, we innovate and design proprietary equipment to drive our production output and capabilities. We focus on engineering and efficiency, which we believe provides an ongoing competitive advantage in our internal manufacturing facilities. We leverage our manufacturing expertise in our sourcing operations, where we have developed longstanding relationships with third-party contract manufacturers and distributors. We believe this manufacturing and sourcing approach, coupled with strategic inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retail customers, gives us operational flexibility as we continue to expand our distribution. 
6 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K


•Sourcing and Manufacturing
We believe the combination of our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing across different geographic regions provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product procurement. Within our own manufacturing facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, polyester, spandex, and lycra blends, as well as thread and trim (such as product identification, buttons, zippers and snaps). Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are typically set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold. We operate global sourcing hubs, which are responsible for managing contract manufacturing and procurement of product, including supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing, and transportation and shipping functions.
We operate ten manufacturing facilities (seven owned facilities in Mexico and three leased facilities in Nicaragua). We also source products from approximately 224 contract manufacturing facilities in over 20 countries. During 2020, approximately 36% of our units were manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities, and approximately 64% were sourced from contract manufacturers. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere frequently have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, internal manufacturing combined with contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for enhanced inventory management in the U.S. market. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and suppliers, we consider several factors including the raw material source, the market the product will be sold in, production lead times, duties and tariffs, product cost, product complexity and the ability to pursue upside demand. Additionally, we continually monitor risks and developments related to duties, tariffs, quotas and other factors and we often manufacture and source products from countries with tariff preferences and free trade agreements.
•Distribution
Products are shipped from our contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. We directly operate the our domestic distribution centers and we carefully select third-party logistic providers as needed in certain regions. All of our distribution centers are strategically located to provide speed and service to our consumers at the most efficient cost possible. Additionally, our established long-term third-party distribution relationships ensure maximum capacity, connectivity, responsiveness, and overall service coverage around the globe. In international markets where we do not have brick & mortar or wholesale operations, our products are marketed through our distributors, as well as agents, licensees, and single-brand or multi-brand partnership stores.
Inventory Management 
Inventory management is key to the cash flows and operating results of our business. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the delivery requirements of our customers, which requires close coordination with our customers. For new product introductions, which often require large initial launch shipments, we may commence production before receiving orders for those products. Key areas of focus include added discipline around the purchasing of product, inventory optimization and channel placement, as well as better planning and execution in disposition of excess inventory through our various channels. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand, while improving our inventory efficiency over the long-term through the ongoing implementation of the Company's global ERP system and inventory optimization tools. 
Advertising and Customer Support
Our advertising and marketing efforts focus on differentiating our brands’ positioning and highlighting our product qualities. We are focused on creating globally unified brand messages with appropriate regional nuances in order to maximize our brand recognition, and drive brand demand from initial end consumer awareness to long-term loyalty. By utilizing global heads of marketing, we will continue to develop integrated, multi-channel marketing strategies designed to effectively reach the target consumers of each of our brands. We pursue this strategy through our use of a variety of media channels and other public endorsements, including traditional media such as television, print, and radio, as well as digital media channels such as display, online video, social media, live streaming, paid search and influencers. We leverage marketing analytics to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments. Our strategy also includes collaborating with new brands and developing new advertising campaigns that drive consumer awareness and brand equity.
We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. Our websites, www.wrangler.com, www.lee.com, and corresponding regional websites, enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. We employ a support team for each brand that is responsible for customer service at the consumer level as well as a sales force that manages our customer relationships.
Seasonality
Absent the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality, with net revenues typically being slightly higher during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. This limited variation results primarily from the differences in seasonal influences on revenues between our Wrangler and Lee segments. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our direct-to-consumer operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative 
7 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K


of future trends. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is usually substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements.
Competition 
The apparel industry is highly competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry with many local, regional and global competitors. We compete in the apparel and accessories sector by leveraging our brands, scale, and ability to develop high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs.
Our primary branded competitors are large, globally focused apparel companies that also participate in a variety of categories, including, but not limited to, athletic wear, denim, exclusive or private labels, casual lifestyle apparel, outerwear and workwear. A select list of key competitors includes Calvin Klein, Carhartt, Diesel, Guess, Levi’s, Tommy Hilfiger and Uniqlo. Additionally, we see a large and growing offering from private label apparel created for retailers such as Amazon, Target and Walmart.
Intellectual Property
Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and marketing of our products, and are important to our continued success. We have registered our intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. In particular, our trademark portfolio consists of over 7,000 trademark registrations and applications in the U.S. and other countries around the world, including U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our two key brands, Wrangler® and Lee®. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, in general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable provided that the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. Typically, trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.
Human Capital
At Kontoor, we understand that our greatest asset is our global employee base. Without our employee's passionate commitment to our purpose, our consumer, and our Company, we would not have been able to pivot as nimbly as we did in 2020. 
As of January 2, 2021, we had approximately 14,000 employees worldwide. Geographically, approximately 1,000 employees are located in APAC, approximately 600 are located in EMEA, approximately 9,500 are located in Latin America and Mexico, and approximately 3,000 are located in the U.S. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.
Supported by a leadership team with deep experience in nurturing vibrant brands that break new ground and inspire consumer loyalty, our employees bring a sense of pride in our rich heritage and an entrepreneurial spirit towards creating our future. Together, they are dedicated to creating quality apparel that is woven with care, style and sensitivity to our planet. This dedicated collaboration is at the core foundation of trust that drives our company’s high-performance culture and our business success. 
•Results-Driven, High-Performance Culture
At Kontoor, we are dedicated to putting our purpose, mission and values at the forefront of everything we do. They serve as our north star, guiding us on our journey and in our decisions to make a positive impact on the world and each other. 
In 2019 and 2020, our purpose, mission and values took root across the organization, starting with roadshows to engage our global audience in the importance and meaning of our new aspirations. As a new company, we embedded our purpose, mission and values within our New Welcome Orientation, and our performance management system to enhance each employee's accountability to live by the core behavioral elements of our values.
•Inclusion, Diversity and Equity
In 2020, we launched our first global inclusion and diversity ("I&D") strategy focused on four strategic pillars: Workplace Belonging, Workforce Diversity, Sustainability & Accountability and Marketplace Equity. In support of our strategy, we implemented a Cultural Foundations learning journey which intentionally focuses on inclusion, embracing change, trust and empathy. At the center of our commitment to evolve and grow our company and workplace culture, we launched and support seven global Employee Resource Groups ("ERG"). ERGs at Kontoor are voluntary, employee-led groups that foster diversity of thought, build community, and provide support for professional and personal development. These communities drive initiatives that employees identify, own, and execute with peers across the global Kontoor network. We established a Global Executive I&D Council, as well as multiple regional councils, who work together to ensure that our I&D efforts are realized.

•Workplace Health & Safety
We prioritize the health, safety and fair treatment of our employees and those who help produce our products. We take the health, safety and well-being of individuals seriously and are committed to only working with supply chain partners who uphold our same standards. In addition to our policies and standards, we often work with contract supplier factories to go beyond worker health and safety to provide opportunities to their surrounding communities like BSR’s HERproject™, a collaborative initiative that strives to empower low-income women working in global supply chains.
Our commitment to safety was evident in the actions and steps we swiftly took in our response to COVID-19. We established a COVID-19 cross-functional task force that aligned our efforts and decisions on our response. 
Social Responsibility, Community Outreach and Sustainability
We are a purpose-led organization and are committed to environmental sustainability, labor welfare and community development, not only because today’s consumers demand the highest standards from the brands they utilize, but because we believe these values are consistent with what our brands represent and are the right thing to do to enhance global welfare. Corporate sustainability and responsibility is an important priority for the Company and the Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for promoting the exercise of responsible corporate citizenship and monitoring adherence to Kontoor’s standards. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and evaluates Kontoor’s strategies, programs, policies and practices relating to environmental, social and governance issues and impacts to support the sustainable and responsible growth of Kontoor’s business. Kontoor believes that in order to grow as a Company, it has a responsibility to help improve the well-being of its communities. Kontoor articulates its commitments to corporate sustainability and responsibility in its Code of Conduct which can be found on Kontoor’s website (www.kontoorbrands.com). In addition, Kontoor issued the Company's first sustainability report in September 2020.
Governmental Regulations
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Our international businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations.
