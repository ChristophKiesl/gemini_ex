ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Organizational Development
 
Petros was organized as a Delaware corporation on May 14, 2020 for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 17, 2020 (the “Original Merger Agreement”), by and between Petros, Neurotrope, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Neurotrope”), PM Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 1”), PN Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 2”), and Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Metuchen”). On July 23, 2020, the parties to the Merger Agreement entered into the First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “First Merger Agreement Amendment”) and on September 30, 2020, the parties to the Original Merger Agreement entered into the Second Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Second Merger Agreement Amendment” and, together with the Original Merger Agreement and the First Merger Agreement Amendment, the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provided for (1) the merger of Merger Sub 1, with and into Metuchen, with Metuchen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Metuchen Merger”) and (2) the merger of Merger Sub 2 with and into Neurotrope, with Neurotrope surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Neurotrope Merger” and together with the Metuchen Merger, the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, Metuchen and Neurotrope became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Petros, and Petros became a publicly traded corporation on December 1, 2020.
 
On December 7, 2020, Neurotrope completed the spin-off of certain assets, whereby (i) any cash in excess of $20,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, and all of the operating assets and liabilities of Neurotrope not retained by Neurotrope in connection with the Mergers were contributed to Synaptogenix, Inc. (formerly known as Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Synaptogenix”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neurotrope and (ii) holders of record of Neurotrope common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, Neurotrope preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share and certain warrants as of November 30, 2020 received a pro rata distribution of common stock of Synaptogenix, resulting in a separate, independent publicly traded company.
 
Business Model and Primary Marketed Products
 
Petros is a pharmaceutical company focused on men’s health therapeutics with a full range of commercial capabilities including sales, marketing, regulatory and medical affairs, finance, trade relations, pharmacovigilance, market access relations, manufacturing, and distribution.
Stendra®
 
Stendra® is an FDA approved PDE-5 inhibitor prescription medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”) and is the only patent-protected PDE-5 inhibitor on the market. As a distinct molecule with high in-vitro affinity and selectivity for penile tissue (clinical significance of this in-vitro selectivity profile is unknown), Stendra® offers the ED therapeutic landscape a valuable addition as an oral ED therapy that may be taken as early as approximately 15 minutes prior to sexual engagement, with or without food when using the 100mg or 200mg dosing (does not apply to 50mg dosing).
 
On September 30, 2016, we acquired from Vivus all of the rights to license, develop, market, sell, and distribute the drug avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) in the United States, Canada, South America, and India, including all assets related to, or necessary for, the exercise of such rights, such as licenses, trademarks, and intellectual property rights. The drug avanafil was initially developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”) and MPTC licensed the rights to avanafil to Vivus in December 2000 (the “MPTC License”). Stendra® (avanafil) was approved by the FDA in April 2012. Petros seeks to make Stendra® the first oral ED prescription therapy available as an over-the-counter option.
 
VED Products
 
Petros also markets its own line of ED products in the form of vacuum erection device (“VED”) products through its subsidiaries, Timm Medical, Inc. (“Timm Medical”) and Pos-T-Vac, LLC (“PTV”). We plan to continue to grow the VED business both domestically and internationally. Petros believes that its potential domestic growth will come through the expansion of its distribution partner network, which currently includes national distributors such as SunMed and Vitalit and internationally through distributors such as Heize (Germany), Mediplus (UK), Euromedical (Spain), as well as a growing number of regional small-business distributors specialized in the urology landscape. Additionally, Petros intends to continue to leverage existing relationships with key clinician decision makers, offering direct purchase agreements for Centers of Excellence in prostate cancer and sexual health rehabilitation. This will allow for increased local purchase availability for consumers. We believe that potential international growth will come through additional work with existing customers to expand our current base of business while also working to unlock new international territories. In addition to expanding the distribution network, Petros is pursuing better use of the historical clinical data available regarding VEDs.

H100™
 
In addition to its ED products, Petros is committed to identifying and developing other pharmaceuticals to advance men’s health. In March 2020, we acquired an exclusive global license to H100™ from Hybrid Medical LLC (“Hybrid”). H100™ is a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease. Peyronie’s disease is a condition that occurs upon penile tissue disruption often caused by sexual activity or injury, healing into collagen-based scars that may ultimately harden and cause penile deformity. Peyronie’s disease may affect millions of men around the world, and there is no approved non-invasive treatment option. Based on current approved therapies, if approved, as of this date H100™ would become the first and only clinically approved topical non-invasive formulation for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. Petros has established its foundation for growth and, with the addition of H100™ to the product portfolio and other pipeline opportunities for additional products, Petros believes that it can build an industry leading men’s health pharmaceutical company. Petros has no other product candidates and no other definitive license agreements at this time. However, Petros is engaged in discussions with viable, late stage therapeutic assets addressing male hormone replacement therapy, male infertility, BPH and prostate cancer, but has not entered into any binding agreements with respect thereto.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
Petros currently only has facilities to assemble its VED products, and therefore must rely on qualified third-party contract manufactures with appropriate facilities and equipment to contract manufacture commercial quantities of its products. If, for any reason, Petros’ contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, it may be required to replace them. Although Petros believes there are a number of potential replacements, it may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.
 
Petros obtains from third parties the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture its products, including the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in its products, such as through the Supply Agreement. Petros is required to identify the supplier of all the raw materials for all FDA-approved products that it acquires from others. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, Petros would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA and, depending on the supplier, provide the FDA with notice or receive FDA approval for the supplier, which would likely delay or interrupt manufacturing of the affected product.
 
Distribution and Marketing
 
Petros has distribution agreements with the three largest pharmaceutical distributors (McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”), Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”), and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”)), as well as a direct purchase program for designated retail dispensing pharmacies within large urology group practices, enabling us to provide Stendra® to customers through most retail pharmacies in the United States. Petros currently depends on McKesson to service these pharmaceutical distribution agreements. McKesson, on an exclusive basis, provides distribution of Stendra® to its own retail pharmacies and handles Petros’ distribution to Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen.
 
In addition to established nationwide distribution mechanisms, Petros also collaborates with several commercial insurance entities with contracted access to Stendra® and enduring capabilities to expand these commercial insurance relationships for future assets. Although commercial insurance collaboration and contracts remain an important factor in patient access and affordability, Medicare and Medicaid remain largely out of scope for Stendra® and most sexual dysfunction therapies. As with many sexual dysfunction therapeutics, Medicare and Medicaid do not normally contract or reimburse for these therapies unless concomitantly indicated for other ailments beyond sexual dysfunction considered medically necessary. Nevertheless, commercial insurance access remains competitive and widely available for Stendra®.
 
Petros relies on a variety of channels to market and sell its products, including:
 

• | employee and third-party contracted sales representatives who promote Stendra® directly to high-volume physician prescribers of ED therapies and target physicians at trade associations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | online digital strategies, including search engine optimization and targeted advertisements, target physicians and consumers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | targeting of managed care organizations to deliver value-based contracts and improve placement for Stendra® on approved drug lists;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaboration with specialty pharmacies that provide personalized service to physicians and patients, including discreet shipping to patients’ homes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | direct marketing of our medical devices to urology offices domestically and internationally.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
 
The Company is dependent upon three wholesale distributors and one direct customer, for approximately 81% of its gross consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. For further information refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition
 
According to data provided by IQVIA, the oral ED market (specifically the PDE-5 inhibitor class) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years especially, with a 26% increase in prescriptions (filled in pharmacies) in 2020 vs. 2019, and with 2019 increasing in oral ED prescriptions by 44% over 2018. As generic options have become available, they have led the growth in prescription volume with an enduring presence of branded prescription volume, indicating durable brand loyalty and value. Stendra® remains the only patent protected brand among the PDE-5 inhibitor class. According to Arizton Advisory and Intelligence Erectile Dysfunction Market Reports, the trajectory of growth in this class is projected to continue to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 8% through 2023. We expect that North America will remain the lead market in this growth due to its established healthcare landscape and the prominence of comorbid conditions associated with ED.
Employees
 
Our Board of Directors oversees our employee relations programs as it views building our culture – from employee development and retention to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives – as key to driving long-term value for our business and helping to mitigate risks.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 27 full time employees, all of whom were based inside the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our pharmaceutical products.
Regulation of Stendra®
 
Although Stendra® was approved by the FDA in April 2012, drug products approved for commercialization are subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, marketing, and promotional activities for such product. These requirements further include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, including manufacturing deviations and reports, registration and listing requirements, the payment of annual fees, continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians for any clinical trials conducted following approval.
 
Regulation of VED Devices
 
The FDA classifies Petros’ VED devices as Class II medical devices, which are typically subject to pre-market review and clearance by the FDA of a pre-market notification (a “510(k) clearance”). While Petros’ VED devices are exempt from 510(k) clearance requirements, they were originally approved under a 510(k) clearance. However, since 2004, the FDA no longer requires a 510(k) submission for Class II external rigidity devices. The process of obtaining marketing approval, authorization, or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies for new products, or for enhancements or modifications to existing products, could take a significant amount of time, require the expenditure of substantial financial and other resources, and require rigorous and expensive pre-clinical and clinical testing.
 
Petros also has ongoing responsibilities related to its VED devices under regulations promulgated by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities. For example, Petros is required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) regulations, which set forth the good manufacturing requirements for medical devices. These include requirements related to design controls, production and process controls, process validation, purchasing controls, supplier oversight, complaint handling and investigation, corrective and preventative actions, and record-keeping. The FDA also regulates the promotion and marketing of medical devices, and requires that manufacturers only make promotional claims or statements that are consistent with the indications and labeling cleared, authorized, or approved by the FDA. For 510(k)-exempt devices, such as the Petros’ VED devices, the FDA requires that Petros promote such products consistent with the relevant device classification. Claims outside the scope of the 510(k)-exempt classification would be considered “off-label” and trigger the requirement for a new 510(k) or other premarket submission to the FDA.
 
Regulatory Approval of H100™
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the “FDCA”) permits the filing of a new drug application (an “NDA”), where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature and/or the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously-approved product and to support the reliance on the applicable published literature or referenced product, referred to as bridging. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, if such approval is supported by study data. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product’s label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions.

Petros currently plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for H100™ for treatment of Peyronie’s disease, which will allow Petros to rely, in part, on published scientific literature and/or the FDA’s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved drug products. If the FDA disagrees with the appropriateness of reliance on a reference listed drug or published literature or if Petros is not otherwise able to bridge to the reference listed drug or published literature, the Company may need to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies, which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays or to the termination of the development program. If Petros is unable to obtain approval through the 505(b)(2) NDA process, it may be required to pursue the more expensive and time consuming 505(b)(1) approval process, which consists of full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness conducted by or for the applicant.
 
Regulation of Third-Party Contract Manufacturers
 
Third-party contract manufacturers that Petros relies on to manufacture commercial quantities of its products are also subject to cGMPs and/or the FDA’s QSR regulations, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies perform ongoing periodic unannounced inspections to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs/QSR and other applicable government regulations. Prior to approving a marketing application, manufacturers will also need to validate their manufacturing process. The FDA will also inspect the proposed manufacturing facilities to confirm that they can produce products meeting the FDA’s regulatory standards.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Petros relies on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights.
 
Petros’ rights to market, distribute and sell avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) are granted under a License and Commercialization Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Vivus entered into on September 30, 2016, which is a sublicense under Vivus’ license agreement with the owner of the Stendra® patent, MTPC. The MTPC License contains certain termination rights that would allow MTPC to terminate the agreement if Vivus were to breach any of the terms of the MTPC License or become insolvent or bankrupt. In the event that MTPC terminates the MTPC License with Vivus because of any contractual breach, Petros has step-in rights with MTPC, which would allow Petros to continue to sell Stendra®. In March 2020, we acquired an exclusive global license (the “Hybrid License”) for the development and commercialization of H100™ from Hybrid Medical LLC (“Hybrid”). H100™ is a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease. The Hybrid License relates to three US patents and two European patents directed to the formulation and use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. U.S. Patent 9,333,242 contains claims directed to a transdermal gel composition containing the unique formulation of H100™. U.S. Patent 9,238,059 contains claims directed to a method for inhibiting or treating Peyronie’s disease, comprising topically administering to a portion of penile dermis of a human with Peyronie’s disease an effective amount of a gel composition containing the formulation of H100™. Additionally, U.S. Patent 10,471,131 contains further formulation claims and method of treatment claims directed to the use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. There are two corresponding European Patents (EP3269372A1 and EP2804606B) that have similar corresponding issued claims. The Hybrid License terminates upon the expiration of the latest patent noted above.
 
Upon entering the Hybrid License, we paid an initial license fee of $100,000, and we will pay to Hybrid annual payments of $250,000 and additional annual milestone payments of $125,000, $150,000 and $200,000 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the entry into the Hybrid License. We are also required to make a $1,000,000 payment upon the first commercial sale and are required to make additional payments on a sliding scale of percentages of net sales in the low single digits. Annual anniversary payments will not be required after commercialization. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments between 3-6% of any net sales. We also expect to incur approximately $14 million of research and development expenses relating to H100™ over the estimated four to six-year period of clinical development prior to FDA approval, including approximately $10 million for clinical trials and $4 million of other expenses.
