Overview
 
Venus Concept Inc. (referred to herein, together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise denotes, as the “Company,” “Venus Concept,” “us” or “we”) is an innovative global medical technology company that develops, commercializes, and delivers minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic and hair restoration technologies. Our aesthetic systems have been designed on a cost-effective, proprietary and flexible platform that enables us to expand beyond the aesthetic industry’s traditional markets of dermatology and plastic surgery, and into non-traditional markets, including family and general practitioners and aesthetic medical spas. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and in 2019, a substantial majority of our systems delivered in North America were in non-traditional markets.
 
In November 2019, we completed our business combination with Venus Concept Ltd. and the business of Venus Concept Ltd. became the primary business of the company. The merger significantly expanded our presence and capability in the hair restoration market with the addition of the ARTAS® System, a robotic hair restoration device, to our device portfolio. The ARTAS® iX Robotic Hair Restoration System was launched in July 2018, which we believe is the first and only robotic intelligent solution to offer precise, minimally invasive, repeatable harvesting and implantation functionality in one platform. Through our NeoGraft® device, which we acquired in 2018, we offer an automated hair restoration system that facilitates the harvesting of follicles during a follicular unit extraction (“FUE”) process, improving the accuracy and speed over commonly used manual extraction instruments. Our hair restoration systems are sold primarily to plastic surgeons and dermatologists, although many of our customer come from other specialties in medicine. In the U.S., we offer doctors using an ARTAS® or NeoGraft® system the services of our VeroGrafters™, a group of approximately 40 independently contracted technicians available to assist the physician during an ARTAS® or NeoGraft® hair restoration procedure. The ARTAS® iX System complements our NeoGraft® hair restoration system and allows us to penetrate a broader segment of the hair restoration market.
 
In addition to our hair restoration systems, we have developed and commercialized nine aesthetic technology platforms. Our product portfolio consists of the Venus Versa™, Venus Legacy®, Venus Velocity™, Venus Fiore™, Venus Viva® and Venus Viva® MD, Venus Freeze Plus™, Venus Glow™, Venus Bliss™, and Venus Epileve™. We have received clearances from the FDA, for our aesthetic and hair devices classified as Class II or greater by the FDA as described in greater detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Outside the U.S., we market our technologies in over 60 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Because each country has its own regulatory scheme and clearance process, not every device is cleared or authorized for the same indications in each market in which a particular system is marketed. 
 
To address the financial barriers faced by physicians and aesthetic service providers, we focus our medical aesthetic product sale strategy on a subscription-based business model in North America and in our well-established direct global markets. Traditional energy-based aesthetic devices can require substantial financial commitments, where next generation products often launch within 18 to 24 months of purchase, making it financially difficult for aesthetic service providers to access the market’s newest technologies, and for providers in non-traditional markets to justify the significant investment. Our subscription-based model is designed to provide a lower initial barrier to ownership and includes an up-front fee, and a monthly payment schedule, typically over a period of 36 months. Our subscription-based business model can provide customers with greater flexibility than traditional equipment leases secured through finance companies. This significantly reduces upfront financial commitment, without onerous credit and disclosure requirements, make this business model increasingly appealing and affordable to non-traditional physicians and medical aesthetic spas. If the economic circumstances are appropriate, we provide customers in good standing with the opportunity to upgrade to our newest available or alternative technology throughout the subscription period. To ensure that each monthly product payment is made on time and that the customers’ systems are serviced in accordance with the terms of the warranty, every product purchased under a subscription agreement requires a monthly activation code, which we provide to the customer upon receipt of the monthly payment. 
 
To support the growth initiatives of our customers, we have developed a practice enhancement program that provides the support and tools necessary for our customers to effectively launch, promote, and grow their businesses, while also supporting the sale of our products and ancillary services. These interactions help in further building our customer relationships.

As of December 31, 2020, we operated directly in 20 international markets through our 16 direct offices in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Spain, France, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Israel, and South Africa.
 
Subscription-based Business Model 
 
We generate recurring monthly revenue under our subscription-based business model. We commenced a subscription-based model in North America in 2011 and, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 46% and 51%, respectively, of aesthetic systems we delivered were sold under the subscription-based model. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 54% and 67% respectively, of our total system revenues were derived from the subscription-based model. We have also launched our subscription-based model in targeted international markets in which we operate directly. We currently do not offer the ARTAS® iX System under the subscription-based model. 
 
Our subscription-based model includes an up-front fee and a monthly payment schedule, typically over a period of 36 months, with approximately 40% of total contract payments collected in the first year. For accounting purposes, these arrangements are considered to be sales-type finance leases, where the present value of all cash flows to be received under the subscription agreement is recognized as revenue upon shipment to the customer and achievement of the required revenue recognition criteria.
 
Market Overview
 
Aesthetic Procedures 
 
The market for aesthetic procedures is large, growing, global in scale, and comprised of both surgical and non-surgical procedures. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (“ISAPS”) reported approximately 25 million cosmetic procedures worldwide in 2019. Total cosmetic procedures worldwide in 2019 was comprised of approximately 11.4 million surgical cosmetic procedures and approximately 13.6 million non-surgical cosmetic procedures. Total non-surgical procedures worldwide in 2019 included approximately 10.6 million injectable procedures – primarily neurotoxin and hyaluronic acid fillers – with the remaining 3.0 million non-surgical, non-injectable procedures worldwide in 2019 representing annual addressable procedure opportunity for our minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic technologies. 
 
Based on data from Medical Insights reports published in 2019, we estimate the global energy-based aesthetic device market totaled approximately $3.4 billion in 2018. We also estimate this market will increase at a 9.7% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, to more than $5.3 billion by the end of 2023. This projected growth CAGR is based on a weighted-average of expected growth CAGRs per Medical Insights of 6.1% for “Energy-Based Aesthetic Devices”, 12.7% for “Energy-Based Body Shaping & Skin Tightening” and 15.0% for “Energy-Based Feminine Rejuvenation”, respectively.
 
Hair Restoration 
 
According to the “2020 Practice Census Results Report” from the International Society of Hair Restoration (“ISHRS”), an estimated 735,312 patients worldwide had a surgical hair restoration procedure in 2019, compared to an estimated 635,189 patients in 2016. The ISHRS estimated the global market for surgical hair restoration treatments totaled $4.6 billion in 2019, compared to $4.1 billion in 2016, representing approximately a 10% increase over the period.
 
We believe several factors are contributing to the growth in the aesthetic and hair restoration markets, including: 
 
 
• | Continuing focus on body image and appearance. Both women and men continue to be concerned with their body image and appearance. Additionally, the population and wealth of the aging “baby boomer” demographic segment and its desire to retain a youthful appearance have driven the growth in aesthetic and hair restoration procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wide acceptance of aesthetic procedures. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (“ASAPS”), in 2019, people in the U.S. spent more than $8.2 billion on combined surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures. Non-surgical procedures have increased, growing 13.3% from 2015 to 2019, and the number of surgical procedures growing 6.2% over the same period.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Broader availability of minimally and non-invasive procedures. Technological developments have resulted in the introduction of a broader range of safe, effective, easy-to-use, and low-cost minimally invasive and non-invasive aesthetic procedures, with fewer side effects. This has resulted in wider adoption of aesthetic procedures by practitioners. According to the ASAPS, nonsurgical procedures were performed more often in 2019 than surgical procedures. There has also been a market shift to less invasive hair restoration procedures such as FUE which, according to ISHRS, have increased from less than 10% of hair restoration procedures performed in 2004 to about 66% in 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased physician focus and changing practitioner economics. Managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions in the United States, and similar payment-related constraints outside of the United States, are motivating practitioners to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients. As a result, in addition to traditional aesthetic providers, non-traditional providers have begun to perform these procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasingly affordable treatment solutions. New, lower cost technologies combined with procedure pricing pressures will broaden the patient population for minimally invasive and non-invasive aesthetic procedures, which we believe will continue to contribute to increased market demand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aesthetic Solutions
 
Traditional Aesthetic Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 
We believe that several limitations have restricted the growth of traditional aesthetic technologies and that patients who do not require significant skin tightening, cellulite reduction, circumferential reduction or body contouring will explore non-invasive alternatives to minimize the pain, expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with current invasive procedures. Most existing non-invasive procedures are based on various forms of directed energy treatments, such as Radiofrequency (“RF”), Intense Pulsed Light (“IPL”), lasers using various wavelengths, shockwave therapy or ultrasound. 
 
Most traditional aesthetic technologies present the following limitations: 
 
 
• | Surgical risks. Traditional aesthetic procedures can carry surgical risks associated with the safety of the patient and generally require administering general or local anesthesia, which can carry additional risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Surgical recovery. Traditional aesthetic procedures can often cause pain and require post-surgical recovery. As a result, patients may need to spend time away from work and take prescribed pain medications during post-surgery recovery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pain and discomfort. Many existing non-invasive procedures involving various laser wavelengths, RF, IPL and shockwave can cause pain during the procedure, which we believe may affect the operator’s ability to deliver a full therapeutic treatment without creating patient discomfort.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potentially undesired results. Traditional invasive procedures can cause non-uniform fat reduction, dimpling, lumpiness, numbness, scarring, discoloration or sagging skin in the treated area. Minimally invasive and non-invasive procedures can cause skin or tissue damage if the physician does not carefully control the heat or ultrasound energy delivered in the treatment area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operator skill and technique dependent. The aesthetic results achieved through most invasive and minimally invasive procedures are dependent upon the operator’s skill and training. In addition, these procedures often require a significant amount of direct physician or highly trained personnel time to perform the procedure. Poor technique may lead to reduced efficacy, inconsistent aesthetic results and adverse events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High cost. Invasive procedures can be significantly more expensive for patients than minimally invasive or non-invasive aesthetic procedures.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Aesthetic Technology Solutions 
 
We have designed a suite of medical aesthetic systems that use our proprietary (MP)2 technology to address the limitations of existing medical aesthetic technologies and procedures. Our systems have the following characteristics: 
 
 
• | Non-invasive. Our systems use technologies that are primarily non-invasive. Our core (MP)2 technology combines multipolar RF and magnetic pulse synthesizers to homogenously raise temperature over the entire treatment area and multiple skin layers. Controlled, targeted, uniform heat distribution and the ability to maintain clinically acceptable therapeutic temperature for the entire treatment results in no heat spikes (thermal surges) and eliminates the need for topical cooling agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy-to-use and delegable technology. We believe that the effective use of our aesthetic systems is not technique-dependent and requires limited training and skills to obtain successful aesthetic results. This allows physicians to leverage their own time and increase throughput since procedures can be performed by non-physician operators, subject to local regulations. We design our systems to be easy to operate with this benefit in mind.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Results for broad range of skin types. Our (MP)2 technology uses proprietary algorithms that harness the benefits of both RF and Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (“PEMF”) therapy. This resulting energy matrix penetrates multiple layers of skin, raising temperature homogenously and effectively. We believe this type of skin penetration improves treated conditions and provides visible results for a broad range of skin types.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology enables products to be designed for affordability. Our technology enables us to focus on designing and manufacturing products at an affordable cost. We offer our products at competitive prices without sacrificing quality, while maintaining our margin objectives. Our competitive prices and subscription model also allow our customers the ability to offer more affordable treatment options to patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Advantages for the Aesthetic Market
 
 
• | Expands potential market. Our subscription-based model enables us to sell to both traditional and non-traditional customers without the involvement of third-party lenders, which allows us to reach many customers who choose not to purchase competitors’ aesthetic products because of the barriers associated with equipment financing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mitigates credit risk. Our 30-day activation code technology helps to mitigate the risk that our customers will default on their payments by disallowing use of the system until we receive the monthly payment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintains strong customer relationships. Our subscription-based model requires us to maintain awareness of customer views and expectations, which allows us to provide high-quality services and maintain an on-going relationship with customers on a month-to-month basis. Our “high-touch” customer philosophy leads to continuous interactions with our customers and enables us to cultivate strong and long-term relationships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Controls secondary market resales. Our 30-day activation code technology also reduces the risk that our products will be resold in the secondary market without authorization. This allows us to control the various distribution channels for our products and maximize the value of our products after purchase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages For Our Customers in the Aesthetic Market
 
 
• | Return on investment. By spreading payments over a 36-month period, our subscription-based model option is designed to facilitate our customers achieving positive cash-flow from their investment in our systems, thus reducing a portion of implementation risk and concerns associated with large initial capital outlays.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of services. Our aesthetic systems allow customers to expand the services offered within their practices. A majority of our systems can be used to treat more than one clinical indication, and some products can be purchased as a modular platform that can be modified to match the needs of a growing aesthetic business. To the extent we are successful in receiving FDA and other clearances for additional clinical indications, the value of our modular platform technologies to customer practices may be further enhanced.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage physician time and clinic infrastructure. Subject to the laws of each state in the United States and in other jurisdictions, our physician customers may delegate these non-invasive procedures to nurse practitioners, technicians, and other non-physicians as long as the systems are operated under the physicians’ supervision. We believe that this creates leverage to save physician time and requires the use of less practice infrastructure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Less onerous credit and disclosure requirements for physicians and clinics. Our subscription-based model allows our customers to purchase our products without the involvement of third-party lenders or leasing companies that require borrowers to undergo burdensome application, review and fee requirements.

Hair Restoration Solutions
 
Traditional Hair Loss Treatment Options and Their Limitations
 
The treatments for hair loss can broadly be divided between non-surgical options and surgical procedures.
 
Non-Surgical Options
 
Traditional non-surgical options for hair loss include prescription therapeutics and non-prescription remedies. In the United States, the FDA has authorized two prescription therapeutics for hair loss: Rogaine which is applied topically, and Propecia which is ingested in pill form. Both Rogaine and Propecia have several drawbacks, including limited efficacy in some individuals, potential side effects and the need for strict patient compliance for the treatment to have meaningful effect. 
Surgical Procedures
 
Surgical procedures to address hair loss, specifically follicular unit transplantation (“FUT Strip Surgery”) and FUE, continue to evolve and become more popular. FUE is significantly less invasive than FUT Strip Surgery. In this procedure, the physician or technician removes individual hair follicles from the patient’s scalp without removing a strip of tissue. FUE can be performed with manual hand-held punches, automated hand-held devices (e.g. NeoGraft®) or robotically with the ARTAS® System.
 

8


FUT Strip Surgery
 
In a FUT Strip Surgery procedure, the physician uses a sharp scalpel to surgically remove a large strip of the patient’s scalp, approximately eight inches in length, and one-half inch in width and depth, from the donor area. The subsequent wound is sutured or stapled closed. Hair follicles are then removed from the strip of scalp, and individual hair follicles are then implanted into the patient’s scalp. FUT Strip Surgery results in a linear scar which may enlarge over time creating a poor aesthetic outcome in the donor area. As a result, strip surgery patients are generally unable to wear their hair short without revealing the scar.
Follicular Unit Extraction Using Hand-Held Devices
 
In a FUE procedure, rather than surgically removing a portion of the patient’s scalp, each hair graft is individually dissected from the scalp for transplantation. Because a strip of the patient’s scalp is not removed, a FUE procedure avoids a long linear scar and reduces the post-operative pain and numbness associated with strip surgery. Following the dissection of the individual hair follicles, the physician uses a hand-held device to remove the hair follicles. After harvesting, the individual hair follicles are implanted in the same way as in a strip surgery procedure.
Limitation of Traditional Hair Loss Treatment Options
 
Drawbacks of FUT Strip Surgery and FUE Surgery Using Hand-Held Devices
 
While FUT Strip Surgery and FUE surgery using a hand-held device (“Manual FUE”), can provide significant, long-term results in restoring hair, there are several limitations associated with these procedures.
 
 
• | Technician training. FUT Strip Surgery and Manual FUE procedures require dexterity, demanding hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail by all members of the transplant team. For strip surgeries in particular, a physician or technician must undergo significant training to dissect grafts under a microscope and it can take a significant period of time for a technician to become proficient.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Labor intensive. Both FUT Strip Surgery and Manual FUE procedures require a team of technicians to perform the procedure. The labor intensiveness, tedious and time-consuming nature of these techniques limits the number of procedures physicians can perform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long learning curve. Both FUT Strip Surgery and manual FUE procedures require a major investment of time on the part of physicians and technicians to learn the technique. A physician must commit a substantial amount of time to learn the Manual FUE harvesting technique and they often report that the technique is technically and ergonomically challenging. For FUT Strip Surgeries, there is a significant time investment made to train each technician to dissect grafts under a microscope, handle the delicate grafts with instrumentation and to place the grafts into the site incisions during implantation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Surgical planning and recipient site making. In making the recipient sites into which hair follicles are transplanted, the ability of the physician and the technician to visualize and avoid injuring existing hair is limited to what they can achieve with magnified lenses. As a result, this limited visualization may compromise the aesthetic outcome.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inconsistency in performance. Both FUT Strip Surgery and Manual FUE procedures require either physicians or technicians to perform the repetitive and tedious tasks of dissecting grafts over a long period of time. In a FUT Strip Surgery, the technicians are required to dissect the individual follicles from the harvested strip of the patient’s scalp, whereas in a Manual FUE procedure the physician and technicians are required to harvest each individual follicle directly from the patient’s scalp. As a result of this lengthy and tedious process, the physician or technician may begin to fatigue and his or her ability to maintain the concentration necessary to consistently extract high-quality grafts without causing follicle damage may diminish.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ARTAS® Solution
 
We believe the ARTAS® System addresses many of the shortcomings of other hair restoration procedures. The ARTAS® System is capable of robotically assisting a physician through many of the most challenging steps of the hair restoration process, including the dissection of hair follicles, site planning and recipient site making. We believe, with this assistance, the ARTAS® System can help shorten the often-long learning curve for both physicians and technicians to become proficient in performing hair restoration procedures. In addition, we believe that by assisting the physician and technicians with many of the repetitive and tedious tasks associated with the hair restoration procedure, the ARTAS® System can make hair restoration procedures less labor intensive and can reduce inconsistent results. Further, we believe the ARTAS® System’s Site Making functionality, which includes an enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms, helps physicians avoid damaging existing follicles and enables them to create a more natural, aesthetically pleasing outcome for the patient. In March 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to expand the ARTAS® technology to include implantation of harvested hair follicles. In December 2018, we completed the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) audit and are compliant with CE Mark requirements for the sale of the ARTAS® iX System with implantation functionality in Europe. 
 
We strategically market the ARTAS® System to hair restoration surgeons, dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic physicians. We believe we can reach our target physician customers effectively through focused marketing efforts. These efforts include participation in trade shows, scientific meetings, educational symposiums, webinars, online advertising and other activities. For physicians who purchase the ARTAS® System, we provide comprehensive clinical training, practice-based marketing support, as well as patient leads. For example, we believe we help our physician customers increase the number of procedures performed by assigning a practice development manager, or PDM, to aid in building the physician-customer’s hair restoration practice. Support from a PDM includes providing assistance with recruitment, consultation, and conversion of patients. Additionally, PDMs deploy patient marketing materials, assist with social media and digital marketing strategies, and provide other marketing and sales support.
 
Advantages of the ARTAS® Procedure 
 
Patient Value. We believe the ARTAS® System significantly improves the patient experience and outcome in hair transplantation procedures in the following ways:
 
 
• | The ARTAS® procedure provides patients with a minimally invasive, less painful alternative to FUT Strip Surgery. The ARTAS® System has a faster recovery time and avoids the long linear scar at the back of the patient’s head.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Through the ARTAS® System, the dissection of grafts is performed in a manner that leaves only small pinpoint scars that heal faster and are less detectable than the larger post-operative linear scar that would be produced from FUT Strip Surgery. As a result, an ARTAS® procedure can, in many cases, offer a shorter recovery time and can enable patients to resume their daily lifestyle faster than with strip surgery. In addition, the ARTAS® procedure allows patients to wear their hair short without a noticeable scar.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ARTAS® Site Making functionality translates the physician-patient site design onto the patient’s recipient area. The ARTAS® System’s enhanced imaging system and sophisticated algorithms enable the ARTAS® System to rapidly create recipient sites at precise depths, replicate pre-existing hair angles, avoid damaging the healthy pre-existing hair and adjust the distribution of the recipient sites to optimally fill in the transplantation area. We believe these elements can contribute to a superior aesthetic outcome.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physician Value. We believe the ARTAS® System provides physicians compelling economic benefits and enables physicians to achieve consistent reproducible results. As a result, we believe the ARTAS® procedure also offers an attractive addition to existing dermatology, plastic surgery or aesthetics practices whether they do or do not provide hair restoration procedures.

• | In addition to the advantages afforded to patients, we believe the ARTAS® System and ARTAS® 3D pre-operative planning software application provide compelling benefits for physicians. The ARTAS® System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform procedures with fewer staff than what might be required for a traditional FUT Strip Surgery or a Manual FUE procedures. With the robotic assistance provided by the ARTAS® System, we believe physicians and technicians will be able to perform the complicated, repetitive and tedious task of dissecting hair grafts with less fatigue and greater productivity than would be possible in a manual FUE procedure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Hair restoration procedures are generally paid for by the patient and do not involve the complexity of securing reimbursement from third-party payors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe the ARTAS® System’s image-guided robotic capabilities allow physicians to perform hair restoration procedures with fewer staff required than a traditional FUT Strip Surgery or a Manual FUE procedure. Procedures can also be performed with less physician and technician fatigue.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Because we provide high quality training for physicians and their clinical teams on the use of the ARTAS® System and because the robotic system and its intelligent algorithms assist these teams in performing hair restoration procedures, we believe we can significantly shorten the learning curve necessary for hair transplantation procedures using the ARTAS® System. This shorter learning curve can reduce barriers to entry for a new hair restoration practice. It can also ease the adoption of a new technology into existing practices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Clinically-Established Results. Four peer-reviewed clinical publications have demonstrated the quality and consistency of grafts produced by the ARTAS® System. One published study indicated average damage rates for the hair follicles, or transection rates, with the ARTAS® System were as low as 6.6%, with a second study documenting average transection rates as low as 4.9% in a separate population of patients. The third study documented that the ARTAS® System can be programmed by the physician to select follicular units with larger groupings of hairs while skipping single hair grafts, which allows physicians to choose particular follicular units depending on the hair density they are trying to achieve, providing a clinical benefit as measured by the increase in hairs per harvest of 17% and as measured by the increase in hairs per graft of 11.4%. Results were statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.01. This study also demonstrates the ability of robotic follicular unit graft selection to increase the amount of hairs a physician can extract for each incision made in the donor area. The fourth study demonstrated that FUE cases larger than 2,500 grafts, or mega-sessions, are possible using the ARTAS® System. These peer-reviewed publications demonstrate the reproducibility and consistency of dissection results from the ARTAS® System in a diverse group of patients, even as the system is used by different clinicians. To our knowledge, there are no other peer-reviewed clinical publications that demonstrate the reproducibility of results utilizing other products in FUE or strip surgery procedures. We intend to encourage scientific research in the study of hair restoration to improve our technology, solutions, enhance understanding of our industry and educate physicians on the capabilities of the ARTAS® System.
 
Advantages of the NeoGraft® Solution
 
We believe that NeoGraft® offers a technology solution that complements our robotic hair restoration system and provides an alternative to FUT Strip Surgery and fully manual FUE procedures for our customers and their patients. 
Patient Value 
 
 
• | Unlike traditional FUT Strip Surgery procedures, the NeoGraft® system is minimally invasive. In a FUE procedure using NeoGraft®, rather than surgically removing a portion of the patient’s scalp, each hair graft is individually dissected from the scalp for transplantation. Because a strip of the patient’s scalp is not removed, a FUE procedure avoids a long linear scar and reduces the post-operative pain and healing process, reducing the risk of potential infection and pain.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ARTAS® iX is currently FDA-cleared for men diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) with black or brown straight hair. The NeoGraft® may also be used for women and people with curly or light-colored hair.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NeoGraft® can be used for fine tuning of small, specific areas of the scalp, temples and temporal peaks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Physician Value

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leading global provider of minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic technologies, hair restoration technologies and their complimentary products. To achieve this goal, we intend to: 

• | Broaden our portfolio of product offering. We continue to invest in and leverage the extensive energy-based technology developed by our experienced research and development team in Israel, and we believe that collaboration with the experienced robotic research and development team in San Jose will bring new and innovative technology solutions to the hair restoration and non-invasive and minimally invasive categories of aesthetic medicine.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Apply robotic technologies to new applications. Our research and development teams in Israel and the United States continue to collaborate on the development of new and innovative technology solutions to the non-invasive and minimally invasive categories of aesthetic medicine. We are working on robotically assisted minimally invasive solutions for aesthetic procedures that currently can only be treated by surgical intervention. Our RoboCor™ device, which we estimate will begin clinical trials in the second quarter of 2021, is being designed to directionally tighten skin through dermal micro-coring, which we believe can result in directional skin tightening without scarring. RoboCor’s intended initial indications are for non-surgical face lift, upper arm lift, necklift, and stretchmarks. We also believe that robotics, machine vision and artificial intelligence can provide significant improvements in the delivery of neurotoxins and volumizers. We are currently investigating the application of our robotic technology to the safe and precise delivery of injectable treatments.

• | Hair restoration market. We continue to focus on providing a complete set of products and services to service the hair restoration market. With ARTAS® and NeoGraft®, we believe that our hair restoration product offering serves a broad segment of the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand FDA (and other regulatory agencies) cleared indications for our products. We intend to seek additional regulatory clearances from the FDA, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, previously CFDA), Health Canada and other national regulatory bodies and to extend the scope of our existing FDA clearance and CE Mark certifications. Additionally, we intend to expand the scope of marketable indications for our technologies in other markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our subscription-based model to new market channels. Our subscription-based model offers our customers an alternative to using third-party lenders and reduces their initial capital expenditure obligations. We believe that with ever increasing restrictions on government reimbursement for medical procedures, there is a large, predominantly untapped market of physicians and physician-owned clinics that are seeking new “pay out-of-pocket” revenue streams. Limited availability of cost-effective capital financing to many non-traditional customers makes it more difficult for these types of providers to build new revenue streams. Our technology and subscription-based model are designed to specifically target, support and address these issues, enabling us to expand into previously untapped markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand into non-traditional markets. We intend to market our systems to current and potential providers of aesthetic services in the large and under-penetrated non-traditional aesthetic market. The ease of use of our technologies makes our systems suitable for adoption by physicians and other providers in non-traditional markets, including general and family practitioners and aesthetic medical spas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our international presence. We have built a direct sales force through wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Spain, France, Germany, Israel, and Australia, with majority-owned subsidiaries in China, Hong Kong, and South Africa, and a strong and growing network of international distributors. We have implemented a strategy to expand our sales and marketing capabilities to establish the Company as a primary participant in the aesthetic device and hair restoration market internationally and believe we are well positioned to continue to grow our revenue from customers located outside North America.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase consumer awareness and demand for our products. We intend to continue to employ targeted and strategic media to engage consumers through social and digital media marketing programs in order to generate awareness of and demand for our technologies, with an emphasis on targeting the non-traditional physician market.

Our Technologies 
 
We use a variety of technologies that allow us to expand into non-traditional physician markets. One differentiating technology is our proprietary multipolar pulsed technology, or (MP)2, which synergizes PEMF and a multipolar RF matrix. Our (MP)2 technology is applicable to a wide range of non-invasive skin tightening, wrinkle reduction, body contouring, cellulite, and fat reduction, which have been cleared in the United States., Canada, and Europe, and we have commenced our entrance into the rapidly growing non-invasive feminine health market in various geographic regions. We also currently have solutions based on other technologies such as fractional ablative RF, IPL and laser technologies, affording a broader set of solution options to address key markets for hair removal, and vascular pigmented lesions, circumference reduction and fat reduction (lipolysis). As part of our strategy, our Venus Freeze Plus® and Venus Fiore® systems come with integrated Automatic Temperature Control (“ATC”) and our Venus Velocity™, Venus Viva®, Venus Fiore™, Venus Freeze Plus™, Venus Bliss™, Venus Epileve™, ARTAS® and NeoGraft® systems come with integrated internet of things (“IOT”) capabilities. 
 
Background on Energy-Based Aesthetic Technologies 
 
RF, a technique that has been employed for several decades for medical purposes, uses an oscillating current of electricity to generate energy in the form of heat. This heat can be used to stimulate, coagulate and/or ablate targeted tissue within the body. RF energy is most commonly used in aesthetic dermatology as a noninvasive method of skin tightening, wrinkle removal, and facial rejuvenation. RF devices that use fractional ablative/coagulative technology have been shown to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in the dermis, while maintaining low risk of adverse side effects in patients of most skin types. This fractional technology uses electrodes to deliver the RF energy to the targeted tissue and has been used for treating a variety of dermatological conditions such as improving facial brightness and improving the appearance of skin tightness and skin pigmentation. RF has been recognized as a solution by various researchers and companies for aesthetic use due to its safety profile on many skin types, limited downtime and results for tissue tightening. 
 
PEMF has demonstrated benefits for soft tissue repair (in cases of various sports related injuries), while exhibiting few side effects. It has been suggested that tissue exposed to PEMF has a modulated production of growth factors leading to elevated production of collagen and other proteins, and improved skin vitality and appearance. PEMF triggers a cascade of biological processes at a cellular level that facilitates the creation of new blood vessels (called angiogenesis). 
 
IPL relies on selective photothermolysis to damage pigmented targets within cells or tissues, causing demarcated thermal injury to the target while sparing surrounding tissue. Light pulses are generated by bursts of electrical current passing through a xenon gas-filled lamp. Individual light pulses have a specific duration, intensity, and fluence, and spectral distribution that allows for a controlled and confined energy delivery into tissue. The effective use of IPL relies on the phenomena that certain targets (chromophores) are capable of absorbing energy from this broad spectrum of light wavelength (absorptive band) without exclusively being targeted by their highest absorption peak. The three main chromophores (hemoglobin, water, and melanin) in human skin all have broad absorption peaks of light energy, allowing them to be targeted by a range of light wavelengths and not requiring that any single specific wavelength of light (monochromatic light) is used. The broad wavelength range discharged from an IPL device leads to the simultaneous emission of different wavelengths that can be further filtered to narrower bands, allowing the various chromophores to be targeted simultaneously but specifically.
 
Our (MP)2 Proprietary Technology 
 
Our proprietary (MP)2 technology employs both PEMF and multipolar RF energy in a synergistic manner. (MP)2 is noninvasive and because (MP)2 disperses heat equally across the treatment area, it does not produce potentially painful localized heat spikes, and unlike other devices employing RF, (MP)2 does not require local cooling during treatment. 
 
PEMFs energy is created by running short pulses of electrical current through metal coils, which results in the formation of electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic fields, in turn, influence the behavior of charged particles, including various biomolecules, within the range of the electromagnetic field to cause one or more desired effects at the cellular level. The non-thermal impact of PEMF therapy is used for aesthetic application requiring enhanced collagen synthesis, for treatment of wounds, and in the management of postsurgical pain and edema. 
 

13


RF energy, on the other hand, delivers radiofrequency energy that manifests itself as heat within various layers of the skin. The heat generated in the tissue by application of RF energy directly affects fibroblasts, extra cellular matrix (“ECM”) and fat cells, thereby triggering natural wound healing processes of the skin and resulting in synthesis of new collagen and elastin fibers. In addition, under predetermined conditions, the heat causes contraction of collagen fibers and lipolysis. In our (MP)2 technology, we employ a multipolar matrix of RF circuits to produce heat. Our multipolar RF matrix distributes the RF currents evenly across the treatment area and volume in a proprietary pattern, which results in the quick and uniform heating of the skin layers without overheating any particular area of the skin. 
 
Elements of (MP)2 Technology 
 

Benefits of (MP)² Technology 
 
Our proprietary (MP)2 technology enables medical and aesthetic practitioners to offer a wide range of non-invasive skin tightening and body contouring solutions. 
 
The main benefits of using (MP)2 technology in non-invasive aesthetic treatments are the following:
 
 
• | Cleared for various indications by the FDA, Health Canada and the European Union (CE Mark).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology that delivers RF energy uniformly. The volumetric homogeneous distribution of heat reduces localized temperature spikes and eliminates the requirement to use a cooling aid, resulting in comfortable treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ergonomic handpieces designed to increase comfort and reduce operator fatigue. A user-friendly interface designed to facilitate intuitive operation, and in most cases does not require an extensive training process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Additional Key Technologies 
 
In addition to our core (MP)² technology, we have technologies that use fractional RF (delivery of ablation and coagulation to pre-determined fractions of the skin), IPL and laser technologies that allow us to address key markets for skin resurfacing, wrinkle reduction, body contouring, noninvasive lipolysis and circumference reduction, hair removal, acne treatment and treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions. In offering these solutions in the markets where we have marketing clearances or approvals, our goal is to provide improved technologies that are safe and effective for their intended uses and economically viable for our customers. 
Fractional Ablative RF 
 
Fractional ablative/coagulative techniques improve the appearance of skin surfaces by micro-injuring the skin in a fractional manner to trigger a healing response in the treated area. This both tightens the skin and elicits collagen formation, thus rejuvenating the skin surface. Because our fractional RF technology does not use lasers or other light technologies, which are skin color dependent, fractional RF can be used on patients of all skin tones. Fractional RF technology has been incorporated into our Venus Viva® applicator, supported by our Venus Viva® , Venus Viva® 
 MD and Venus Versa® systems. 
 

14


Intense Pulsed Light 
 
Our IPL devices employ non-laser high intensity light sources as part of a high-output flash lamp to produce a broad wavelength of non-coherent light, usually in the 400 to 1200 nm range, that may be further filtered to narrower bands per specific absorption coefficients of predetermined chromophore targets and may be applied to remove unwanted hair as well as vascular and pigmented lesions. 
 
We have incorporated IPL technology into our Venus Versa® system to expand that treatment offering and to build a modular, upgradable platform that affords a comprehensive solution for common aesthetic treatments. Specifically, the IPL capability permits users of the Venus Versa® systems to offer their patients the service options of removing unwanted hair, treating acne vulgaris, and treating vascular and pigmented dermal lesions. The Venus Versa® uses a square pulse technology in which continuous pulses of the combination of certain wavelengths create a signal that alternates between a constant fixed intensity for a period of time and then changes to a state of no energy for an amount of time. This allows treatment of an area of the patient without having the tissue exposed to the undesirable lower wavelengths that would be present in a signal with a declining, sinusoidal or other varying pattern of energy. A cooling mechanism is also used, cumulatively allowing for an effective impact using less energy per area in a given time period. This enables efficient treatment while significantly reducing and sparing the patient from the undesired side effects that are sometimes associated with IPL treatments.
 
Diode Lasers 
 
Diode laser technology is a recognized technology for hair removal and lipolysis. The Venus Velocity™ and Venus Epileve™ systems achieve hair removal, permanent hair reduction and treatment of ingrown hair using the diode laser. Both devices employ the laser energy to skin via a chilled sapphire light guide that conductively cools the skin surface simultaneously with the delivery of laser energy that is absorbed in the hair follicle pigment,, thereby maintaining low temperature in the epidermis to enhance the comfort of the procedure and avoid potential epidermal damage while destroying the hair for hair removal. The Venus Velocity™ and the Venus Epileve™ systems allow us to expand our offering in the hair reduction market, which is one of the most popular non-invasive energy based aesthetic procedures in the United States.
 
Our laser technology is also incorporated into another non-invasive diode laser device, the Venus Bliss™. The diode laser system is intended for non-invasive lipolysis of the abdomen and flanks in individuals with a Body Mass Index of 30 or less.

The ARTAS® and ARTAS® iX Systems and Procedure 
 
We believe the ARTAS® and ARTAS® iX Systems have improved multiple phases of the hair transplantation procedure, which include harvesting, recipient site making and implantation.
 
Harvesting
 
During the harvesting phase of the hair restoration procedure, the robotic arm and integrated vision system work in tandem to identify the optimal hair follicles to be used in the procedure. The ARTAS vision system uses proprietary algorithms to identify individual hair follicles, growth angle, density, thickness, length and follicle grouping and to determine which grafts to dissect and the optimal order in which they should be dissected. The algorithms recalculate 60 times per second, accommodating patient movement, to provide the physician with accurate up-to-date information during the course of the procedure. We believe these assessments directly correlate to the quality of the outcome and the state of the donor area. This is important because we believe it affects how the donor area will appear following the procedure, and the potential viability for subsequent harvesting for future transplantation procedures. 
 
25



The ARTAS® System harvesting user interface provides the physician with enhanced control during the procedure. An example of the harvesting user interface appears as follows:
 
Following the vision system’s identification of the optimal hair follicles for transplant, the ARTAS® System dissects these follicles using a sharp needle to score the epidermis and a punch, coaxial with the needle, to separate the graft from the surrounding tissue. In the final step of the harvesting phase, the grafts are removed manually with forceps by the physician or the technician. The grafts are then cleaned, inspected and prepared for implantation.
 
During the procedure, the physician can customize the dissection incisions by choosing a needle and punch that will produce 0.8mm, 0.9mm or 1.0mm incisions. The image below illustrates a typical ARTAS® System punch and needle:



26


The needle travels at speeds such that, when it contacts the skin, it provides targeted precision and a cleanly scored incision. The punch then spins between 3,000 and 5,000 rpm and loosens the grafts from the surrounding tissue. In a clinical setting, we have observed that the dissection cycle takes between one to two seconds per graft, depending on the length of the graft. In a clinical setting, the ARTAS® System has been shown to move from graft to graft at a rate of approximately one to three seconds, thereby enabling the ARTAS® System to dissect a graft every two to five seconds, or approximately 720 to over 1,800 grafts per hour. The ARTAS® System enables the physicians to adjust dissection parameters to accommodate for different types of skin and manipulate graft selection algorithms based on patient needs. The ARTAS® System can be programmed to dissect as many grafts as appropriate thus maximizing the use of the donor area. It can also be programmed to dissect grafts with more than two hairs each, thereby increasing the hair yield or the number of hairs per graft.
 
During the harvesting phase of the hair transplantation procedure, the patient may be lightly sedated, and the integrated vision system can track patient movement and pause if excessive movement is detected.
 
Recipient Site Making
 
Sites, or incisions, are created to receive the harvested grafts. This task is generally performed by the physician. Prior to the ARTAS® System, site making was performed manually using a hand-held tool or needle to create hundreds to thousands of tiny incisions in the scalp. This is a critical step as it creates the hair pattern in which the harvested grafts will grow. From communications with physicians we have found that, typically, a physician can manually create approximately 1,500 sites per hour. Precision and consistency, however, can be affected by experience, hand-eye coordination and fatigue.
 
The ARTAS® System Site Making functionality incorporates artificial intelligence and robotics precision to strategically make surgical incision sites for implanting hair follicles, while also identifying and avoiding injuring healthy follicles in proximity of the implantation sites. This allows the patient’s hair to look more natural and prevents damaging existing healthy hair in the transplant area which we believe would result in patients with more hair than if the sites were made manually.
 
Robotic recipient Site Making is performed by the physician, who develops the ARTAS® System treatment plan, or map, identifying where to make the incisions on the patient. The treatment plan is prepared using three-dimension modeling software that takes one picture of the patient’s recipient area and generates a three-dimensional map that is utilized by the ARTAS® System. With entry angle accuracy, consistency and precise depth control, the ARTAS® System creates the recipient sites using a small solid core needle or a blade at a rate of approximately 2,500 to 3,000 sites per hour, which is significantly faster than the approximately 1,500 sites per hour achieved manually.
 
Implantation
 
Following the site making phase of the hair transplantation procedure, the physician and/or technicians utilizing an ARTAS® System without the implantation functionality will manually implant the grafts in the robotically created sites made by the ARTAS® System. Physicians and technicians utilizing an ARTAS® iX System can utilize the robotic functionality of the system to assist in implanting the dissected follicles. We believe this robotic implantation functionality will help further shorten the learning curve, improve the consistency and reproducibility of results by protecting permanent hair and reducing inconsistencies associated with manual implantation, and could potentially reduce the amount of time each graft spends outside of the scalp and decrease the overall time required for implantation.
ARTAS® Kits for Harvesting and Site Making
 
The ARTAS® System utilizes a set of disposable and reusable kits for our Harvesting and Site Making functionality. Each system comes with a set of reusable items. The disposable kits are included with the purchase of procedures.

Products in Development 
 
On an ongoing basis, we work to bring new and innovative products to market. We are developing the following products and technologies:
 
Directional Skin Tightening (DT) Technology
 
DT is intended as a non-surgical alternative to lift and tighten skin for procedures typically requiring surgical intervention. It uses mechanical vision, artificial intelligence and robotics to achieve the intended outcomes. The punches DT utilizes for coring are designed not to leave scars on tissue. The skin will be contracted after coring by applying a flexible patch to the area which will allow healing of the skin with predefined directional effect.
Electrical/Magnetic Muscle Stimulation Technology
 
Electrical/Magnetic Muscle Stimulation (“EMS/MMS”) is muscle stimulation which assists body contouring and is intended to be complimentary to our Venus Bliss™ device. Muscle stimulation technology is used to stimulate muscle volume in predefined areas of the body by utilizing magnetic fields to create controlled muscle contractions. The EMS/MMS module will be operated with two applicators for use on symmetrical pairs of the muscles and will use smart algorithms to determine the strength and sequences of muscle contraction and relaxation.
Venus Legacy 2.0 
 
We are working on the next generation of the well-established Venus Legacy® product line. This device is intended to extend the capabilities of the original Venus Legacy® system product line by combining (MP)² and VariPulse™ technologies with real-time thermal feedback and ATC to provide homogeneous heating to multiple tissue depths while allowing for adjustable pulsed suction to further support deep energy penetration. This will result in enhanced lymphatic drainage and improved circulation stimulation. The device will come with both hand-held and hands-free applicators. 
 
VeroGrafter Services 
 
In the United States, we offer the services of a group of independently contracted technicians who are certified to assist physicians during a hair restoration procedure.

Technical and Clinical Support 
 
We provide a warranty for the majority of our products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one year, with certain other products carrying a different warranty correlating to the number of uses the product undergoes or based upon the perishability of the product. Once the warranty expires, our customers have the option of purchasing a service contract, which is typically for a term of one to three years.
 

30


We maintain a technical and clinical support team to field inquiries, troubleshoot product issues, facilitate sales activities and support the commercial activities of our direct offices and its international distributors. We provide immediate response technical support to our physician customers and distributors year-round. In the event that an issue arises, our technical support personnel will work with our customers to determine if a technical issue may be resolved over the telephone or requires a service visit. In markets where we do not have our own service engineers, we service and support our products through arrangements handled by our independent distributors. In order to maximize customer “up time,” we proactively deploy replacement systems, modules, and components to strategic hubs worldwide. 
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We have our own research and development center in Yokneam, Israel and use three ISO-certified contract manufacturers in Karmiel, Israel; Mazet, France and Weston, Florida where it manufactures the Venus Legacy system as a virtual manufacturer in an FDA-registered facility. We assemble the ARTAS® iX System in San Jose, California, while reusable and disposable kits are assembled exclusively for us by NPI Solutions, Inc. (“NPI”) based in Morgan Hill, California.
 
We work closely with our manufacturers and perform final quality control testing using our own employees stationed in the manufacturing facilities. Having over 85% of the production of our systems in close proximity to our research and development and operations facilities enables us to control the entire process from product development through manufacturing and final testing, which enables us to provide advanced, high-quality systems as well as the flexibility to create customized solutions for our customers. Also, using multiple manufacturers allows us a greater degree of flexibility in adjusting production levels to meet fast changing market demand. We do not have any long-term supply agreements for components. 
 
Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices intended for distribution in the United States and internationally are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (“QSR”), which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our products. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We conform with and are in full compliance with ISO:13485:2016, CE (MDD→ MDR) and MDSAP.
 
We maintain a quality system designed to be compliant with quality system management and QSR and have procedures in place designed to ensure that all products and materials we purchase conform to our specifications, including evaluation of suppliers, and where required, qualification of the components supplied. Our current facilities are adequate to support our operations.
 
Research and Development
 
Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our current technologies, products, and services, as well as expanding our current product offering with the introduction of new products for different aesthetic, medical and hair restoration applications. Our research and development efforts related to our technologies currently include research to expand indications, broaden our offering of system applicators, advance our proprietary (MP)2 technology, add new technologies and indications (e.g., EMS), refine our harvesting and site making functions, as well as the implantation functionality for the ARTAS® iX System, develop design improvements and new products, and implement a technology platform to record and collect information on each treatment procedure. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred research and development expenses of $7.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively. We expect our research and development expense to vary as different development projects are initiated and completed, as we invest in research, clinical studies, regulatory affairs and development activities over time, and as we continue to expand our business.

We continue to file new trademark applications in many countries to protect our current and future products and related slogans. 
 
License Agreement with HSC Development LLC and James A. Harris, MD
 
In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement, or the HSC license agreement, with HSC Development LLC, or HSC, and James A. Harris, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize products covered by any of the licensed patent rights or that incorporate the licensed technology in the field of performance of hair removal and implantation, including transplantation, procedures using a computer controlled system in which a needle or other device carried on a mechanized arm is oriented to a follicular unit for extraction of same, or to an implant site for implantation of a follicular unit, or some combination thereof. Under the HSC license agreement, we are developing the ARTAS® System to be utilized as a robotic system to assist a physician in performing hair restoration procedures. In consideration for the license, we issued to HSC 25,000 shares of our common stock, prior to the Company’s 1-for-10 reverse stock split, and paid HSC a one-time payment of $25,000. The license grant is perpetual, and the license agreement does not provide a right for HSC or Dr. Harris to terminate the HSC license agreement. The licensed patents cover, in general, a method and device for the extraction of follicular units from a donor area on a patient. The method includes scoring the outer skin layers with a sharp punch, and then inserting a blunt punch into the incision to separate the hair follicle from the surrounding tissue and fatty layer. The method and device significantly decrease the amount of follicular transection and increase the rate at which follicular units can be extracted. There are other embodiments not herein disclosed. The licensed patents will expire from 2025 through 2030.
 
Competition
 
The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. Demand for our systems is impacted by the products and procedures offered by our competitors. Certain of our systems also compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as neurotoxins and dermal fillers, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion. In the United States, we compete against companies that have developed minimally invasive and non-invasive medical aesthetic procedures. Outside of the United States, likely due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are more aesthetic products and procedures available in international markets than are cleared for use in the United States. Sometimes, there are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we may face a greater number of competitors in markets outside of the United States. We also compete generally with medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and services unrelated to skin treatment. Recently, there has been consolidation in the aesthetic industry leading to companies combining their resources, which increases competition and could result in increased downward pressure on our system prices. 
 

32


In the surgical hair restoration market, we consider our direct competition to be FUT Strip Surgeries and Manual FUE procedures. Many of our surgical device and equipment competitors have greater capital resources, sales and marketing operations and service infrastructures than we do, as well as longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. FUT Strip Surgery and some manual FUE procedures have a greater penetration into the hair restoration market, due in part to having a longer history in the market. Our indirect competition in the hair restoration market also includes non-surgical treatments for hair loss, such as prescription therapeutics, including Propecia, and non-prescription remedies, such as wigs, hair pieces and spray-on applications. 
 
We believe that our competitors’ systems compete largely based on the following factors: 
 
 
• | company and product brand recognition;
--+---------------------------------------


• | effective marketing and education;
--+-----------------------------------


• | sales force experience and access;
--+-----------------------------------


• | product support and service;
--+-----------------------------


• | technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing and revenue strategies;
--+--------------------------------


• | product reliability, safety and durability;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | consistency, predictability and durability of aesthetic results; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | procedure costs to patients.
--+-----------------------------

Government Regulation
 
The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. 
 
Regulation by the FDA 
 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA enforces the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the FDCA. 
 
Each medical device that we wish to distribute commercially in the United States requires marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution unless an exemption applies. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorizations applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”). The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness for its intended use(s). Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. 
 
Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval or approval of a de novo reclassification petition prior to commercial marketing. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to nine months but can take longer. For products requiring PMA approval, the regulatory process generally takes from one to three years or more, from the time the application is filed with the FDA and involves substantially greater risks and commitment of resources than either the 510(k) clearance or de novo processes.
 

33


510(k) Clearance 
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA approval, commonly known as the “predicate device.” A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. 
 
We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals were not required.
 
PMA Approval 
 
A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process and is found ineligible for de novo reclassification. PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things: a complete description of the device and its components; a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device; and proposed labeling. Approval of FDA review of an initial PMA application may require several years to complete.
 
Clinical Trials 
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support the FDA’s approval of a premarket approval application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearances. If a device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the device sponsor may need to file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application with the FDA and obtain an IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a “non-significant risk” device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRB”). Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
 
Similarly, in Europe a clinical study must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies of high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. In the EU, physico-chemical tests carried out on the medical device may be necessary in order to obtain the CE mark. These tests must be performed by accredited laboratories for Class II b and III medical devices. The reports and tests are required to be filed in a technical file submitted to the notified body for validation of and obtaining the CE mark. Regulation 2017/745 (MDR) applicable as of May 2021 in the EU will significantly strengthen the requirements for clinical evaluation (EC). The clinical evaluation for class II b and class III medical devices will be based on a critical evaluation of relevant scientific publications, the results of all available clinical investigations as well as the consideration of other medical devices with the same purpose. Regulation 2017/745 notably requires the manufacturer to carry out a post-marketing safety monitoring plan, which includes post-marketing clinical follow-ups (SCAC) in order to update information about the devices marketed throughout its life cycle, and notably any adverse effects. 
 
Post-market Regulation 
 
Any devices that are manufactured or distributed pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA, QSR requirements, labeling and marketing regulations, clearance or approval of product modifications, medical device reporting regulations, correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) compliance, the FDA’s recall authority, and post-market surveillance activities and regulations. 
 
34



We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
 
 
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution; or
--+-------------------------


• | debarment or disqualification.
--+-------------------------------

 
Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. Medical devices requiring clearance or approval, but for which such clearance/approval has not been obtained, also must not be marketed. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 
We received an inquiry from the FDA in August 2018 regarding apparent off-label or unapproved uses of Venus Fiore™. However, we never marketed or promoted Venus Fiore® in the United States and we explained this to the agency. We subsequently added as a precaution a geoblocker functionality to our website, to portray accurately what devices we are marketing in the United States. This matter has been closed by the FDA.
 
Export of Our Products 
 
Export of products subject to the 510(k) notification requirements, but not yet cleared to market, is permitted with the FDA authorization provided certain requirements are met. Unapproved or uncleared products subject to the PMA requirements may be exported if the exporting company and the device meet certain criteria, including, among other things, that the device complies with the laws of the receiving country, has valid marketing authorization from the appropriate authority and the company submits a “Simple Notification” to the FDA when it begins to export. Importantly, however, export of such products may be limited to certain countries designated by statutory provisions, and petitions may need to be submitted to the FDA to enable export to countries other than those designated in the statutory provisions. The petitioning process can be difficult, and the FDA may not authorize unapproved or uncleared products to be exported to countries to which a manufacturer wishes to export. Devices that are adulterated, devices whose label and labeling does not comply with requirements of the country receiving the product, and devices that are not promoted in accordance with the law of the receiving country, among others, cannot be exported.

Fraud and Abuse Regulations 
 
Federal and state governmental agencies subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements they may have with physicians and other potential purchasers of their products. There exist numerous federal and state health care anti-fraud laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs. Violations may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The Federal False Claims Act also contains “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the government. 
 
Venus Concept’s products are not reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. As a result, the federal anti-kickback statute and many federal false claims provisions do not apply to Venus Concept. However, we may be subject to similar state anti-kickback laws that apply regardless of the payor. In addition, various states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act, including “qui tam” or whistleblower provisions, and some of these laws apply to claims filed with commercial insurers. 
 
Compliance with applicable United States and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. 
 
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 
There has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals, such as physicians, and entities. As noted, our products are not reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or federal health care programs, so the U.S. federal reporting laws (such as the federal Sunshine Act) do not apply to Venus Concept. However, certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties, or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 
Foreign Government Regulation 
 
The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution, or other consequences.

European Economic Area 
 
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements set forth in Annex I to the Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, commonly referred to as the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles a manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and to obtain the right to affix the CE mark to medical devices, they must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. The notified body typically audits and examines products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. Following the issuance of this a CE Certificate of Conformity, Venus Concept can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the EC Declaration of Conformity. We have successfully completed several notified body audits since our original certification in December 2009. Following these audits, our notified body issued ISO 13485:2016 Certificate and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing it to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to certain of our devices since 2019 MDSAP Certificate.
 
After the product has been CE marked and placed on the market in the EEA, a manufacturer must comply with a number of regulatory requirements relating to: 
 
 
• | registration of medical devices in individual EEA countries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing and reimbursement of medical devices;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | field safety corrective actions, including product recalls and withdrawals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interactions with physicians.
--+------------------------------

 
In 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
 
The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things: 
 
 
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent that our products have already been certified under the existing regulatory framework, the MDR allows us to market them provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. Under article 120(2) MDR, certificates issued by notified bodies before May 25, 2017 will remain valid until their indicated expiry dates. By contrast, certificates issued after May 25, 2017 will be void at the latest by May 27, 2024. Accordingly, before that date, we will need to obtain new CE Certificates of Conformity. Furthermore, the regulation introduces UDI, i.e. a bar code that must be placed on the label of the device or on its packaging, and manufacturers will be obligated to file adverse effects reports via the Eudamed platform in case there is an increase in the frequency or severity of incidents related to the medical device. 
 
Environmental Regulation 
 
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits. 
Data Privacy and Security 
 
We are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, both in the United States and internationally. New global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information, whether by us, one of our business associates or another third-party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; damages; litigation; consent orders; and injunctive relief. For additional information on the risks we face with regard to data privacy and security, please see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.
 
We are also subject to evolving European laws on data export and electronic marketing. The rules on data export will apply when we transfer personal data to group companies or third parties outside of the EEA. For example, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework, one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the EU to the United States, was invalid and could no longer be relied upon. The U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework was replaced with the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework, which is now under review and there is currently litigation challenging another EU mechanism for adequate data transfers and the standard contractual clauses. It is uncertain whether the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework and/or the standard contractual clauses will be similarly invalidated by the European courts. These changes may require us to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States and we are monitoring developments in this area. The EU is also in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, which will be directly implemented in the laws of each European member state, without the need for further enactment. The current draft of the e-Privacy Regulation retains strict opt-in for electronic marketing and the penalties for contravention have significantly increased with fining powers to the same levels as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament (“GDPR”) (i.e., the greater of 20.0 million Euros or 4% of total global annual revenue).
