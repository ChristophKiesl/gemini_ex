Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2020, we operated 572 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we added 460 beds in the United States (“U.S.”), consisting of 240 added to existing facilities and 220 added through the opening of two joint venture facilities, and we opened six comprehensive treatment centers (“CTCs”). On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of the U.K. business, which included 345 facilities and approximately 8,200 beds. 
 We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.S. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count through acquisitions, de novo facilities, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.
 On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our U.K. operations to RemedcoUK Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales and owned by funds managed or advised by Waterland Private Equity Fund VII (the “U.K. Sale”). The U.K. Sale allows us to reduce our indebtedness and focus on our U.S. operations. As a result of the U.K. Sale, we reported, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. See “U.K. Sale” below for additional details about the U.K. Sale. 
 Our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ACHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, and our telephone number is (615) 861-6000.
 U.K. Sale
 On January 19, 2021, we completed the U.K. Sale pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement in which we sold all of the securities of AHC-WW Jersey Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated in Jersey and a subsidiary of the Company, which constitutes the entirety of our U.K. business operations. The U.K. Sale resulted in approximately $1,525 million of gross proceeds before deducting the settlement of existing foreign currency hedging liabilities of $85 million based on the current British Pounds (“GBP”) to US Dollars (“USD”) exchange rate, cash retained by the buyer of approximately $75 million and transaction costs of $16 million. We used the net proceeds of approximately $1,425 million (or $1,350 million, net of cash retained by the buyer) to repay in full the outstanding balance of our Term Loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) of $312 million and our Term Loan B facility Tranche B-4 (the “Tranche B-4 Facility”) of $768 million of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and added $345 million of cash to the balance sheet. In addition to reducing our indebtedness, the U.K. Sale allows us to focus on our U.S. operations. As a result of the U.K. Sale, we reported, for all periods presented, results of operations and cash flows of the U.K. operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
 COVID-19 Impact
 During March 2020, the global pandemic of the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) began to affect our facilities, employees, patients, communities, business operations and financial performance, as well as the broader U.S. and U.K. economies and financial markets. At many of our facilities, employees and/or patients have tested positive for COVID-19. We are committed to protecting the health of our communities and have been responding to the evolving COVID-19 situation while taking steps to provide quality care and protect the health and safety of our patients and employees. All of our facilities are closely following infectious disease protocols, as well as recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and local health officials. 
 1

We have taken numerous steps to help minimize the impact of the virus on our patients and employees. For example, we: 
  
• | established an internal COVID-19 taskforce;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | instituted social distancing practices and protective measures throughout our facilities, which includes restricting or suspending visitor access, limiting group therapy and screening patients and staff who enter our facilities based on criteria established by the CDC and local health officials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have taken steps to secure our supply chain;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | expanded telehealth capabilities;
--+----------------------------------


• | implemented emergency planning in directly impacted markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | limited all non-essential business travel; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | implemented work-from-home policies for certain employees, to the extent practicable, and suspended in-person trainings and conferences.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 COVID-19 is adversely impacting our business and likely will have an impact on our financial results that we are not currently able to quantify. For example, due in part to local, state and federal guidelines as well as recommendations from medical officials regarding stay-at-home orders, social distancing practices and self-quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a decline in referrals, particularly from emergency rooms and medical professionals. In addition, restrictive measures adopted or encouraged by federal, state and local governments, such as travel bans and stay-at-home orders, have reduced patient volume at our facilities more generally. As a result, many of our facilities experienced significantly lower patient days primarily during late March and April 2020. The impact on our facilities varies based on the market in which the facility operates and the type of facility. During the second quarter of 2020 we saw improvements in patient days which continued into the second half of the year. The improved volume trends were driven by a shift in marketing strategy and efforts and the easing of stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. It is difficult to predict the impact of COVID-19 on our patient volume in future periods given the evolving nature of the pandemic.
 We have developed additional supply chain management processes, which includes extensive tracking and delivery of key personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and supplies and sharing resources across all facilities. However, we are also experiencing supply chain disruptions and could experience significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly PPE. Pandemic-related staffing difficulties and equipment, pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may impact our ability to treat patients at our facilities. Such shortages could lead to us paying higher prices for supplies, equipment and labor and an increase in overtime hours paid to our employees.
 At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $378.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $441.6 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit. In response to the estimated financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to pursue various actions intended to enhance our financial flexibility including, among other things, the benefits described below under the heading “CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments”. In addition, we are evaluating and undertaking certain additional steps to mitigate the financial impact, including:
  
• | reducing maintenance and expansion capital expenditures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | managing corporate and facility-level staffing costs by aligning staffing to patient volumes and implementing a temporary hiring freeze for non-clinical staff;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reducing discretionary expenditures and temporarily reducing marketing spending;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating with our vendors and lessors for discounts and/or revised payment terms; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closely managing our working capital as our facilities continue to bill and collect for services rendered and extend payments on traditional accounts payables.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although we are reviewing potential liquidity and intend to seek any available benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), including those described herein, we cannot predict the manner in which such benefits will be allocated or administered and we cannot assure you we will be able to access such benefits. In addition, procuring these benefits and otherwise responding to the global pandemic is likely to require us to dedicate additional management resources.

Financing Transactions
 We entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”), on April 1, 2011. On December 31, 2012, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We have amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time as described in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility” for additional information.
 On January 29, 2021, we issued conditional notices of full redemption providing for the redemption in full of $650 million of 5.265% Senior Notes due 2013 (“5.265% Senior Notes”) and $390 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (“6.500% Senior Notes”) to the holders of such notes. The redemption of this $1,040 million of additional debt, along with the payment of breakage costs of $6 million and estimated transaction costs of $9 million, is expected to be completed in early March 2021 and to be funded from cash from the balance sheet of $430 million and proceeds from a new senior secured credit facility of $625 million. We expect to enter into a new term loan and revolver as part of a five-year senior secured credit facility.
 On January 5, 2021, we made a voluntary payment of $105.0 million on our Tranche B-4 Facility. On January 19, 2021, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the U.K. Sale to repay $311.7 million of our TLA Facility and $767.9 million of our Tranche B-4 Facility of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
 On November 13, 2020, we entered into the Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment (the “Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment extended the maturity date of each of the existing revolving line of credit and the existing TLA Facility from November 30, 2021 to November 30, 2022. The Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment also (1) replaced the revolving line of credit in an aggregate committed amount of $500.0 million to an aggregate committed amount of approximately $459.0 million and (2) replaced the TLA Facility aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $352.4 million to an aggregate principal amount of approximately $318.9 million. The interest rate margin applicable to both facilities remains unchanged from the prior facilities, and the commitment fee applicable to the new revolving line of credit also remains unchanged from the prior revolving line of credit. In connection with the Fourth Repricing Facilities Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $1.0 million, including the write-off of discount and deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On October 14, 2020, we issued $475.0 million of 5.00% Senior Note due 2029 (the”5.000% Senior Notes”). The 5.000% Senior Notes mature April 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.000% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2021. We used the net proceeds of the 5.000% Senior Notes to prepay approximately $453.3 million of the outstanding borrowings on our existing Term Loan B facility Tranche B-3 (the “Tranche B-3 Facility”) and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the offering. In connection with the 5.000% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $2.9 million, including the write-off of discount and deferred financing cost in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On June 24, 2020, we issued $450.0 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the”5.500% Senior Notes”). The 5.500% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021. As further described below, we used the net proceeds of the 5.500% Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full the outstanding 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “6.125% Senior Notes”) and the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “5.125% Senior Notes”) and to pay related fees and expenses in connection therewith. 
 On June 10, 2020, we issued conditional notices of full redemption providing for the redemption in full of the 6.125% Senior Notes and 5.125% Senior Notes on July 10, 2020 (the “Redemption Date”), in each case at a redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the Redemption Date (the “Redemption Price”). On June 24, 2020, we satisfied and discharged the indentures governing the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes by irrevocably depositing with a trustee sufficient funds equal to the Redemption Price for the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes and otherwise complying with the terms in the indentures relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 6.125% Senior Notes and the 5.125% Senior Notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.3 million, including the write-off of the deferred financing and other costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On April 21, 2020, we entered into the Thirteenth Amendment (the “Thirteenth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Thirteenth Amendment amended the Consolidated Leverage Ratio in the existing covenant to increase the leverage ratio for the rest of 2020.
 3

On February 27, 2019, we entered into the Twelfth Amendment (the “Twelfth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Twelfth Amendment, among other things, modified certain definitions, including “Consolidated EBITDA”, and increased our permitted Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, thereby providing increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants.
On February 6, 2019, we entered into the Eleventh Amendment (the “Eleventh Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” to remove the cap on non-cash charges, losses and expenses related to the impairment of goodwill, which in turn provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. 
 On December 1, 2018, we exercised the option to redeem in whole $7.5 million and $15.5 million of Lee County (Florida) Industrial Development Authority Healthcare Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 with stated interest rates of 9.0% and 9.5% (“9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds”) at a redemption price equal to the sum of 104% of the principal amount of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 On March 29, 2018, we entered into a Third Repricing Facilities Amendment (the “Third Repricing Facilities Amendment”, and together with the Second Repricing Facilities Amendment, the “Repricing Facilities Amendments”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment replaced the existing revolving credit facility and TLA Facility with a new revolving credit facility and TLA Facility, respectively. The Company’s line of credit on its revolving credit facility remains at $500.0 million and the Third Repricing Facility Amendment reduced the size of the TLA Facility from $400.0 million to $380.0 million to reflect the then current outstanding principal. The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate by 25 basis points for the revolving credit facility and the TLA Facility by amending the definition of “Applicable Rate.”
 On March 22, 2018, we entered into a Second Repricing Facilities Amendment (the “Second Repricing Facilities Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Repricing Facilities Amendment (i) replaced the Term Loan B facility Tranche B-1 (the “Tranche B-1 Facility”) and the Term Loan B facility Tranche B-2 (the “Tranche B-2 Facility”) with the Tranche B-3 Facility and a new Tranche B-4 Facility, respectively, and (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate from 2.75% to 2.50% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and reduced the Applicable Rate from 1.75% to 1.50% in the case of Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Competitive Strengths 
 Management believes the following strengths differentiate us from other providers of behavioral healthcare services:
 Premier operational management team with track record of success. Our management team has approximately 200 combined years of experience in acquiring, integrating and operating a variety of behavioral health facilities. The extensive national experience and operational expertise of our management team give us what management believes to be the premier leadership team in the behavioral healthcare industry. Our management team strives to use its years of experience operating behavioral healthcare facilities to generate strong cash flow and grow a profitable business.
 Favorable industry and legislative trends. According to a 2019 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“SAMHSA”), 20.6% of adults in the U.S. aged 18 years or older suffered from a mental illness in the prior year and 5.2% suffered from a serious mental illness. Further, approximately 7.8% of people aged 12 or older in 2018 needed substance use treatment in the past year. According to a study by The Journal of American Medical Association Pediatrics, an estimated 7.7 million U.S. children has a treatable mental health disorder. Management believes the market for behavioral services will continue to grow due to increased awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions and treatment options. 
 While the growing awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions is expected to accelerate demand for services, recent healthcare reform in the U.S. is expected to increase access to industry services as more people obtain insurance coverage. A key aspect of reform legislation is the extension of mental health parity protections established into law by the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the “MHPAEA”). The MHPAEA requires employers who provide behavioral health and addiction benefits to provide such coverage to the same extent as other medical conditions. On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriates substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contains measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. On October 21, 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment 
 4

(“SUPPORT”) for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act expands Medicare coverage to include Opioid Treatment Programs for services provided on or after January 2, 2020. It also includes Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its Execution Act (“IMD CARE Act”), which suspends the current prohibition on using federal Medicaid funds to pay for substance use disorder treatment at inpatient treatment facilities with more than 16 beds and limits beneficiaries to no more than 30 days of inpatient treatment per 12 month period. 
 Leading platform in attractive healthcare niche. We are a leading behavioral healthcare platform in an industry that is undergoing consolidation in an effort to reduce costs and expand programs to better serve the growing need for inpatient behavioral healthcare services. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count.
 Diversified revenue and payor bases. At December 31, 2020, we operated 572 facilities in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. Our payor, patient and geographic diversity mitigates the potential risk associated with any single facility. For the year ended December 31, 2020, exclusive of our U.K. operations, we received 49% of our revenue from Medicaid, 29% from commercial payors, 16% from Medicare and 6% from other payors. As we receive Medicaid payments from 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, management does not believe that we are significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies in any one state or territory. Excluding the U.K. operations, no facility accounted for more than 4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and no state or U.S. territory accounted for more than 12% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our increased geographic diversity will mitigate the impact of any financial or budgetary pressure that may arise in a particular state or market where we operate.
 Strong cash flow generation and low capital requirements. We generate strong free cash flow by profitably operating our business and by actively managing our working capital. Moreover, as the behavioral healthcare business does not typically require the procurement and replacement of expensive medical equipment, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are generally less than that of other facility-based healthcare providers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our maintenance capital expenditures amounted to approximately 2% of our revenue. 
 Business Strategy
 We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we have aligned our activities around the following growth strategies:
 Increase margins by enhancing programs and improving performance at existing facilities. Management believes we can improve efficiencies and increase operating margins by utilizing our management’s expertise and experience within existing programs and their expertise in improving performance at underperforming facilities. Management believes the efficiencies can be realized by investing in growth in strong markets, addressing capital-constrained facilities that have underperformed and improving management systems. 
 Opportunistically pursue acquisitions and partnerships. We have positioned the Company as a leading provider of mental health services in the U.S. The behavioral healthcare industry in the U.S. is highly fragmented, and we selectively seek opportunities to expand and diversify our base of operations by acquiring additional facilities and entering into partnerships with healthcare providers to acquire and develop additional facilities. We have a number of potential joint ventures and acquisitions in various stages of development and consideration in the U.S.
 Management believes our focus on behavioral healthcare and history of completing acquisitions provides us with a strategic advantage in sourcing, evaluating and closing acquisitions. We leverage our management team’s expertise to identify and integrate acquisitions based on a disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on quality of service, return on investment and strategic benefits. We also have a comprehensive post-acquisition strategic plan to facilitate the integration of acquired facilities that includes improving facility operations, retaining and recruiting psychiatrists and other healthcare professionals and expanding the breadth of services offered by the facilities.
 Drive organic growth of existing facilities. We seek to increase revenue at our facilities by providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients. In addition, management intends to increase bed counts in our existing facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we added 460 beds in the U.S., consisting of 240 added to existing facilities and 220 added through the opening of two joint venture facilities, and we opened six CTCs. For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect to add approximately 300 beds to existing facilities and 170 beds through the opening of one wholly-owned facility and one joint venture 
 5

facility and expect to open 11 CTCs. Furthermore, management believes that opportunities exist to leverage out-of-state referrals to increase volume and minimize payor concentration, especially with respect to our youth and adolescent focused services and our substance abuse services.
 U.S. Operations
 Our facilities in the U.S. (the “U.S. Facilities”) and services can generally be classified into the following categories: acute inpatient psychiatric facilities; specialty treatment facilities; residential treatment centers; and outpatient community-based facilities. The table below presents the percentage of our total U.S. revenue attributed to each category for the year ended December 31, 2020:
 
 
Facility/Service | Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 | 
---------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+---
Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities | | 47 | %
Specialty treatment facilities | | 38 | %
Residential treatment centers | | 14 | %
Outpatient community-based facilities | | 1 | %

 
We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our U.S. Facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”); and (iv) individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2020, in our U.S. Facilities, we received 49.7% of our revenue from Medicaid, 28.5% from commercial payors, 15.8% from Medicare and 6.0% from other payors.
 At December 31, 2020, our U.S. Facilities included 227 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 9,900 beds in 40 states and Puerto Rico. Of our U.S. Facilities, excluding CTCs, approximately 45% are acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, approximately 39% are specialty treatment facilities, approximately 13% are residential treatment centers and approximately 3% are outpatient community-based facilities at December 31, 2020. Of the 227 behavioral healthcare facilities, 131 are CTCs, which is a subset of specialty treatment facilities. Of our CTCs, 17 are owned properties and 114 are leased properties. Of the 96 facilities that are not CTCs, 74 are owned properties and 20 are leased properties. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our U.S. operations generated revenue of $2,089.9 million and $2,008.4 million, respectively.
 Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities
 Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide a high level of care in order to stabilize patients that are either a threat to themselves or to others. The acute setting provides 24-hour observation, daily intervention and monitoring by psychiatrists. Generally, due to shorter lengths of stay, the related higher patient turnover, and the special security and health precautions required, acute inpatient psychiatric facilities have lower average occupancy than residential treatment centers. Our facilities that offer acute care services provide evaluation and crisis stabilization of patients with severe psychiatric diagnoses through a medical delivery model that incorporates structured and intensive medical and behavioral therapies with 24-hour monitoring by a psychiatrist, psychiatric trained nurses, therapists and other direct care staff. Lengths of stay for crisis stabilization and acute care range from three to five days and from five to twelve days, respectively.
Specialty Treatment Facilities
 Our specialty treatment facilities include residential recovery facilities, eating disorder facilities and CTCs. We provide a comprehensive continuum of care for adults with addictive disorders and co-occurring mental disorders. Our detoxification, inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient treatment programs are cost-effective and give patients access to the least restrictive level of care. All programs offer individualized treatment in a supportive and nurturing environment.
 The majority of our specialty treatment services are provided to patients who abuse addictive substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs or opiates, including prescription drugs. Some of our facilities also treat other addictions and behavioral disorders such as chronic pain, sexual compulsivity, compulsive gambling, mood disorders, emotional trauma and abuse. The goal of our treatment facilities is to provide the appropriate level of treatment to an individual no matter where they are in the lifecycle of their disease in order to restore the individual to a healthier, more productive life, free from dependence on illicit substances and destructive behaviors. Our treatment facilities provide a number of different treatment services such as assessment, detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, counseling, education, lectures and group therapy. We assess and evaluate the medical, psychological and emotional needs of the patient and address these needs in the treatment process. Following this assessment, an individualized treatment program is designed to provide a foundation for a lifelong recovery process. Many modalities are used in our treatment programs to support the individual, including the twelve step philosophy, cognitive/behavioral therapies, supportive therapies and continuing care.

Residential Recovery Facilities. Our inpatient facilities house and care for patients over an extended period and typically treat patients from a broadly defined regional market. We provide three basic levels of residential treatment depending on the severity of the patient’s addiction and/or behavioral disorder. Patients with the most severe dependencies are typically placed into inpatient treatment, in which the patient resides at a treatment facility. If a patient’s condition is less severe, he or she will be offered day treatment, which allows the patient to return home in the evening. The least intensive service is where the patient visits the facility for just a few hours a week to attend counseling/group sessions.
 Following primary treatment, our extended care programs typically offer residential care, which allows patients to develop healthy and appropriate living skills while remaining in a safe and nurturing setting. Patients are supported in their recovery by a semi-structured living environment that allows them to begin the process of employment or to pursue educational goals and to take personal responsibility for their recovery. The structure of this treatment phase is monitored by a primary therapist who works with each patient to integrate recovery skills and build a foundation of sobriety with a strong support system. Length of stay will vary depending on the patient’s needs with a minimum stay of 30 days and could be multiple months if needed.
 Our outpatient clinics serve patients that do not require inpatient treatment or are transitioning from a residential treatment program; have employment, family or school commitments; and have stabilized in their substance addiction recovery practices and are seeking ongoing continuing care.
 Eating Disorder Facilities. Our eating disorder facilities provide treatment services for eating disorders and weight management, each of which may be effectively treated through a combination of medical, psychological and social treatment programs.
 Comprehensive Treatment Centers. Our CTCs specialize in providing medication-assisted and abstinent-based treatment. Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders. CTCs utilize medication-assisted treatment to individuals addicted to opiates such as opioid analgesics (prescription pain medications) and heroin. Medication is used to normalize brain chemistry to block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids allowing our professional staff to provide behavioral therapy. Patients begin their treatment attending the clinic almost daily. Then, through successfully progressing in treatment, patients attend less frequently depending on individual treatment plans. The length of treatment differs from patient to patient, but typically ranges from one to three years.
 Each of our CTCs provide a range of comprehensive substance abuse treatment support services that include medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other treatment services. Our behavioral therapies are delivered in an array of treatment models that may include individual and group therapy, intensive outpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization/day treatment, road to recovery and other programs that can be either abstinent or medication assisted based.
 Residential Treatment Centers
 Residential treatment centers treat patients with behavioral disorders in a non-hospital setting, including outdoor programs. The facilities balance therapy activities with social, academic and other activities. Because the setting is less intensive, demands on staffing, security and oversight are generally lower than inpatient psychiatric facilities. In contrast to acute care psychiatric facilities, occupancy in residential treatment centers can be managed more easily given a longer length of stay. Over time, however, residential treatment centers have continued to serve increasingly severe patients who would have been treated in acute care facilities in earlier years.
 We provide residential treatment care through a medical model residential treatment facility, which offers intensive, medically-driven interventions and individualized treatment regimens designed to deal with moderate to high level patient acuity. Children and adolescents admitted to these facilities typically have had multiple prior failed treatment plans, severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse, termination of parental custody, substance abuse, marked deficiencies in social, interpersonal and academic skills and a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Treatment typically is provided by an interdisciplinary team coordinating psychopharmacological, individual, group and family therapy, along with specialized accredited educational programs in both secure and unlocked environments. Lengths of stay range from three months to several years.
 Certain of our residential treatment centers provide group home, therapeutic group home and therapeutic foster care programs. Our group home programs provide family-style living for youths in a single house or apartment within residential communities where supervision and support are provided by 24-hour staff. The goal of a group home program is to teach family living and social skills through individual and group counseling sessions within a real life environment. The residents are encouraged to take responsibility for the home and their health as well as actively take part in community functions. Most attend an accredited and licensed on-premises school or a local public school. We also operate therapeutic group homes that provide comprehensive treatment services for seriously, emotionally disturbed adolescents. The ultimate goal is to reunite or place these children with their families or prepare them, when 
 7

appropriate, for permanent placement with a relative or an adoptive family. We also manage therapeutic foster care programs, which are considered the least restrictive form of therapeutic placement for children and adolescents with emotional disorders. Children and adolescents in our therapeutic foster care programs often are part of the child welfare or juvenile justice system. Care is delivered in private homes with experienced foster parents who are trained to work with children and adolescents with special needs.
 Outpatient Community-Based Facilities
 Our community-based facilities can be divided into two age groups: children and adolescents (seven to 18 years of age) and young children (three months to six years of age). Community-based programs are designed to provide therapeutic treatment to children and adolescents who have a clinically-defined emotional, psychiatric or chemical dependency disorder while enabling the youth to remain at home and within their community. Many patients who participate in community-based programs have transitioned out of a residential facility or have a disorder that does not require placement in a facility that provides 24-hour care.
 Community-based programs developed for these age groups provide a unique array of therapeutic services to a very high-risk population of children. These children suffer from severe congenital, neurobiological, speech/motor and early onset psychiatric disorders. These services are provided in clinics and employ a treatment model that is consistent with our interdisciplinary medical treatment approach. Depending on their individual needs and treatment plan, children receive speech, physical, occupational and psychiatric interventions that are coordinated with services provided by their referring primary care physician. The children generally receive treatment during regular business hours.
 U.K. Operations
 Overview
 Prior to the U.K. Sale, we were the leading independent provider of mental health services in the U.K. operating 345 inpatient behavioral health facilities with approximately 8,200 beds at December 31, 2020. The facilities are located in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our U.K. operations generated revenue of $1,119.8 million and $1,099.1 million, respectively, primarily through the operation and management of inpatient behavioral health facilities. 
 Description of U.K. Facilities
 Prior to the U.K. Sale, we provided inpatient services through a variety of facilities, including mental health hospitals, clinics, care homes, schools, colleges and children’s homes in the U.K. In addition to these services, we also operated a U.K. division that leverages on our clinical knowledge to provide Employee Assistance Programs (“EAP”) to organizations.
 Our former facilities in the U.K. (the “U.K. Facilities”) and services can generally be classified into the following categories: healthcare facilities, education and children’s services and adult care facilities. The table below presents the percentage of our total U.K. revenue attributed to each category for the year ended December 31, 2020:
 
 
Facility/Service | U.K. Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 | 
----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+---
Healthcare facilities | | 55 | %
Education and Children’s Services | | 16 | %
Adult Care facilities | | 29 | %

 
Prior to the U.K. Sale, we received payments from approximately 500 public funded sources in the U.K. (including the National Health Services (“NHS”), Clinical Commissioning Groups (“CCGs”) and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2020 in our U.K. Facilities, we received 91% of our revenue from public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and 9% from other payors.
 At December 31, 2020, our U.K. Facilities included 345 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 8,200 beds, including approximately 1,100 non-residential education places, in the U.K. Of our U.K. Facilities, approximately 22% were healthcare facilities, approximately 18% were education and children’s services facilities and approximately 60% were adult care facilities at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, we owned 279 of the properties at our U.K. Facilities and leased 66 properties.

Additional information about our U.K. operations and the U.K.’s behavioral healthcare industry can be found in our prior filings with the SEC.
 Sources of Revenue
  As of December 31, 2020, we received payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (iv) public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales); and (v) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue and Accounts Receivable” for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenue, income and other operating information is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulation
 U.S. Overview
 The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare program participation requirements, various licensure and accreditation standards, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and government healthcare program fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to loss or limitation of licenses to operate, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. 
Licensing, Certification and Accreditation
 All of our facilities must comply with various federal, state and local licensing and certification regulations and undergo periodic inspection by licensing agencies to certify compliance with such regulations. The initial and continued licensure of our facilities and certification to participate in government healthcare programs depends upon many factors including various state licensure regulations relating to quality of care, environment of care, equipment, services, staff training, personnel and the existence of adequate policies, procedures and controls. Federal, state and local agencies survey our facilities on a regular basis to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with regulatory operating and health standards and conditions for participating in government healthcare programs.
 Most of our inpatient and residential facilities maintain accreditation from private entities, such as The Joint Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”). The Joint Commission and CARF are private organizations that have accreditation programs for a broad spectrum of healthcare facilities. The Joint Commission accredits a broad variety of healthcare organizations, including hospitals and behavioral health organizations. CARF accredits behavioral health organizations providing mental health and alcohol and drug use and addiction services, as well as opiate treatment programs, and many other types of healthcare programs. These accreditation programs are intended generally to improve the quality, safety, outcomes and value of healthcare services provided by accredited facilities. Certain federal and state licensing agencies as well as many government and private healthcare payment programs require that providers be accredited as a condition of licensure, certification or participation. Accreditation is typically granted for a specified period, ranging from one to three years, and renewals of accreditation generally require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey.
 Certificates of Need
 Many of the states in which we operate facilities have enacted certificate of need (“CON”) laws that regulate the construction or expansion of certain healthcare facilities, certain capital expenditures or changes in services or bed capacity. Failure to obtain CON approval of certain activities can result in: our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement; the imposition of civil penalties; the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement; or the revocation of a facility’s license, any of which could harm our business.
Audits
 Our healthcare facilities are also subject to federal, state and commercial payor audits to validate the accuracy of claims submitted to government healthcare programs and commercial payors. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to make substantial repayments, subject to various appeal rights. Several of our facilities have undergone claims audits related to their 
 9

receipt of payments during the last several years with no material overpayments identified. However, potential liability from future audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations, as well as commercial payor contracts, also provide for withholding or suspending payments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
 The Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law
 The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, in cash or in kind, as an inducement or reward for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for referrals or orders of services or other items paid for by a government healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute may be found to have been violated if at least one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A provider is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute to be found guilty of violating the law.
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) has issued safe harbor regulations that protect certain types of common arrangements from prosecution or sanction under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements falling outside the safe harbors may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. In December of 2020, the OIG finalized revisions to the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors and created new safe harbors for value-based care that became effective January 19, 2021. The new regulations are intended to improve patient care and foster innovative care models by easing regulatory burdens to coordinated and value-based care.
 Although management believes that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws.
 In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to healthcare entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship for the furnishing of any “designated health services” unless certain exceptions apply. A violation of the Stark Law may result in a denial of payment; required refunds to the Medicare program; imposition of civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 for each prohibited claim, up to $172,137 for circumvention schemes and up to $20,489 for each day the entity fails to report required information; exclusion from government healthcare programs; and liability under the False Claims Act. There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions for many customary financial arrangements between physicians and facilities, including the employment exception, personal services exception, lease exception and certain recruitment exceptions. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare finalized revisions to the exceptions and created new exceptions for value-based care that became effective on January 19, 2021. As with the changes made to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the new Stark exceptions are intended to improve patient care and foster innovative care models by easing regulatory burdens to coordinated and value-based care. 
 Management believes that our financial arrangements with physicians are structured to comply with the regulatory exceptions to the Stark Law. However, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that no intent is required to violate the law, and even a technical violation may lead to significant penalties.
 These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our arrangements relating to facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict whether other federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
 If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the government healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act 
 The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) contains a number of provisions aimed at identifying at-risk individuals, increasing access to opioid abuse treatment, reducing overprescribing and promoting data sharing with the primary goal of reducing the use and abuse of opioids. Additionally, the SUPPORT Act attempts to address the problem of “patient brokering” in the context of addiction treatment facilities and sober living homes. 
 One section of the SUPPORT Act, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (“EKRA”), makes it a federal crime to knowingly and willfully: (1) solicit or receive any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility or laboratory; or (2) pay or offer any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction under the EKRA is punishable by up to $200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statutes, EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government healthcare program. The EKRA also contains exceptions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors, but those exceptions are more narrow than the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors such that practices that would be permissible under the Anti-Kickback Statute may violate EKRA.
 Federal False Claims Act and Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 The federal False Claims Act provides the government a tool to pursue healthcare providers for submitting false claims or requests for payment for healthcare items or services. Under the False Claims Act, the government may fine any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly submits, or causes the submission of, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal government has widely used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other federal healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. Claims for services or items rendered in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law can provide a basis for liability under the False Claims Act as well. The False Claims Act is also implicated by the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later.
 Violations of the False Claims Act are punishable by significant penalties totaling $11,665 to $22,331 for each fraudulent claim plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition, under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, private parties may bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, known as relators, are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, whistleblower lawsuits have increased significantly in recent years. Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act or that otherwise prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the state government or Medicaid program.
 In addition to the False Claims Act, the federal government may use several criminal laws, such as the federal mail fraud, wire fraud or health care fraud statutes, to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Most states have also adopted generally applicable insurance fraud statutes and regulations that prohibit healthcare providers from submitting inaccurate, incorrect or misleading claims to private insurance companies. Management believes our healthcare facilities have implemented appropriate safeguards and procedures to complete claim forms and requests for payment in an accurate manner and to operate in compliance with applicable laws. However, the possibility of billing or other errors can never be completely eliminated, and we cannot guarantee that the government or a qui tam plaintiff, upon audit or review, would not take the position that billing or other errors, should they occur, are violations of the False Claims Act.
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (“PHI”). The privacy and security regulations control the use and disclosure of PHI and the rights of patients to be informed about and control how such PHI is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
 The HIPAA security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. HITECH has strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of PHI, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates and created security breach notification requirements including notifications to the individuals affected by the breach, the Department of Health and Human Services, and in certain cases, the media. HITECH has also increased maximum penalties for violations of HIPAA privacy rules. Management believes that we have 
 11

been in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and have developed our policies and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance, although we cannot guarantee that our facilities will not be subject to security incidents or breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is intended to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical screening examination when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition regardless of an individual’s ability to pay. Hospitals are then required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with emergency medical conditions. If a hospital is unable to stabilize a patient within its capability, or if the patient requests, an appropriate transfer must be implemented. EMTALA imposes additional obligations on hospitals with specialized capabilities, such as ours, to accept the transfer of patients in need of such specialized capabilities if those patients present in the emergency room of a hospital that does not possess the specialized capabilities.
Mental Health Parity Legislation
 The MHPAEA was signed into law in October 2008 and requires health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other illnesses. The MHPAEA has some limitations because health plans that do not already cover mental health treatments are not required to do so, and health plans are not required to provide coverage for every mental health condition published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption which operates to exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA’s requirements if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly.
 On December 13, 2016, then President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriated substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contained measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. 
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “PPACA”) dramatically altered the U.S. health care system. PPACA sought to provide coverage and access to substantially all Americans, to increase the quality of care provided and to reduce the rate of growth in health care expenditures. PPACA attempted to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding the Medicare program’s use of value-based purchasing programs, bundling payments to hospitals and other providers, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments to providers, expanding Medicaid eligibility and tying reimbursement to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria.
 On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump became President of the United States. Shortly after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order that, among other things, stated that it was the intent of his administration to repeal PPACA and, pending that repeal, instructed the executive branch of the federal government to defer or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of PPACA that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, or penalty on any individual, family, health care provider or health insurer. Several bills have been introduced and voted upon in the House of Representatives and United States Senate that would either repeal and replace or simply repeal PPACA, although none have been enacted to-date.
 On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order intending to expand the availability of so-called association health plans and short-term plans outside PPACA’s requirements. President Trump also announced that the administration would cease making cost-sharing reduction payments to health insurance companies that help cover out-of-pocket costs for low-income individuals. On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law. The Tax Act effectively eliminated PPACA’s individual health insurance mandate as of 2018 by reducing to zero the tax penalty associated with failure to maintain health insurance coverage.
 During the 2018 election cycle, Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives, effectively eliminating the possibility that PPACA will be repealed entirely during the next two years. Still, it remains difficult to predict whether PPACA will be replaced or modified; what the effect will be of the health care-related provisions in the Tax Act; or the impact that the President’s executive actions will have on the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of PPACA or the regulations adopted or to be adopted to implement the law or the President’s executive orders. In addition, if PPACA is replaced or modified, it remains unclear what the replacement plan or modifications would be, when the changes would become effective, or whether any of the existing provisions of PPACA would remain in place. 
 12

In 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas ruled that PPACA in its entirety is invalid. That decision has been stayed pending appeal, and will likely remain unresolved until finally decided by the United States Supreme Court. The United States Supreme Court heard oral argument of the case in November 2020 and a decision has yet to be issued.
 There have been and likely will continue to be a number of legal challenges to various provisions of the law and President Trump’s executive actions. On January 20, 2021, Joseph Biden became President of the United States and Democrats gained control of the United States Senate. President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 seeking to strengthen PPACA and repealing two of former President Donald Trump’s executive orders related to PPACA. It is likely that the Biden administration will continue to support PPACA and halt any repeal efforts. 
 Limitations on the availability of adequate insurance coverage for patients seeking services at our facilities; any reductions in government healthcare spending; and the possible Supreme Court invalidation of some or all of PPACA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 CARES Act and Other Regulatory Developments 
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act is intended to provide over $2 trillion in stimulus benefits for the U.S. economy. Among other things, the CARES Act includes additional support for small businesses, expands unemployment benefits, makes forgivable loans available to small businesses, provides for certain federal income tax changes, and provides $500 billion for loans, loan guarantees, and other investments for or in U.S. businesses.
 In addition, the CARES Act contains a number of provisions that are intended to assist healthcare providers as they combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those provisions include, among others:
  
• | an appropriation of $100 billion to the PHSSE Fund for a new program to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible healthcare providers and other approved entities for COVID-19-related expenses or lost revenue;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expansion of CMS’ Accelerated and Advance Payment Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | waivers or temporary suspension of certain regulatory requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 As noted above, the U.S. government initially announced it would offer $100 billion of relief to eligible healthcare providers through the PHSSE Fund. On April 24, 2020, President Trump signed into law the New PPP Act. Among other things, the New PPP Act allocates $75 billion to eligible healthcare providers to help offset COVID-19 related losses and expenses. The $75 billion allocated under the New PPP Act is in addition to the $100 billion allocated to healthcare providers for the same purposes in the CARES Act and has been disbursed to providers under terms and conditions similar to the CARES Act funds. We received approximately $19.7 million of the initial PHSSE funds distributed in April 2020. We received approximately $12.8 million of additional PHSSE funds in August 2020. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded $32.8 million of other income in the consolidated statements of operations related to $34.9 million of PHSSE funds received from April through December 2020. Our recognition of this income was based on revised guidance in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 enacted in December 2020. 
 Using existing authority and certain expanded authority under the CARES Act, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has expanded CMS’ Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A and Part B providers for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the program, our facilities were eligible to request up to 100% of their Medicare payment amount for a three-month period. Under the original terms of the program, the repayment of these accelerated/advanced payments would have begun 120 days after the date of the issuance of the payment and the amounts advanced to our facilities would have been recouped from new Medicare claims as a 100% offset. Our facilities would have had 210 days from the date the accelerated or advance payment was made to repay the amounts that they owe.
 On October 1, 2020, Congress amended the terms of the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to extend the term of the loan and adjust the repayment process. Under the new terms of the program, all providers will have 29 months from the date of their first program payment to repay the full amount of the accelerated or advance payments they have received. The revised terms extend the period before repayment begins from 210 days to one year from the date that payment under the program was received. Once the repayment period begins, the offset will be limited to 25% of new claims during the first 11 months of repayment and 50% of new claims during the final 6 months. The revised program terms also lower the interest rate on outstanding amounts due at the end of the 
 13

repayment period from 10% to 4%. We applied for and received approximately $45 million in April 2020 from this program, which we expect to repay over the 12 month period beginning April 2021.
 Also under the CARES Act, we received a 2% increase in our facilities’ Medicare reimbursement rate as a result of the temporary suspension of Medicare sequestration from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021.
 The CARES Act also provides for certain federal income and other tax changes, including an increase in the interest expense tax deduction limitation and bonus depreciation of qualified improvement property. Furthermore, under the CARES Act, (i) for taxable years beginning before 2021, net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and carrybacks may offset 100% of taxable income and (ii) NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 taxable years may be carried back to each of the preceding five years to generate a refund. As a result, in 2019 and 2020 we received a benefit, in the form of refunds and lower future tax payments, of $51.6 million, consisting of $22.8 million related to interest expense, $20.5 million related to qualified improvement property legislation, and an $8.3 million permanent benefit due to the loss being able to be carried back at a 35% tax rate to offset income in tax years prior to 2018 (21% for tax years after 2017). We also received a cash benefit of approximately $39 million for 2020 relating to the delay of payment of the employer portion of Social Security payroll taxes, as enacted by the CARES Act.
 In addition to the financial and other relief that has been provided by the federal government through the CARES Act and other legislation passed by Congress, CMS and many state governments have also issued waivers and temporary suspensions of healthcare facility licensure, certification, and reimbursement requirements in order to provide hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare providers with increased flexibility to meet the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, CMS and many state governments have temporarily eased regulatory requirements and burdens for delivering and being reimbursed for healthcare services provided remotely through telemedicine. CMS has also temporarily waived many provisions of the Stark law, including many of the provisions affecting our relationships with physicians. Many states have also suspended the enforcement of certain regulatory requirements to ensure that healthcare providers have sufficient capacity to treat COVID-19 patients. These regulatory changes are temporary, with most slated to expire at the end of the declared COVID-19 public health emergency.  
 We are continuing to evaluate the terms and conditions and financial impact of funds received under the CARES Act and other government relief programs.
 Corporate Integrity Agreement
 During the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement (the “CIA”) with the OIG imposing certain compliance obligations on us and our subsidiary, CRC Health. For further discussion of the background of this matter and the CIA, see “Risk Factors— We could be subject to increased monetary penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from federal healthcare programs, if we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.” 
 U.K. Overview
 The regulatory environment applicable to healthcare facilities in the U.K. is complex and multifaceted. The regulatory regime is made up of multiple statutes, regulations and minimum standards that are subject to continuous change. The laws and regulations applicable to the U.K. Facilities include, without limitation, the Mental Capacity Act of 2005, Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006, Mental Health Act of 2007, Health and Social Care Act of 2008 and Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007. These laws and regulations are predominantly protective in nature and share the same general underlying purpose to protect vulnerable persons from exploitation or harm. The regulatory requirements relevant to our facilities in the U.K. cover our operations from the initial establishments of new facilities, which are subject to registration and licensing requirements, to the recruitment and appointment of staff, occupational health and safety, duty of care to service users, clinical and educational standards, conduct of our professional and support staff and other areas.
 Risk Management and Insurance
 The healthcare industry in general continues to experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. As is typical in the healthcare industry, we are subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our patients or clients or other adverse effects. In addition, resident, visitor and employee injuries also subject us to the risk of litigation. While management believes that quality care is provided to patients and clients in our facilities and that we substantially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 14

Our statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. A portion of our professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. We are self-insured for professional liability claims up to $3.0 million per claim and have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third party to cover claims in excess of the retention limit. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $75.0 million in the aggregate. Our reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place.
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our facilities, the identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as the removal of such materials, the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of our patients. The management of infectious medical waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, which establish management requirements for such waste. These requirements include record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the disposal of medical waste. The use of such companies, however, does not completely protect us from violations of medical waste laws or from related third-party claims for clean-up costs.
 From time to time, our operations have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental or health and safety laws or regulations. Management believes that our operations are generally in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements or that any non-compliance will not result in a material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations at our facilities have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new or changes in existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We have not been notified of and management is otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our currently or formerly operated facilities that could result in material liability or cost to us under environmental laws or regulations for the investigation and remediation of such contamination, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any such contamination conditions. There may, however, be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 New laws, regulations or policies or changes in existing laws, regulations or policies or their enforcement, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation liabilities, compliance costs, fines and penalties, or liability and claims for alleged personal injury or property damage due to substances or materials used in our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other behavioral healthcare service companies, including Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) and other hospitals and general healthcare facilities that provide mental health services. An important part of our business strategy is to continue making targeted acquisitions of other behavioral health facilities. However, reduced capacity, the passage of mental health parity legislation and increased demand for mental health services are likely to attract other potential buyers, including diversified healthcare companies, other pure-play behavioral healthcare companies and private equity firms.
 In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete for patients. Patients are referred to our behavioral healthcare facilities through a number of different sources, including healthcare practitioners, public programs, other treatment facilities, managed care organizations, unions, emergency departments, judicial officials, social workers, police departments and word of mouth from previously treated patients and their families, among others. These referral sources may instead refer patients to hospitals that are able to provide a full suite of medical services or to other behavioral healthcare centers.

Human Capital
 At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 42,200 employees (approximately 21,000 in the U.S. and approximately 21,200 in the U.K.), of which 28,600 were employed full-time. At December 31, 2020, labor unions represented approximately 392 of our U.S. employees at four of our U.S. Facilities through seven collective bargaining agreements. Organizing activities by labor unions and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future. 
 Typically, our inpatient facilities are staffed by a chief executive officer, medical director, director of nursing, chief financial officer, clinical director and director of performance improvement. Psychiatrists and other physicians working in our facilities are licensed medical professionals who are generally not employed by us and work in our facilities as independent contractors or medical staff members.
 Seasonality of Demand for Services
 Our residential recovery and other inpatient facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the holidays, and our child and adolescent facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the summer months, holidays and other periods when school is out of session.
