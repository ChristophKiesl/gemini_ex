Corporate History and Structure
 
Overview
 
Code Chain New Continent Limited, formerly known as TMSR Holding Company Limited and JM Global Holding Company, was a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2015. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets. On June 20, 2018, the Company consummated the reincorporation. As a result, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada and implemented a 2-for-1 forward stock split of the Company’s common stock.
 
Effective as of May 18, 2020, the Company changed its corporate name from “TMSR Holding Company Limited” to “Code Chain New Continent Limited” pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update
 
Recently, there is an ongoing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in China and has since spread rapidly globally. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of stores and business facilities globally for the past few months. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. Given the rapidly expanding nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and because substantially all of our business operations and our workforce are concentrated in China, we believe there is a risk that our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be adversely affected, especially for our export related business. Potential impact to our results of operations will also depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or mitigate its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.
 
The impacts of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | We temporally closed our offices and production facilities to adhere to the policy beginning in February 2020, as required by relevant PRC regulatory authorities. Our offices are slowly reopening pursuant to local guidelines.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our customers could potentially be negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may reduce the demand of our products. As a result, our revenue and income may be negatively impacted in 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The situation may worsen if the COVID-19 outbreak continues. We will continue to closely monitor our collections throughout 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the business disruption and the related financial impact related to the outbreak of and response to the coronavirus cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. For a detailed description of the risks associated with the novel coronavirus, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business could be materially harmed by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.”

Industry Overview
 
Chinese Coal Trading Market
 
Global coal is still the main energy source. According to the International Energy Agency’s Global Coal Market Report (2018-2103) on February 25, 2019, global demand for coal will remain stable in the next five years. China will remain the world’s biggest consumer of coal. In particular, the clean and efficient development of China's coal industry, as well as the strengthening of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and soot emission control, has made coal once again a very attractive energy source. In addition, due to its affordable price, abundant reserves and convenient transportation, coal remains the main energy source in many other countries besides China. Therefore, the coal market in China remains strong.

Recent Development 
 
Proposed Reorganization
 
General
 
On March 23, 2020, the Board of Directors and majority stockholders (the “Consenting Stockholders”) holding an aggregate of 15,491,952 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March 22, 2020 took action by written consent to approve the conversion of the Company from a Nevada corporation to a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Conversion”).
  
On April 1, 2020, the Board and the Consenting Stockholders took action by written consent to approve an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name to “Code Chain New Continent Limited” (the “Name Change”) and to change the ticker symbol of the Common Stock and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase one-half of one shares of Common Stock at a price of $2.88 per half share ($5.75 per whole share) to “CCNC” and “CCNCW”, respectively (the “Symbol Change”).
 
Following the completion of the Conversion, we are expected to qualify as a “foreign private issuer” under the rules and regulations of the SEC and we expect that the reduced reporting obligations associated with being a foreign private issuer will reduce operational, administrative, legal and accounting costs in the long term. We will remain subject to the mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and, as long as our ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq, the governance and disclosure rules of that stock exchange. However, as a foreign private issuer, we will be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act that would otherwise apply if we were a company incorporated in the United States or did not meet the other conditions to qualify as a foreign private issuer. For example:
 

● | we will not be required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will not be required to conduct advisory votes on executive compensation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will be exempt from filing quarterly reports under the Exchange Act with the SEC;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will not be subject to the requirement to comply with Regulation FD, which imposes certain restrictions on the selected disclosure of material information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will not be required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will not be required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8

 

We expect to take advantage of these exemptions if the Conversion is effected. Accordingly, after the completion of the Conversion, if you hold our securities, you may receive less information about the Company and our business than you currently receive with respect to the Company and be afforded less protection under the U.S. federal securities laws than you are entitled to currently. However, consistent with our policy of seeking input from, and engaging in discussions with, our stockholders, on executive compensation matters, we intend to provide disclosure relating to its executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices and conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation once every three years after the Conversion is effected. However, we expect to review this practice after the next such advisory vote and may at that time or in the future determine to conduct such advisory votes more frequently or to not conduct them at all.
 
Additionally, as a foreign private issuer, we will be permitted to follow corporate governance practices in accordance with Cayman Islands laws in lieu of certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards, such as the following Nasdaq corporate governance standards requiring that:
 

● | the majority of the board of directors be comprised of independent directors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | executive compensation be determined by independent directors or a committee of independent directors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | director nominees be selected, or recommended for selection by the board of directors, by independent directors or a committee of independent directors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an audit committee be comprised of at least three members, each of whom is an independent director and one of whom has finance and accounting experience; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all related party transactions be reviewed by the audit committee or another independent body of the board of directors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Harney Westwood & Riegels, our Cayman Islands counsel, has advised us that there are no comparable Cayman Islands laws related to the above corporate governance standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not intend to initially rely on any Nasdaq exemptions or accommodations for foreign private issuers following the Conversion.
 
We believe the Conversion and the related reorganization will enhance stockholder value. However, we cannot predict what impact, if any, the Conversion and reorganization will have in the long term in light of the fact that the achievement of our objectives depends on many things, including, among other things, future laws and regulations, as well as the development of our business.
 
The Conversion, the Name Change and Symbol Change are not effective as of the date of this report. For a discussion of the risk factors associated with the reorganization, please see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Conversion.”
 
 Effect of the reorganization
 
By virtue of the Conversion, all of the rights, privileges and powers of the Company, all property owned by the Company, all debts due to the Company and all other causes of action belonging to the Company immediately prior to the Conversion will remain vested in the Company following the Conversion. In addition, by virtue of the Conversion, all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company immediately prior to the Conversion will remain attached to the Company following the Conversion. The Company will remain as the same entity following the Conversion, and the Conversion will not effect any change in our business, management or operations or the location of our principal executive offices.
 
Upon effectiveness of the Conversion, all of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock under Nevada laws will be automatically converted into issued and outstanding shares of share capital of under Cayman Islands laws, without any action on the part of our stockholders.
 
The Conversion will have no effect on the trading of our shares of capital stock. Upon the effectiveness of the Symbol Change, our ordinary shares are expected to continue listing on Nasdaq Capital market under the new symbol “CCNC”.
 
Upon effectiveness of the Conversion, our directors and officers will remain as directors and officers. We believe that the Conversion will not affect any of our material contracts with any third parties, and that our rights and obligations under such material contractual arrangements will continue as rights and obligations of the Company incorporated in Cayman Islands.
 
Procedure for Effecting the Conversion
 
To accomplish the Conversion, the Board has adopted a plan of conversion. The Plan of Conversion provides that we will convert into an exempted company limited by shares in Cayman Islands and will thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of the Companies Law.
 
Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and our warrants are quoted on the OTC Pink. Pursuant to Rule 10b-17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Conversion, the Name Change and the Symbol Change will require FINRA’s approval in order for it to be recognized for trading purposes. Furthermore, the Conversion, the Name Change and the Symbol Change will result in a change in the CUSIP numbers of our Common Stock (or ordinary share after the conversion) and Warrants. We will provide definitive information on our FINRA approval and new CUSIP numbers in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the effective date of such Conversion, the Name Change and the Symbol Change. In addition, we are required to notify Nasdaq of the Conversion, the Name Change and the Symbol Change. Specifically, we are required to notify Nasdaq of the Symbol Change no later than two business days prior to the change, the Conversion as soon as practical after the change, and the Name Change no later than 10 calendar days after the change.

The Board will cause the Conversion to be effected as soon as practicable thereafter by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada articles of conversion (the “Articles of Conversion”) and applying to the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands to be registered by way of continuation as an exempted company limited by shares under the Companies Law. In addition, the Company will adopt the Proposed Articles after the Conversion.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion may be delayed by the Board or the Plan of Conversion may be terminated and abandoned by action of the Board at any time prior to the effective time of the Conversion, whether before or after approval by our stockholders, if the Board determines for any reason that such delay or termination would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
 
The Conversion will become effective upon the filing (and acceptance thereof by the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and the Registrar of Companies of Cayman Islands, as applicable) of the Articles of Conversion and the date of registration specified in the certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands confirming registration by way of continuation. The Name Change and Symbol Change will become effective upon will become effective upon the filing (and acceptance thereof by the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and the Registrar of Companies of Cayman Islands, as applicable) of the Certificate of Amendment and approval by FINRA.

Environmental Matters
 
As of December 31, 2020, Rong Hai and Wuge were not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority.
Governmental Regulations
 
Business license
 
Any company that conducts business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Our business license covers our present business of manufacturing, sale and lease of environment protection equipment, development of environment protection technologies and related technology and consulting services. Prior to expanding our business beyond that of our business license, we are required to apply and receive approval from the PRC government.
 
Employment laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, work permits and travel restrictions. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance. China’s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and amended on August 27, 2009, and China’s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, and amended on December 28, 2012, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract.
 
Intellectual property protection in China
 
Patent. The PRC has domestic laws for the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also signatory to some of the world’s major intellectual property conventions, including:

● | Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Patents in the PRC are governed by the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations, each of which went into effect in 1985. Amended versions of the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations came into effect in 1993, 2001 and 2009, respectively.
 
10

 

The PRC is signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in accordance with which any person who has duly filed an application for a patent in one signatory country shall enjoy, for the purposes of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the period fixed in the convention (12 months for inventions and utility models, and 6 months for industrial designs).
 
The Patent Law covers three kinds of patents — patents for inventions, utility models and designs. The Chinese patent system adopts the principle of first to file, which means that a patent may be granted only to the person who first files an application. Consistent with international practice, the PRC allows the patenting of inventions or utility models that possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability only. For a design to be patentable it cannot be identical with, or similar to, any design which, before the date of filing, has been publicly disclosed in publications in the country or abroad or has been publicly used in the country, and should not be in conflict with any prior right of another.
 
Copyright. Copyright in the PRC, including copyrighted software, is principally protected under the Copyright Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Under the Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software is 50 years.
Trademark. Registered trademarks are protected under the Trademark Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Trademarks are registered with the Trademark Office of the SAIC. Where registration is sought for a trademark that is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or given preliminary examination and approval for use in the same or similar category of commodities or services, the application for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Trademark registrations are effective for a renewable ten-year period, unless otherwise revoked. The duration of a trademark is 10 years from the date of registration.
 
Domain names. Domain name registrations are handled through domain name service agencies established under the relevant regulations, and applicants become domain name holders upon successful registration.
 
Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Corporate Income Tax
 
The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.
 
Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of The Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of The Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
 
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
 

● | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 


● | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not believe that we meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph.
 
We believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” As all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our ordinary shares.
 
Value-Added Tax and Business Tax
 
In November 2011, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax. In May and December 2013 and April 2014, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 37, Circular 106 and Circular 43 to further expand the scope of services which are to be subject to Value-Added Tax, or VAT, instead of business tax. Pursuant to these tax rules, from August 1, 2013, VAT will be imposed to replace the business tax in certain service industries, including technology services and advertising services, on a nationwide basis. The VAT rate shall be 17% for sale or importation of goods by a taxpayer. But, unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the revenue from services provided.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Exchange Regulation
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.
 
12

 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our PRC operations. In the event we need to do so, we will apply to obtain the relevant approvals of SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.
 
SAFE Circular 37
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.
 
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.
 
Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. We will make efforts to comply with these requirements upon completion of our initial public offering.

Regulation of Dividend Distribution
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside as general reserves at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. None of our operating subsidiaries or variable interest entities is currently a party to any such claims or proceedings which, if decided adversely to the Company, would either, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees
 
As of March 24, 2021, Wuge, Rong Hai had 36 and 18, respectively, full-time employees.
 
We have not experienced any significant labor disputes and consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement.
 
As we continue to expand our business, we believe it is critical to hire and retain top talent, especially in the areas of marketing and technology engineering. We believe we have the ability to attract and retain high quality engineering talent in China based on our competitive salaries, annual performance-based bonus system, and equity incentive program for senior employees and executives. In addition, we have a training program for entry-level engineers that allows them to work closely with an experienced mentor to gain valuable hands-on experience and provide other professional development opportunities, including seminars where experienced engineers give lectures on specific engineering topics and new methods that can be applied to various projects.
