Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
WRAPmail Inc. (the Company, WRAPmail, we, us, or our) was organized in Florida in October, 2005. The Company effected a 10 for 1 forward stock split on December 27, 2010; and a 1 for 10 reverse stock split on June 4, 2013.

On January 5, 2015, WRAPmail and Prosperity Systems, Inc. (Prosperity) entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby WRAPmail acquired all outstanding shares of Prosperity in a one-for-one exchange of 36,354,077 shares. The WRAPmail shares were newly issued. In addition, 80,000,000 newly issued shares of WRAPmail were given to Prosperitys then CEO, Marco Alfonsi, for extinguishment of $22,250 of debt owed to him by Prosperity and services to be performed by Mr. Alfonsi to the Company. In connection with the share exchange, the Company then CEO retired 70,166,750 of WRAPmails outstanding stock and retired from his position as CEO but remained as chairman. Prosperitys CEO, Marco Alfonsi, became the Companys new CEO.

On October 29, 2015, the Company, pursuant to board resolution, elected to formally dissolve Prosperity Systems, Inc. and file its final tax return with the IRS, file articles of dissolution with the secretary of state, and transfer its net assets and operations to the Company as Prosperitys sole shareholder. This process has been initiated and is waiting on state approval to be complete. Prosperitys primary offering was its proprietary Software as a Service (SaaS) system called the Bullseye® Productivity Suite, which consolidates the most desired office productivity tools into one online experience accessible by registered users from anywhere. Bullseye is now operated directly by WRAPmail as a division of the Companys operations rather than within a subsidiary.


On January 23, 2017, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement (the Health Max Purchase Agreement) with Health Max Group, Inc. (Health Max) and the shareholders of Health Max (Shareholders). Pursuant to the Health Max Purchase Agreement, the Shareholders will sell all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Health Max (the Health Max Shares) to the Company in consideration for 700 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company. It was acknowledged and agreed that there would be a total of 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock authorized in WRAP, which preferred stock in the aggregate would be convertible into an aggregate of 87.5% of the Companys issued and outstanding common shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis as of the closing of the Health Max acquisition, with no other rights of privileges. The Company also agreed to change its name to HealthMax Group, Inc. and its trading symbol. The acquisition of Health Max was expected to close 70 days from execution of the Agreement. On April 6, 2017, the Company elected to terminate the Health Max Purchase Agreement. The termination was following the Companys due diligence investigations of Health Max and the determination that Health Max would not be the best acquisition target for the Company. 

Business 

WRAPmail, Inc. was formed in order to tap into a largely un-serviced segment of the web-based advertising industry. In July, 2015, WRAPmail, Inc. completed its acquisition of Prosperity Systems, Inc. Prosperitys primary offering was its proprietary Software as a Service (SaaS) system called the Bullseye® Productivity Suite, which consolidates the most desired office productivity tools into one online experience accessible by registered users from anywhere. More recently, the Company has taken steps to enter the into the cannabis industry. 

WRAPmail

The Company owns a patented technology that combines custom marketing content with organization e-mail to provide a next generation marketing platform for organizations and personal use. WRAPmail provides a branding and advertising solution to organizations allowing employee e-mails to be written on company sanctioned trackable e-mail stationary as opposed to using simple, personal e-mail signatures. In essence, WRAPmail turns every e-mail sent by one of our customers into valuable marketing tool by wrapping the e-mail with the customers letterhead, logo, product offerings, or other information or graphics that the customer wishes to disseminate to the reader. 

WRAPmail is a server/cloud‐ based solution. Users create e-mails just as they always have, and do not see the rich content. Users are not required to change their e‐mail address and the administrator can “construct” with or without the help of the WRAPmail Production & Design team different e‐mail letterheads using the included WRAPmaker that allow for including different graphics, links, promotions, surveys and/or audio. The e-mail either makes a stop after leaving the users desktop and that stop is where the e-mail gets wrapped or users use the available WRAPmail toolbars. Currently, toolbars are available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari and Firefox for Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOLMail, Microsoft Hotmail/LIVE, GoDaddy webmail, Keller Williams webmail, Salesforce.com webmail and 24sevenoffice.com webmail. WRAPmail software resides in the cloud or for large clients on their own server inside their Firewall. One WRAPmail server can currently process about 100K emails per hour (as we move to multi‐threading we believe we can increase the speed ten‐fold). WRAPmail has also developed an APP for Android and iPhone where users can send WRAPPED emails from their Gmail, Yahoo Mail, AOL Mail and Microsoft Mail.

As of August, 2016, the Company had over 4,000 clients using our WRAPmail products; however, most of these clients were using our free product and we have been only mildly successful in converting our free users to paying customers using our newest version, WRAPmail 2.0, a paid service with B2B and B2C offerings. This limited success in garnering new clients is despite numerous marketing efforts to the contrary and the Company has yet to find the best avenue for marketing WRAPmail 2.0 to potential clients. The Company continues to explore alternative avenues for generating revenues through its WRAPmail 2.0 product offering and intellectual property.

After substantial research, we are not aware of any competitors developing a similar solution to WRAPmail, possibly giving us first mover advantage. Nonetheless, we may face competition from stationary letterhead, bulk e-mail and similar product providers.

Transition into CBD Business

In or around the 4th quarter of 2016, the Companys CEO, Marco Alfonsi, began discussions with Health Max regarding a potential joint-venture between the parties. Health Max manufactures and distributes health and wellness products containing CBD derived from industrial, imported hemp. Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of nearly 85 naturally occurring compounds (cannabinoids) found in industrial hemp and cannabis. CBD is non-psychoactive and is thought to have numerous uses, including, but not limited to, for pain, insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, inflammation, and nausea. Unlike CBD derived from marijuana, CBD derived from the seeds and stalks of imported industrial hemp is generally considered legal in the U.S. so long as it contains less than 3% of THC, another, but psychoactive, cannabinoid found in cannabis. CBD derived from marijuana, marijuana and other marijuana derivatives are federally illegal in the U.S. despite being medically or recreationally legal in numerous states.

On January 13, 2017, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Health Max whereby the parties agreed to work towards developing a software system where cannabis can be tracked from seed to sale. Under the joint-venture, the Company is responsible for developing the software and Health Max is expected to actually track cannabis for clients using the software the Company develops. All revenue generated by the joint venture will be evenly split between WRAP and Health Max. 

After working with Health Max through the joint-venture and learning more about the potential health benefits of CBD and the cannabis industry in general, the Companys board of directors and shareholders representing a majority of the Companys voting stock elected to acquire Health Max in order to enter into the cannabis industry directly. While the Company has since terminated the Health Max Purchase Agreement and will be working with Health Max only through the software joint-venture, the Company intends to continue to pursue its entry into the CBD market through alternative acquisitions and/or licensing arrangements. No such opportunities are currently under negotiation; nonetheless, the Company has been exploring additional accretive acquisitions within the cannabis industry, with its focus on assets and opportunities relating to CBD products derived from industrial hemp.

The CBD and cannabis markets are flooded with competition ranging from mom and pop operations to multi-million dollar conglomerates, many with longer operating histories, more capital and/or more industry knowledge than the Company. The Company hopes to partner with or engage industry specialists to help set it apart from its numerous competitors. 

The statements found herein have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or medical condition.

While the Company is seeking additional opportunities to manufacture, market and/or distribute CBD, it continues to operate its Bullseye and WRAPmail divisions and explore ways to grow each, especially in a manner that would be symbiotic with its intended future CBD operation. 

Intellectual Property

We own the following patents for our WRAPmail technology: US patent no. 8572275 issued on October 29, 2013. This patent expires in October, 2033. On July 20, 2015 WRAPmail filed for a new patent under the title: Method, System and Software for Dynamically Extracting Content for Integration with Instant Messages.

Any expiration of our patents or claims would adversely affect our business. However, with regard to the importance and effect of these patents, it is necessary to understand the structure of the Companys intellectual property. Patents have been relied upon to discourage infringement during the research and development stage of the technology. In that sense we believe that the main purpose of the patents has been that they have served to provide the Company a head start against potential competitors. A significant body of unpublished know-how and trade secrets is closely held by the Company in order to mitigate the risk of competition that could arise from other parties reliance merely upon the information contained in the patents. The Company can derive revenue from sub-licensing its know-how without sub-licensing the rights to patents, or it can, as it has the right to do under the agreement, also sublicense the patents as well. 

Employees
 
The Company currently has one full-time employee.
