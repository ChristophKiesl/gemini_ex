Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PCs”), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within some of our content. The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the history of the formation of our Company, including our year and form of incorporation, refer to Part I, Item 1 “Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Merger Agreement
On January 18, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) and Anchorage Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft agreed to acquire the Company for $95.00 per issued and outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the “Shares”), in an all-cash transaction. On April 28, 2022, the Company’s stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement at a special meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), the Company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”). We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we or Microsoft will be required to pay a termination fee. We will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of approximately $2.27 billion under specified circumstances, including termination of the Merger Agreement due to our material breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement. Microsoft will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee under specified circumstances, including termination of the Merger Agreement due to a permanent injunction arising from Antitrust Laws (as defined in the Merger Agreement) when we are not then in material breach of any provision of the Merger Agreement and if certain other conditions are met, in an amount equal to (1) $2.5 billion if the termination notice is provided prior to April 18, 2023, or (2) $3.0 billion if the termination notice is provided at any time after April 18, 2023. 
The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals. On December 8, 2022, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued an administrative complaint against the Company and Microsoft alleging that the Company and Microsoft executed the Merger Agreement in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45, which, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 18 and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 45. The Company filed an answer to the FTC’s administrative complaint on December 22, 2022, and thereafter filed an amended answer on January 4, 2023. The administrative trial is currently scheduled to take place before an FTC administrative law judge starting August 2, 2023.
The two parties are continuing to engage with regulators reviewing the proposed transaction and are working toward closing in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.
For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 21, 2022, as supplemented by the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 15, 2022, and other relevant materials in connection with the proposed transaction with Microsoft that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about the Company and the Merger.
China License Agreements
Activision Blizzard had licensing agreements with NetEase, Inc. (“NetEase”) covering the publication of several Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. titles in Mainland China. These agreements, which contributed approximately 3% of Activision Blizzard’s consolidated net revenues in both 2021 and 2022, expired in January 2023.
Activision Blizzard is committed to finding alternative ways to serve the community in Mainland China affected by the expiry of these agreements. The co-development and publishing of Diablo® Immortal™ is covered by a separate agreement with NetEase, which remains in place. In addition, Call of Duty®: Mobile is governed by agreements with another third party that are unaffected.
Our Strategy and Vision
Our objective is to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment. We are a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, delivering engaging entertainment experiences to our network of connected players on a year-round basis. In pursuit of our objective, we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; deepening consumer engagement; and increasing player investment.
Expanding audience reach. Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling content is at the core of our business. We endeavor to expand our network and reach as many consumers as possible by offering our content on multiple platforms, particularly mobile, the largest and fastest growing platform, and delivering compelling experiences across multiple business models (e.g., premium, free-to-play, subscription-based).
Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games to provide a depth of content that offers consumers the opportunity to engage for a long period of time following a game’s release. In addition, our games are designed to provide players the ability to connect with each other socially within our communities, thus delivering more value to our players and providing additional growth opportunities for our games.
Increasing player investment. The connected, online nature of our network enables us to offer content and player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in our games by purchasing incremental in-game content. These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. In addition, we generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our games.
Our Segments
Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, each of which is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services based primarily on our internally-developed intellectual properties.
(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.
Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision’s key product offerings include titles and content for Call of Duty, a first-person action franchise. Activision also includes the activities of the Call of Duty League™, a global professional esports league.
(ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.
Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales, subscriptions, and by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming platform, Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard’s key product offerings include titles and content for: the Warcraft® franchise, which includes World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game, and Hearthstone®, an online collectible card game based in the Warcraft universe; Diablo® in the action role-playing genre; and Overwatch® in the team-based first-person action genre. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League™, a global professional esports league.
(iii) King Digital Entertainment
King Digital Entertainment (“King”) delivers content through free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from in-game sales and in-game advertising on mobile platforms. King’s key product offerings include titles and content for Candy Crush™, a “match three” franchise.
Other
We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including our Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
Products
We develop interactive entertainment content and services, principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games primarily through digital distribution channels. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and “match three,” among others. We primarily offer the following products and services:
•premium full-games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;
•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;
•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e., microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our premium full-games and free-to-play offerings;
•subscriptions for players in World of Warcraft that provide for ongoing access to the game content; and
•advertising services for third-party companies to reach and engage with our players, primarily within our free-to-play offerings.
Providing additional content and experiences within franchises has increased opportunities for player investment outside of premium full-game purchases. This has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more consistently recurring and year-round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement with our games and content.
Product Development and Support
We focus on developing wholly-owned intellectual properties backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We aim to build interactive entertainment content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement, and year-round player investment. It is our experience that established intellectual properties then serve as the basis for related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the development and distribution of products and content based on established franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of content based on our owned intellectual properties in the future, and in recent years have increased the size of our development teams, a trend that we expect to continue, but at more moderated levels.
We develop and produce our titles using a model in which individual game studios have primary responsibility for the development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, including by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.
While most of our content is developed by our internal studios, we also engage independent third-party developers to create content on our behalf. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-party developers.
We provide various forms of support to our game studios when developing a product. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and in an effort to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players, primarily online.
Marketing, Sales, and Distribution
Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also include: activities on online social networks; other online advertising; public relations activities; print and broadcast advertising; coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays); participation in cooperative advertising programs; direct response vehicles; and product sampling. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners.
Our game products and content are generally available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”), Google Inc. (“Google”), Microsoft, Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“Sony”), and Valve Corporation (“Valve”). Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming platform, Battle.net, to distribute most of Blizzard’s content and selected Activision content directly to PC consumers.
In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching, and digital content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of which of our games on Battle.net they are playing.
Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses, game specialty stores, and other stores, or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements.
Manufacturing
We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for consoles, such as for Microsoft and Sony, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned by us.
Microsoft and Sony generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to us. In return, we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.
Significant Customers and Our Franchises
Customers
While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through Battle.net, in other instances our content is distributed to end consumers via platform providers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Sony, and Valve, or retailers, such as Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. 
Customers and platform providers exceeding 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues and consolidated gross receivables were approximately as follows:

 | For the Years Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Net Revenues: | | | | | 
Apple Inc. | 20 | % | | 17 | % | | 15 | %
Google Inc. | 18 | % | | 17 | % | | 14 | %
Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. | 13 | % | | 15 | % | | 17 | %
Microsoft Corporation | * | | * | | 11 | %
 | At December 31, | | 
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 
Gross Receivables: | | | | | 
Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. | 22 | % | | 22 | % | | 
Microsoft Corporation | 20 | % | | 20 | % | | 
Google Inc. | 10 | % | | * | | 

*    Did not account for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues or consolidated gross receivables for the noted periods. 
Our Franchises
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our three franchises—Call of Duty, Warcraft, and Candy Crush—collectively accounted for 79%, 82%, and 79%, respectively, of our net revenues. No other games or content outside of these franchises comprised 10% or more of our net revenues in those periods.
Competition
We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies and software competitors, as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music, and other consumer products.
The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive, and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price of content; marketing support; and quality of customer service.
In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms, while at the same time acting as key distribution channels and payment gateways for our products and services through their digital storefronts. Apple and Google are similarly positioned on mobile devices. 
As our teams have contributed to transforming gaming into social experiences, enabling players to find purpose and meaning through games, we believe connecting these communities together is the next step in our industry. This can be seen by established and emerging competitors seeing opportunity for virtual worlds filled with professionally produced content, user generated content and rich social connections. As investments in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data analytics, and user interface and experience capabilities are becoming more competitive, we believe that our proposed Merger with Microsoft will better enable our ambitions in this dynamic and highly competitive environment. 
Intellectual Property
Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear, and interact with when they are playing our games.
We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, Warcraft, and Candy Crush. In other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from other providers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.
We are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education programs, and legislative activity around the world. For our PC products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.
Our People
Our continued success is directly related to our ability to attract, recruit, enable, retain, and develop diverse and exceptional talent. In this section, we provide information about our employees, our initiatives to provide opportunities to further develop careers and enhance the experience of our employees, our commitment to excellence, diversity, equity and inclusion, and related employment matters.
Overview: As of December 31, 2022, Activision Blizzard had approximately 13,000 full-time and part-time non-temporary employees, with approximately 72% in North America, approximately 22% in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) region, and approximately 6% in the Asia Pacific region. Of these employees, approximately 69% either work directly on, or support, our game and technology development.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”): We believe that a diverse, inclusive culture committed to excellence and measured by performance enables us to capitalize on the strengths of our workforce to exceed players’ and fans’ expectations and meet our business objectives. We remain committed to building and sustaining a welcoming, inclusive culture through DE&I practices and programs throughout the employee experience.
Our Corporate Governance Principles and Policies demonstrate our commitment to diversity at the Board of Directors level, providing that the initial list from which any new independent director nominee is chosen includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. Similarly, when we recruit new senior leadership we expect candidate slates at the vice president level and above to be diverse, and aim to recruit diverse candidates across the Company. During 2022, we increased the percentage of women on our Board of Directors from 20% to 33%. Further, as of December 31, 2022, 22% of our Board of Directors are members of underrepresented communities.
In 2021, in connection with our announcement by our CEO, Mr. Kotick, of Transformational Goals for our organization, we committed to increase the percentage of women and non-binary employees by 50% by October 2026. Further, our required training programs underscore our commitment to maintaining a respectful workplace culture. For example, every employee is required to take our online “Way2Play” Training, which covers a wide range of ethics and compliance topics, including workplace respect. In 2022, we required all U.S. employees to be trained on our new Workplace Integrity Policy, to help ensure a culture free of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. This training will be expanded to non-U.S. based employees in 2023. This policy, along with mandatory live training, aims to ensure that all employees understand their responsibilities with respect to conduct that can detract from a welcoming, respectful workplace committed to excellence. We also offer leadership and management development opportunities on the topics of unconscious bias and inclusive leadership, and train our recruiting workforce in diverse sourcing strategies.
Our overall goal in hiring is to provide an objective and equitable process that helps us recruit the very best talent we can find and we utilize an array of resources and tools aimed at ensuring women, underrepresented ethnic groups (“UEGs”), and other diverse employees are appropriately represented in our workforce. We believe a diverse workforce allows us to better serve our players in almost 200 countries and creates a more inspiring culture that fosters creativity and innovation.
We continually invest in tools and systems that allow us to better track representation of women and UEG candidates at the applicant, interview, and hiring stages of our recruiting processes, helping to reinforce our goal of having diverse candidate slates for open positions. As of November 30, 2022, approximately 26% of our global employee population identifies as women or non-binary, up from approximately 24% in November 2021. Representation for UEGs in the U.S. was approximately 38% as of November 30, 2022, up from approximately 36% in November 2021.
We have invested in additional initiatives–from expanding opportunities in the gaming and technology space for underrepresented communities to mentorship and sponsorship programs for our current teammates and future leaders. In 2021, in connection with our Transformational Goals (described further below under the heading “Actions to Enhance Our Workplace Experience”), we committed to invest $250 million over the following ten years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for underrepresented communities. Additionally, our work to support the Call of Duty Endowment in 2022 resulted in 15,987 veteran job placements and more than $1 billion in positive economic impact for the veteran community.
Compensation and Benefits: The main objective of our compensation program is to provide compensation that attracts, retains, motivates, and rewards employees who operate with excellence in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking compensation (including annual changes in compensation) to overall Company and business unit/franchise performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align our employees’ incentives with the interests of our shareholders. We continue to make efforts across our global organization to promote equal pay practices, as demonstrated by the disclosure of our Global Pay Equity Review for 2021 results in our most recent annual Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”) report. Further, we have announced improved benefits such as increased holiday, wellness, and vacation time off.
We always endeavor to offer benefits that enable our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Examples include: 401(k) with matching Company contributions; a comprehensive well-being program; paid leave programs; medical insurance; prescription drug benefits; dental insurance; vision insurance; accidental death and dismemberment insurance; critical illness insurance; life insurance; disability insurance; health savings accounts; flexible spending accounts; and benefits to support current and hopeful parents. We frequently upgrade our benefit portfolio by seeking out pioneer partners that give our employees unique and supportive benefit experiences. A more comprehensive list of our benefits can be found at https://benefitsforeveryworld.com (this corporate website, and the contents thereof, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K nor deemed filed with the SEC).
In 2021, the Company reviewed our compensation and incentive programs and implemented changes to our compensation to enhance employee equity ownership and align our equity compensation practices more closely with industry peers. As a result of this review, the Company made changes to our bonus and equity programs so that all eligible employees received all or a portion of certain incentives in the form of Company equity for 2021. Similarly, for 2022 the Company is expecting to deliver certain of its annual performance plans in the form of Company equity to further align the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders.
Developing Careers and Growing Leaders: Recognizing that ours is a rapidly changing industry with a requirement for constant innovation, developing our talent base is vital to our continued success. Our talent processes are focused on career and leadership development opportunities through promotion and internal mobility, performance management, and strategic talent assessment and succession planning. In order to ensure a continuing commitment to excellence and a recognition that performance is a prerequisite to sustained success, we try to ensure our employees have a clear understanding of their strengths and development opportunities. We believe this transparency in communication fosters a collaborative and productive relationship between employees and their managers. Our performance management process begins with the establishment of goals, followed by encouraged regular check-ins on progress and performance so that employees have an understanding of their strengths, areas for improvement, and how they are contributing to the success of the Company. We assess employee contributions to our Company results and culture so that we can recognize and reward their contributions. Additionally, on an annual basis, we conduct an organizational health and performance review process with our senior leadership and segment, business, franchise, and function leaders, focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diversity and inclusion, and the performance and succession for our most critical roles.
Engaging Employees: Employees across the Company have the opportunity to join and contribute to one of our nine Employee Network Groups (“ENGs”). These groups enrich our employees’ experiences, our culture, and our business by driving inclusion, cultural awareness, professional development, networking, and community involvement. Employee engagement also plays a critical role in how we identify and improve the way we work. We capture and act on the voice of our employees through multiple means, including pulse surveys, listening sessions and Upward Feedback, an annual process through which employees share constructive actionable feedback to their managers through an anonymous survey, enabling awareness regarding managers’ inclusive behaviors and commitment to living our values. Through this process we encourage our employees to provide honest, candid feedback about their experiences working for the Company. This process enables us to provide an enriching, rewarding experience for our employees. In 2022, we had 90% of eligible managers receive feedback and overall positive ratings increased across the Company, and within each business unit, as compared to the prior year.
Actions to Enhance Our Workplace Experience: The Company regularly introduces new initiatives to enhance our culture and ensure a welcoming, inclusive, diverse workplace committed to excellence. Continuing to provide a model workplace in our industry remains a priority for the Company.
On October 28, 2021, Mr. Kotick announced transformational workplace excellence goals and practices (collectively, the “Transformational Goals”). As part of our workplace excellence goals, we accomplished the following in 2022:
•In furtherance of our goal to increase the percentage of women and non-binary individuals by 50% over the next five years – We have made meaningful progress. As of November 30, 2022, approximately 26% of our global employee population identifies as women or non-binary, up from approximately 24% in November 2021, and up from approximately 23% at the time the goal was announced.
•Investing $250 million over the next ten years to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent – As part of this commitment, in 2022 we launched Level-Up U, a three-month training program for engineers seeking to launch their careers in the gaming industry. For the inaugural class of Level-Up U engineers, over 100 offers to program applicants were accepted, with a 73% rate of overall diversity, including 45% women and non-binary individuals and 40% from UEGs.
•In furtherance of our zero tolerance policies with respect to certain types of workplace conduct – We significantly expanded our Ethics and Compliance resources to increase our ability to conduct faster investigations and ensure greater consistency across investigations of all types across the Company. In 2022, we added 26 Ethics and Compliance professionals and we have quadrupled the size of the Ethics and Compliance team since July 2021.
•Increasing visibility on pay equity – Since the announcement of this commitment, we have shared the results of our U.S. Pay Equity Review 2020 and Global Pay Equity Review for 2021, which highlight that, after accounting for factors that impact pay like role, location, tenure, and job classification, in the U.S., women at the Company on average earned slightly more than men at the Company for comparable work in 2020 (women received approximately one dollar and one cent for every dollar received by men), and globally, women and those who do not identify as men at the Company on average earned one dollar for every dollar received by men at the Company for comparable work in 2021. We also included a median pay analysis in our 2021 ESG Report and published our EEO-1 Report.
In connection with the announcement of the Transformational Goals, in October 2021, Mr. Kotick requested that his compensation be reduced to the lowest amount permitted to be paid to exempt employees under California law. Consistent with this request, Mr. Kotick’s base salary for 2022 was $62,500 and he did not receive any equity awards or bonus payments.
Our Board of Directors’ Workplace Responsibility Committee, formed in November 2021, has been engaged in overseeing the Company’s progress in successfully implementing its workplace excellence policies, procedures, and commitments. The Workplace Responsibility Committee requires management to develop key performance indicators and/or other means to measure progress and ensure accountability, with executive management providing frequent progress reports to the Workplace Responsibility Committee, which regularly briefs the full Board of Directors. Any changes to Mr. Kotick’s annual and long-term compensation will only occur after a determination by the Workplace Responsibility Committee of appropriate progress toward the achievement of our workplace excellence objectives.
Unionization: Our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, in May 2022, a small group of quality assurance workers at our Raven Software studio in Wisconsin voted in favor of forming a union with the Communication Workers of America (the “CWA”). In December 2022, a small group of quality assurance workers for Blizzard in New York also voted in favor of forming a union with the CWA. On December 27, 2022, the Proletariat studio in Boston, which was recently acquired by Blizzard, announced the formation of a union and the CWA filed a petition for union representation with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”). The NLRB announced that the mail ballot election would be scheduled to begin January 24, 2023; however, the CWA withdrew its petition on January 24, 2023. We deeply respect the rights of all employees to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union and exercise all other National Labor Relations Act rights. Across the Company, we believe that a direct relationship between managers and team members allows us to quickly respond and deliver the strongest results and the greatest opportunities and incentives for employees. As discussed in Part I, Item 1A under “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are also subject to certain interim covenants with respect to various matters (including, among other things, with respect to collective bargaining agreements and employee benefit plans) concerning the operation of our business during the pendency of the Merger.
Workplace legal matters and related risks: For information regarding legal actions against the Company regarding workplace concerns and related matters, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sustainability
We have a responsibility to operate sustainably. We have established and disclosed Scopes 1, 2 and estimated Scope 3 emissions and are developing a roadmap to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in accordance with the Science Based Targets Initiative Corporate Net-Zero Standard. Our rapid conversion towards a fully digital business is enabling us to set and achieve important sustainability goals. As a result of our focus and progress thus far, we have reduced packaging waste by 70% as compared to our baseline year of 2019, surpassing our original ambitious goal of a 50% reduction by 2024. 
Long Term Total Shareholder Return
The below total shareholder returns (“TSR”) information is provided to illustrate the comparison of the Company’s long term TSR to the identified peers and index. Other performance measures are included in Part II, Item 5 under “Stock Performance Graph” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Over the 10 years ended December 31, 2022, the Company delivered an average annual TSR of 23%, ahead of the peer group median of 18% and significantly ahead of the S&P 500 at 10%.
