Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
When used in this Form 10-K, “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to Spartan Motors, Inc. and, depending on the context, could also be used to refer generally to the Company and its subsidiaries, which are described below.
 
General
 
Spartan Motors, Inc. was organized as a Michigan corporation on September 18, 1975, and is headquartered in Charlotte, Michigan. Spartan Motors began development of its first product that same year and shipped its first fire truck chassis in October 1975.
 
We are known as a leading, niche market engineer and manufacturer in the heavy-duty, custom vehicles marketplace. Our operating activities are conducted through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Spartan Motors USA, Inc. (“Spartan USA”), with locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; and Bristol, Indiana, along with contract manufacturing in Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico. In addition, as a result of a recent acquisition described below, we now also have facilities in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin; and a second location in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.
 
We recently completed a corporate reorganization. On July 1, 2015, our former Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Charlotte, Michigan location) and our former Crimson Fire Aerials, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Ephrata, Pennsylvania location) were merged into Spartan USA. On January 1, 2016, our former Utilimaster Corporation subsidiary (which operated our Bristol and Wakarusa, Indiana locations) was also merged into Spartan USA. These transactions were primarily completed in order to consolidate our U.S. operations into a single subsidiary and to simplify our corporate structure.
 
Our Charlotte, Michigan location manufactures heavy duty chassis and vehicles and supplies aftermarket parts and accessories under the Spartan Chassis and Spartan ERV brand names. Our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations manufacture emergency response vehicles under the Spartan ERV brand name, while our Bristol, Indiana location manufactures vehicles used in the parcel delivery, mobile retail and trades and construction industries, and supplies related aftermarket parts and services under the Utilimaster brand name. Our Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico locations sell and install equipment used in fleet vehicles. Spartan USA is also a participant in Spartan-Gimaex Innovations, LLC (“Spartan-Gimaex”), a 50/50 joint venture with Gimaex Holding, Inc. that was formed to provide emergency response vehicles for the domestic and international markets. Spartan-Gimaex is reported as a consolidated subsidiary of Spartan Motors, Inc. In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. In February 2017, by agreement of the parties, the court proceeding was dismissed with prejudice and the judge entered an order to this effect as the parties agreed to seek a dissolution plan on their own. No dissolution terms have been determined as of the date of this Form 10-K. 
 
On January 1, 2017, Spartan USA acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Smeal Fire Apparatus Co., Smeal Properties, Inc., Ladder Tower Co., and U.S. Tanker Co. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Smeal” refers to the assets, liabilities, and operations acquired from such entities. The assets acquired consist of the assets used by the former owners of Smeal in the operation of its business designing, manufacturing, and distributing emergency response vehicle bodies and aerial devices for the fire service industry. Smeal has operations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania and will be operated as part of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment.
 
Our business strategy is to further diversify product lines and develop innovative design, engineering and manufacturing expertise in order to be the best value producer of custom vehicle products. Our diversification across several sectors provides numerous opportunities while reducing overall risk. Additionally, our business model provides the agility to quickly respond to market needs, take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size operations to ensure stability and growth.
We have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with our customers. This is accomplished by striving to deliver premium custom vehicles, vehicle components, and services. We believe we can best carry out our long-term business plan and obtain optimal financial flexibility by using a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities, as well as internally or externally generated equity capital, as sources of expansion capital.
Our Segments
 
We identify our reportable segments based on our management structure and the financial data utilized by our chief operating decision makers to assess segment performance and allocate resources among our operating units. We have three reportable segments: Emergency Response Vehicles, Fleet Vehicles and Services, and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles. For certain financial information related to each segment, see Note 16, Business Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Emergency Response Vehicles Segment
 
Our Emergency Response Vehicles segment consists of the emergency response chassis and vehicle operations at our Charlotte, Michigan location and the Spartan ERV operations at our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations, along with our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. Beginning in 2017, the Spartan ERV operations will also include the Smeal operations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska, Delavan, Wisconsin and Ephrata, Pennsylvania. This segment engineers and manufactures emergency response chassis, emergency response bodies and aerial equipment, and distributes related aftermarket parts and accessories. The emergency response chassis operations of Spartan USA involve the design and manufacture of custom chassis for emergency response vehicles. Our Spartan ERV division specializes in the manufacture of aerial ladders and emergency response vehicle bodies which are mounted on custom chassis manufactured by Spartan, commercial chassis or other custom chassis. Sales from the Emergency Response Vehicles segment represented 31.0%, 35.1% and 37.5% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 
The Emergency Response Vehicles segment has extensive engineering experience in creating custom vehicles that perform specialized tasks, and generally manufactures vehicles only upon receipt of confirmed purchase orders; thus, it does not have significant amounts of completed product inventory. As an emergency response vehicle producer, Spartan Motors believes it holds a unique position for continued growth due to its engineering reaction time, manufacturing expertise and flexibility. The addition of Smeal will place Spartan among the four largest North American fire apparatus manufacturers. Spartan Motors markets its emergency response vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as in select markets in South America and Asia. The Emergency Response Vehicles segment employed 1,080 associates in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin and Ephrata, Pennsylvania as of January 31, 2017, 4 of which were contracted employees. 
 

Emergency Response Chassis
 
We custom manufacture emergency response chassis in response to customer specifications through our Spartan USA subsidiary. These specifications vary based on such factors as application, terrain, street configuration and the nature of the community, state or country in which the fire truck will be utilized. We have four fire truck models within this product line: (1) the “Gladiator” chassis; (2) the “Metro Star” chassis; (3) the “Metro Star X” chassis and (4) the “Metro Star RT” (rescue transport).
We strive to develop innovative engineering solutions to meet customer requirements, and design new products anticipating the future needs of the marketplace. We regularly introduce new vehicle systems and components that incrementally improve the level of product performance, reliability, and safety for vehicle occupants. We monitor the availability of new technology and work closely with our component manufacturers to apply new technology to our products. 
 
Over the past few years, Spartan USA has introduced innovations on our emergency response chassis such as: our Spartan Select and 180 truck programs, designed to provide the custom apparatus that emergency response professionals need with unprecedented order-to-delivery cycle times as short as 180 days; our Intelligent Backup Camera system, which can distinguish moving from stationary objects and detect when the apparatus is in close proximity to a wall, another truck or a person; Mobile Gateway, which provides an extensive group of connectivity features - even if the communications infrastructure is compromised or down; heated roll down side glass; optimized engine tunnel; and a new fire truck cab interior configuration, which provides additional space and comfort in both the driver and officer positions, improved shoulder harness accessibility, increased interior volume and a 45% reduction in in-cab noise levels when traveling at 45 mph.
 

Emergency Response Vehicles
 
We engineer and manufacture emergency response vehicles and apparatus utilizing custom and commercial chassis through our Spartan USA subsidiary. We market these products through a network of dealers throughout North America, and in select markets in South America and Asia under the Spartan ERV brand and, beginning in 2017 under the Smeal, Ladder Tower Company and U.S. Tanker brands. Our product lines include pumpers and aerial fire apparatus, heavy- and light-duty rescue units, tankers and quick attack units. We are recognized in the industry for our innovative design and engineering, with signature features such as Tubular Stainless Steel body structure (known as the Tri-MaxTM body frame), Vibra-TorqTM mounting system, and Smart Access pump panels that are designed to offer the safety, reliability and durability that firefighters need to get the job done.

Aerial Ladders
 
We engineer, manufacture and market aerial ladder components for fire trucks under the Spartan ERV brand and, beginning in 2017 through our Smeal and Ladder Tower Company brands. Our aerial products are produced through our Spartan USA operations in Snyder, Nebraska and Ephrata, Pennsylvania, which have developed a full line of aerial products. 
Aftermarket Parts and Accessories
 
The aftermarket parts and accessories operation of Spartan USA supplies aftermarket repair parts and accessories along with limited servicing and refurbishment for our products in the emergency response vehicles market.
Fleet Vehicles and Services Segment
 
We manufacture fleet vehicles used in the parcel delivery, mobile retail, and trades and construction industries through our Bristol, Indiana operations. Our fleet vehicles are marketed under the Utilimaster brand name, which serves a diverse customer base and also sells aftermarket parts and accessories and customer specific up-fit equipment for walk-in vans and other delivery vehicles. Sales from our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment represented 47.1%, 41.4% and 41.5% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment employed 920 associates at our Bristol, Indiana facility, as of January 31, 2017, of which 78 were contracted employees.
Our Fleet Vehicles and Services sales and distribution efforts are designed to sell to national, fleet and commercial dealer accounts within these niches under the Aeromaster®, Trademaster®, Metromaster® and Utilivan® brand names. We market our fleet vehicles throughout the U.S. and Canada. 
 
The principal types of commercial vehicles we manufacture are walk-in vans, cutaway vans and truck bodies. Walk-in vans are assembled on a “stripped” truck chassis supplied with engine and drive train components, but without a cab. Walk-in vans are sold under the Aeromaster® brand, and are typically used in multi-stop applications that include the delivery of packages, the distribution of food products and the delivery of uniforms/linens. Cutaway vans are installed on “cutaway” van chassis, and are sold under the Utilimaster, Utilivan®, Metromaster® and Trademaster® brand names. Cutaway bodies are primarily used for local delivery of parcels, freight and perishable food. Truck bodies are installed on a chassis that is supplied with a finished cab. Our truck bodies are typically fabricated with pre-painted panels, aerodynamic front and side corners, hardwood floors and various door configurations to accommodate end-user loading and unloading requirements. Our truck bodies are sold under the Utilimaster brand name and are used for diversified dry freight transportation. In addition to vehicles, our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment sells aftermarket parts and accessories for its walk-in vans and truck bodies and sells and installs up-fit equipment for walk-in vans and other delivery vehicles. In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, interior equipment up fitting and aftermarket parts sales represented 25.9%, 14.9% and 10.2% of the Fleet Vehicles and Services segment sales.
 
 
Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment
 
Our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment consists of our Charlotte, Michigan operations that engineer and manufacture motor home chassis, defense vehicles and other specialty chassis and distribute related aftermarket parts and accessories. Our specialty vehicle products are manufactured to customer specifications upon receipt of confirmed purchase orders. As a specialty chassis and vehicle manufacturer, we believe we hold a unique position for continued growth due to the high quality and performance of our products, our engineering reaction time, manufacturing expertise and flexibility. Our specialty vehicle products are generally sold through original equipment manufacturers in the case of chassis and vehicles and to dealer distributors or directly to consumers for aftermarket parts and accessories. Sales from our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment represented 21.9%, 23.5% and 21.0% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment employed 323 associates (all in Charlotte, Michigan) as of January 31, 2017, of which 37 were contracted employees. 
 
Motor Home Chassis
 
We custom manufacture chassis to the individual specifications of our motor home original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers through our Spartan USA subsidiary. These specifications vary based on specific interior and exterior design specifications, power requirements, horsepower and electrical needs of the motor home bodies to be attached to the Spartan chassis. Spartan USA’s motor home chassis are separated into four models: the “K1”, “K2”, “K3”, and “K4” series chassis.
 
 5



Versions of these four basic product models are designed and engineered in order to meet customer requirements. This allows the chassis to be adapted to the specific floor plan and manufacturing process used by the OEM. We seek to develop innovative engineering solutions to meet our customer’s requirements and strive to anticipate future market needs by working closely with OEMs and listening to end users. We monitor the availability of new technology and work closely with our component manufacturers to apply new technology to our products. Over the past few years we have introduced new innovations, including: the Spartan Advanced Protection System, the industry's first comprehensive safety system which brings automotive grade safety features to the Class A RV market; the Spartan Mobile Gateway, which allows Spartan chassis the ability to maintain redundant cell network connections or satellite connectivity; Spartan Connected Care, which provides owners of RVs built on Spartan chassis with instant access to coach-specific diagnostic codes, maintenance schedules, and an interactive map to pinpoint which of Spartan’s more than 250 RV-specific authorized service centers is closest; electronic steering control; heavy duty air ride independent front suspension; and multiplexed electrical controls. 

Specialty Vehicle Chassis
 
Through our Spartan USA subsidiary, we develop specialized chassis to unique customer requirements and actively seek additional applications of our existing products and technology in the specialty vehicle market. Over the past few years we have expanded into highly customized niche markets for specialty vehicle chassis, including high power/high capability drill rigs, specialty bus applications and assembly of the Isuzu N-Series Gasoline Cab-Forward Trucks, a direct result of our alliance with Isuzu Commercial Truck of America.
Aftermarket Parts and Accessories
 
The aftermarket parts and accessories operation of Spartan USA supplies aftermarket repair parts and sub-assemblies along with limited servicing and refurbishment for our products in the defense and motor home markets.
Marketing
 
We market our specialty vehicles, including custom emergency response chassis, emergency response bodies and other specialty vehicles, throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as select markets in South America and Asia, primarily through the direct contact of our sales department with OEMs, dealers and end users. We utilize dealer organizations that establish close working relationships through their sales departments with end users. These personal contacts focus on the quality of the group’s specialty products and allow us to keep customers updated on new and improved product lines and end users’ needs.
We sell delivery vehicles, including walk-in vans, cutaway vans and truck bodies, to commercial vehicle dealers, leasing companies and directly to end-users. We also market our delivery vehicles directly to several national and fleet accounts (national accounts typically have 1,000+ vehicle fleets and fleet accounts typically have 100+ vehicle fleets), and through a network of independent truck dealers in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in Canada. We provide aftermarket support, including parts sales and field service, to all of our delivery vehicle customers through our Customer Service Department located in Bristol, Indiana, which maintains the only online parts resource among the major delivery vehicle manufacturers. Except in limited circumstances, we do not provide financing to dealers, fleet or national accounts. We also maintain multi-year supply agreements with certain key fleet customers in the parcel and linen/uniform rental industries.
In 2016 and consistent with prior years, our representatives attended trade shows, rallies and expositions throughout North America as well as Europe and Asia to promote our products. Trade shows provide the opportunity to display products and to meet directly with OEMs who purchase chassis, dealers who sell finished vehicles and consumers who buy the finished products. Participation in these events also allows us to better identify what customers and end users are looking for in the future. We use these events to create a competitive advantage by relaying this information back to our advanced product development team for future projects.
Our sales and marketing team is responsible for promoting and selling our manufactured goods and producing product literature. The sales group consists of approximately 40 salespeople based in Company locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; and Bristol, Indiana, with additional salespeople located throughout North America.

Competition
 
The principal methods we use to build competitive advantages include short engineering reaction time, custom design capability, high product quality, superior customer service and quick delivery. We compete with companies that manufacture for similar markets, including some divisions of large diversified organizations that have total sales and financial resources exceeding ours. Certain competitors are vertically integrated and manufacture their own chassis and/or apparatuses, although they generally do not sell their chassis to outside customers (other OEMs). Our direct competitors in the emergency vehicle apparatus market are principally smaller manufacturers. Our competition in the delivery vehicle market comes from a small number of manufacturers. 
 
Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, we are unable to state with certainty our position in most of our markets compared to our competitors. The emergency vehicle market and, to a lesser degree, the custom chassis market are fragmented. We believe that no one company has a dominant position in either of those markets. We are a leading manufacturer of walk-in vans in the United States, and believe we have a market share of approximately 50% in this market. The cutaway and truck body markets are highly fragmented, making the determination of our market share difficult. However, we believe we are one of the top five manufacturers of these products in the United States.
 

Manufacturing
 
Through December 31, 2016, we manufactured our products in four locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Bristol, Indiana; Brandon, South Dakota; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania. On January 1, 2017 we completed our acquisition of Smeal, which includes manufacturing locations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska, Delavan, Wisconsin and Ephrata, Pennsylvania.
 
At our Charlotte, Michigan location, we manufacture custom emergency response chassis, emergency response vehicles, motor home and other specialty chassis and assemble Isuzu N-Series gasoline cab-forward trucks for Isuzu and General Motors Corp. With the exception of the Isuzu N-Series trucks, our products are assembled on non-automated assembly lines owing to the custom nature of the products. Generally, we design, engineer and assemble our specialized heavy-duty truck chassis using primarily commercially available components purchased from outside suppliers. This approach facilitates prompt serviceability of finished products, reduces production costs, expedites the development of new products and reduces the potential of costly down time for the end user.
 
At our Bristol, Indiana location, we manufacture walk-in vans, truck bodies and cutaway vans on an assembly line utilizing a commercial truck chassis and engineered structural components, such as floors, roofs, and wall panels. After assembly, we install optional equipment and finishes based on customer specifications. 
At our Brandon, South Dakota, Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska and Delavan, Wisconsin locations, we manufacture emergency response vehicles, utilizing either a Spartan chassis sourced from our Charlotte, Michigan facility or a custom or commercial chassis sourced from another manufacturer. At our Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations, we manufacture aerial ladder structures that are assembled on a Spartan or other manufacturer’s custom chassis. These facilities do not use automated assembly lines since each vehicle is manufactured to meet specifications of an end user-customized order. The chassis is rolled down the production line as other components are added and connected. The body is manufactured at the facility with components such as pumps, tanks, and electrical control units purchased from outside suppliers.
Suppliers
 
We are dedicated to establishing long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers. Through these relationships, we benefit from new innovations, higher quality, reduced lead times, smoother/faster manufacturing ramp-up of new vehicle introductions and lower total costs of doing business. The combined buying power of our subsidiaries and a corporate supply chain management initiative allow us to benefit from economies of scale and to focus on a common vision.
 
The single largest commodity directly utilized in production is aluminum, which we purchase under purchase agreements based on forecasted production requirements. To a lesser extent we are dependent upon suppliers of lumber, fiberglass and steel for our manufacturing. We have no significant long-term material supply contracts. There are several readily available sources for the majority of these raw materials. However, we are heavily dependent on specific component part products from a few single source vendors. We maintain a qualification, on-site inspection, assistance, and performance measurement system to control risks associated with reliance on suppliers. We normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials or components in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. Material and component cost increases are passed on to our customers whenever possible. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be any supply issues over the long-term.
 
In the assembly of delivery vehicles, we use chassis supplied by third parties, and generally do not purchase these chassis for inventory. For this market, we typically accept shipment of truck chassis owned by dealers or end users, for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing our specialized commercial vehicles on such chassis. In the event of a labor disruption or other uncontrollable event adversely affecting the limited number of companies that manufacture and/or deliver such commercial truck chassis, our level of manufacturing could be substantially reduced.

Research and Development
 Our success depends on our ability to respond quickly to changing market demands and new regulatory requirements. Thus, we emphasize research and development and commit significant resources to develop and adapt new products and production techniques. We dedicate a portion of our facilities to research and development projects and focus on implementing the latest technology from component manufacturers into existing products and manufacturing prototypes of new product lines. We spent $6.8 million, $4.6 million and $3.9 million on research and development in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Beginning in 2015, certain engineering costs related to routine product changes that were formerly classified within Research and development expense have been classified within Cost of products sold on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in order to more consistently align the results of our individual business units. Expenses of $7.8 million for 2014 have been reclassified accordingly.
Product Warranties
 
We provide limited warranties against assembly and construction defects. These warranties generally provide for the replacement or repair of defective parts or workmanship for specified periods, ranging from one year to the life of the product, following the date of sale. The end users also may receive limited warranties from suppliers of components that are incorporated into our chassis and vehicles. For more information concerning our product warranties, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Form 10-K.
 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We have 24 United States patents (provisional and regular), which include rights to the design and structure of chassis and certain peripheral equipment, and have 13 pending patent applications in the United States. The existing patents will expire on various dates from 2018 through 2033 and all are subject to payment of required maintenance fees. We also own 31 United States trademark and service mark registrations. The trademark and service mark registrations are generally renewable under applicable laws, subject to payment of required fees and the filing of affidavits of use. In addition, we have various international trademark applications pending.
We believe our products are identified by our trademarks and that our trademarks are valuable assets to all of our business segments. We are not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of our trademarks that could materially affect our business. It is our policy to pursue registration of our primary marks whenever possible and to vigorously defend our patents, trademarks and other proprietary marks against infringement or other threats to the greatest extent practicable under applicable laws.
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 

Associates
 
We employed approximately 2,340 associates as of January 31, 2017, substantially all of which are full-time, including 119 contracted associates. Management presently considers its relations with associates to be positive.

Customer Base 
 In 2016, our customer base included one major customer as defined by sales of more than 10% of total net sales. Sales to Jayco, Inc. in 2016, which is a customer of our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment, were $71.0 million.
 
In 2015, our customer base included one major customer as defined by sales of more than 10% of total net sales. Sales to Jayco, Inc. in 2015, which is a customer of our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment, were $78.8 million.
 
In 2014, our customer base included one major customer as defined by sales of more than 10% of total net sales. Sales to Jayco, Inc. in 2014, which is a customer of our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment, were $57.1 million.
 
Sales to customers classified as major amounted to 12.0%, 14.3% and 11.3% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We do have other significant customers which, if the relationship changes significantly, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that we have developed strong relationships with our customers and continually work to develop new customers and markets. See related risk factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 
Sales to customers outside the United States were $31.7 million, $40.1 million and $55.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or 5.4%, 7.3% and 11.0%, respectively, of sales for those years. All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
 

Order Backlog
 Our order backlog by reportable segment is summarized in the following table (in thousands).
 

 | December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | 
-------------------------------+-------------------+---------+-------------------+--
Emergency Response Vehicles | $ | 139,870 | | $ | 156,270
Fleet Vehicles and Services | | 89,549 | | | 96,120 
Specialty Chassis and Vehicles | | 20,037 | | | 18,369 
Total consolidated | $ | 249,456 | | $ | 270,759

The decrease in our Emergency Response Vehicles backlog was driven by a reduction in order intake resulting from a more selective bid process established in 2016 as part of our turnaround strategy. The decrease in Fleet Vehicles and Services backlog was driven by a $25.5 million decrease in equipment up-fit orders, which was partially offset by an $18.9 million increase in vehicle orders. The increase in Specialty Chassis and Vehicles backlog was driven by an increase in orders for motor home chassis as a result of new model introductions and pricing adjustments enacted in 2016. 
 
Although the backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand, several factors, such as changes in production rates, available capacity, new product introductions and competitive pricing actions, may affect actual sales. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily indicative of eventual actual shipments.
