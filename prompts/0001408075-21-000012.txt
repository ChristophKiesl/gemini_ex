ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Graphic Packaging Holding Company (“GPHC” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is committed to providing consumer packaging that makes a world of difference. The Company is a leading provider of sustainable, paper-based packaging solutions for a wide variety of products to food, beverage, foodservice and other consumer products companies. The Company operates on a global basis, is one of the largest producers of folding cartons in the United States ("U.S.") and holds leading market positions in coated recycled paperboard ("CRB"), coated unbleached kraft paperboard (“CUK”) and solid bleached sulfate paperboard ("SBS").
The Company’s customers include many of the world’s most widely recognized companies and brands with prominent market positions in beverage, food, foodservice and other consumer products. The Company strives to provide its customers with innovative sustainable packaging solutions designed to deliver marketing and performance benefits at a competitive cost by capitalizing on its low-cost paperboard mills and converting facilities, its proprietary carton and packaging designs, and its commitment to quality and service.
On January 1, 2018, GPHC, a Delaware corporation, International Paper Company, a New York corporation (“IP”), Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formerly known as Gazelle Newco LLC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“GPIP”), and Graphic Packaging International, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formerly known as Graphic Packaging International, Inc. and a direct subsidiary of GPIP (“GPIL”), completed a series of transactions pursuant to an agreement dated October 23, 2017, among the foregoing parties (the “Transaction Agreement”). Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company transferred its ownership interest in GPIL to GPIP; (ii) IP transferred its North America Consumer Packaging (“NACP”) business to GPIP, which was then subsequently transferred to GPIL; (iii) GPIP issued membership interests to IP, and IP was admitted as a member of GPIP; and (iv) GPIL assumed certain indebtedness of IP (the "NACP Combination").
GPI Holding III, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“GPI Holding”), is the managing member of GPIP.
At the closing of the NACP Combination, GPIP issued 309,715,624 common units or 79.5% of the membership interests in GPIP to GPI Holding and 79,911,591 common units or 20.5% of the membership interests in GPIP to IP. Subject to certain restrictions, the common units held by IP are exchangeable into shares of common stock of GPHC or cash.
The following diagram illustrates the organization of the Company on January 1, 2018, immediately subsequent to the transactions described above (not including subsidiaries of GPIL):

On January 28, 2020, the Company announced that IP had notified the Company of its intent to begin the process of reducing its ownership interest in GPIP. Per the agreement between the parties, on January 29, 2020, GPIP purchased 15.1 million partnership units from IP for $250 million in cash. As a result, IP’s ownership interest in GPIP decreased to 18.3% as of January 29, 2020. 
On August 10, 2020, the Company announced that IP had notified the Company of its intent to exchange additional partnership units. Per the agreement between the parties, on August 13, 2020, GPIP purchased 17.4 million partnership units from IP for $250 million in cash, which included full redemption of the remaining 3.1 million partnership units that were required to be redeemed in cash. As a result, IP's ownership interest in GPIP decreased to 14.5% as of August 13, 2020.
Unless otherwise negotiated by the parties, IP’s next opportunity to exchange its partnership units begins 180 days from the August 13, 2020 purchase date and is limited to the lesser of $250 million or 25% of the units owned immediately following the initial transaction, subject to a minimum. IP will have further opportunities to exchange its partnership units beginning 180 days after each purchase date. The Company may choose to satisfy these exchanges using shares of its common stock, cash, or a combination thereof.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, GPIP repurchased 44.2 million partnership units from GPI Holding, which distributed the proceeds to GPHC. GPHC used the proceeds from these repurchases to repurchase 44.2 million shares of GPHC's common stock. These partnership unit repurchases increased IP's ownership interest in GPIP, which was 15.0% at December 31, 2020.

• Convenience through ease of carrying, storage, delivery, dispensing of product and food preparation for consumers;
• A smooth surface printed with high-resolution, multi-color graphic images that help improve brand awareness and visibility of products on store shelves; and
• Durability, stiffness and wet and dry tear strength; leak, abrasion and heat resistance; barrier protection from moisture, oxygen, oils and greases, as well as enhanced microwave heating performance.
The Company provides a wide range of sustainable paperboard packaging solutions for the following end-use markets:
• Beverage, including beer, soft drinks, energy drinks, teas, water and juices;
• Food, including cereal, desserts, frozen, refrigerated and microwavable foods and pet foods;
• Prepared food and drinks, including snacks, quick-serve food and drinks for restaurants and food service providers; 
• Household products, including dishwasher and laundry detergent, health care and beauty aids, and tissues and papers; and
• Air filter frames.
The Company’s packaging applications meet the needs of its customers for: 
Strength Packaging. The Company's products provide sturdiness to meet a variety of packaging, handling, and delivery needs, including tear and wet strength, puncture resistance, durability and compression strength (providing the ability to ship products in their own branded carton and stacking strength to meet store display packaging requirements).
Promotional Packaging. The Company offers a broad range of promotional packaging options that help differentiate its customers’ products in the marketplace. These promotional enhancements improve brand awareness and visibility on store shelves.
Convenience and Cooking Packaging. These packaging solutions improve package usage and food preparation:
• Beverage multiple-packaging — multi-packs for beer, soft drinks, energy drinks, teas, water and juices;
• Active microwave technologies — substrates that improve the heating and browning of foods in the microwave; and
• Easy opening and closing features — dispensing features, pour spouts and sealable liners.
Barrier Packaging. The Company provides packages that protect against moisture, temperature (hot and cold), grease, oil, oxygen, sunlight, insects and other potential product-damaging factors.
Paperboard Mills and Folding Carton Facilities
The Company produces paperboard at its mills; prints, cuts, folds, and glues (“converts”) the paperboard into folding cartons and containers at its converting plants; and designs and manufactures specialized, proprietary packaging machines that package bottles and cans and, to a lesser extent, non-beverage consumer products. The Company also installs its packaging machines at customer plants and provides support, service and advanced performance monitoring of the machines.
The Company offers a variety of laminated, coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from its CRB, CUK and SBS mills, as well as other grades of paperboard that are purchased from third-party suppliers.
Below is the production at each of the Company’s paperboard mills during 2020: 

Location | Product | # of Machines | 2020 Net Tons Produced
West Monroe, LA | CUK | 2 | 911,520 
Macon, GA | CUK | 2 | 712,326 
Texarkana, TX | SBS | 2 | 623,207 
Augusta, GA | SBS | 2 | 596,821 
Kalamazoo, MI | CRB | 2 | 511,852 
Battle Creek, MI | CRB | 2 | 215,610 
Middletown, OH | CRB | 1 | 175,266 
East Angus, Québec | CRB | 1 | 99,754 
White Pigeon, MI(a) | CRB | 1 | 34,098 
West Monroe, LA(a) | Corrugated Medium | 1 | 60,847 

(a) Indicates net tons produced from January to June. For more information, see Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
The Company consumes most of its coated board output in its converting operations, which is an integral part of the customer value proposition. In 2020, approximately 70% of combined mill sales of CRB, CUK and SBS was consumed internally.
CUK Production. The Company is the largest of four worldwide producers of CUK. CUK is manufactured from pine-based wood fiber and is a specialized high-quality grade of coated paperboard with excellent wet and dry tear strength characteristics and printability for high resolution graphics that make it particularly well-suited for a variety of packaging applications. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.
SBS Production. The Company is one of the largest North American producers of SBS. SBS is manufactured from bleached pine and hardwood-based wood fiber and is the highest quality paperboard substrate with excellent wet and dry strength characteristics and superior printability for high-end packaging. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics. SBS is also coated with polyethylene resin for wet strength liquid and food packaging end uses. 
CRB Production. The Company is the largest North American producer of CRB. CRB is manufactured entirely from recycled fibers, primarily old corrugated containers (“OCC”), doubled-lined kraft cuttings from corrugated box plants (“DLK”), old newspapers (“ONP”), and box cuttings. The recycled fibers are re-pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.
Corrugated Medium. The Company exited its corrugated medium production in June of 2020.
The Company converts CRB, CUK and SBS, as well as other grades of paperboard, into cartons and containers at converting plants the Company operates in various locations globally, including a converting plant associated with the Company's joint venture in Japan, contract converters and at licensees outside the U.S. The converting plants print, cut, fold and glue paperboard into cartons and containers designed to meet customer specifications.
Joint Venture
The Company, through its GPIL subsidiary, is a party to a Japanese joint venture, Rengo Riverwood Packaging, Ltd., in which it holds a 50% ownership interest. The joint venture agreement covers CUK supply, use of proprietary carton designs and marketing and distribution of packaging systems.
Sales and Marketing
The Company markets its products principally to multinational beverage, food, QSR, and other well-recognized consumer product companies. The beverage companies include Anheuser-Busch, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, among others. Consumer product customers include Kraft Heinz Company, General Mills, Inc., Nestlé USA, Inc., Kellogg Company, HAVI Global Solutions, LLC and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, among others. QSR customers include McDonald's, Wendy's, Panda Express, Dairy Queen, Chipotle, Panera and KFC, among others. The Company also sells paperboard in the open market to independent and integrated paperboard converters.
Sales of the Company’s principal products is primarily accomplished through sales offices in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser degree, through broker arrangements with third parties.
During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any one customer that represented 10% or more of its net sales.
Competition
Although a relatively small number of large competitors hold a significant portion of the paperboard packaging market, the Company’s business is subject to strong competition. The Company and WestRock Company ("WestRock") are the two major CUK producers in the U.S. Internationally, The Klabin Company in Brazil and Stora Enso in Sweden produce similar grades of paperboard.
In non-beverage consumer packaging and foodservice, the Company’s paperboard competes with WestRock's CUK, as well as CRB and SBS from numerous competitors, and, internationally, folding boxboard and white-lined chip. There are a large number of producers in the paperboard markets. Suppliers of paperboard compete primarily on the basis of price, strength and printability of their paperboard, quality and service.
In beverage packaging, cartons made from CUK compete with substitutes such as plastics and corrugated packaging for packaging glass or plastic bottles, cans and other primary containers. Although plastics and corrugated packaging may be priced lower than CUK, the Company believes that cartons made from CUK offer advantages over these materials in areas such as distribution, brand awareness, carton designs, package performance, package line speed, sustainability (particularly recyclability) and design flexibility.
Raw Materials
The paperboard packaging produced by the Company comes from pine and hardwood trees and recycled fibers. Pine pulpwood, hardwood pulp, paper and recycled fibers (including DLK, OCC and ONP) and energy used in the manufacture of paperboard, as well as poly sheeting, plastic resins and various chemicals used in the coating of paperboard, represent the largest components of the Company’s variable costs of paperboard production.
For the West Monroe, LA, Macon, GA, Texarkana, TX, and Augusta, GA mills, the Company relies on private landowners and the open market for all of its pine and hardwood pulp and recycled fiber requirements, supplemented by clippings that are obtained from its converting operations. The Company believes that adequate supplies from both private landowners and open market fiber sellers currently are available in close proximity to meet its fiber needs at these mills.
The paperboard grades produced at the Kalamazoo, MI, Battle Creek, MI, Middletown, OH, East Angus, Quebec and White Pigeon, MI mills are made from 100% recycled fiber. The Company procures its recycled fiber from external suppliers and internal converting operations. The market price of each of the various recycled fiber grades fluctuates with supply and demand. The Company’s internal recycled fiber procurement function enables the Company to pay lower prices for its recycled fiber needs given the Company’s highly fragmented supplier base. The Company believes there are adequate supplies of recycled fiber to serve its mills.
In North America, the Company also converts a variety of other paperboard grades, in addition to paperboard that is supplied to its converting operations from its own mills. The Company purchases such paperboard requirements, including additional CRB and SBS, from outside vendors. The majority of external paperboard purchases are acquired through long-term arrangements with other major industry suppliers. The Company's European converting plants consume CUK supplied from the Company's mills and also convert other paperboard grades such as white-lined chip and folding box board purchased from external suppliers.
Energy
Energy, including natural gas, fuel, oil and electricity, represents a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing and distribution costs. The Company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows and price risk related to future energy cost increases for a portion of its natural gas requirements at its U.S. mills. The Company’s hedging program for natural gas is discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Seasonality
The Company’s net sales, income from operations and cash flows from operations are subject to moderate seasonality, with demand usually increasing in the late spring through early fall due to increases in demand for beverage and food products. 
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development team works directly with its sales, marketing and consumer insights personnel to understand long-term consumer and retailer trends and create relevant new packaging. These innovative solutions provide customers with differentiated packaging to meet customer needs. The Company’s development efforts include, but are not limited to, developing sustainable packaging to replace plastic packaging, extending the shelf life of customers’ products; reducing production and waste costs; enhancing the heat-managing characteristics of food packaging; improving the sturdiness and compression strength of packaging to allow goods to ship in their own branded container and to meet store display needs; and refining packaging appearance through new printing techniques and materials.
Sustainability represents one of the strongest trends in the packaging industry and the Company focuses on developing more sustainable and eco-friendly products and manufacturing processes. The Company’s strategy is to combine sustainability with innovation to create new packaging solutions for its customers. 
For more information on research and development expenses see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse and inclusive working environment encourages creativity, innovation, and collaboration and that a diverse and inclusive culture propels our ability to serve our global customers and communities. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected in the definitions of our core values, which dictate behavioral norms. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors annually reviews the processes and practices related to workforce diversity and inclusion programs to ensure continued equitable treatment of all employees and a culture of inclusion. Our goal moving forward is to not only mirror the diversity of the communities where we operate, but also to excel in unlocking the potential that a diverse workforce can generate.
Community Engagement
Building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Our employees around the world dedicate their time and talents to improve the communities in which we live and work. Driven by our core values, making a difference for our customers, our consumers, and our community is at the root of our community engagement strategy. The Company focuses on three pillars that guide the strategy for our community service activities and philanthropic commitments: (1) putting food on the table, (2) preserving the environment, and (3) investing in education.
