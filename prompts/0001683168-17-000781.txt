PART II
 ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Business Development
 
Band Rep Management, Inc. (BRM, we, the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on May 4, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of May 31.
 
The Company intends to find and manage new music talents and bands for a 25% take of the earnings. As of the date of this 10K, we don’t have a functional website. We have secured our web domain (www.bandrepmanagement.com) and we have a website template that will be further developed upon available funds (see Plan of Operations).
 
BRM’s office is located at 112 North Curry Street, Carson City, Nevada, 89703, our telephone number is (775) 321-8207 and our fax number is (775) 546-6007. Our United States and registered statutory office is located at 112 North Curry Street, Carson City, Nevada, 89703, telephone number (775) 882-1013.
 
The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings since its incorporation nor has it been involved in any reclassification, merger or consolidation. We have no plans to change our business activities. 
 
In order to start generating revenue, our company needs to raise enough funds to successfully implement our Plan of Operations. Our president, Sergio Galli, has indicated that he will loan funds to the company to pay for costs to keep BRM’s status current with the SEC and other costs related to the offering for the next 12 months (up to $15,000) if necessary. There is no contract in place and this verbal commitment has no fixed repayment date and bears no interest.
 
 As of May 31, 2015, our president and director has loaned $31,952 to the Company. At the present time, we have generated no revenues from our business operations. We will need additional cash and if we are unable to raise it, we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash necessary to continue our business plan, or we cease operations entirely.
 
If we are unable to complete any phase of our business plan or marketing efforts because we don’t have enough money, we will cease our development and/or marketing activities until we raise money.
 
Attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our business plan would be difficult. As such, if we cannot secure additional funds we will have to cease operations and investors will lose their entire investment.
 
Plan of Operation
 
In order to have a successful Business, BRM needs to implement its initial plan of operations as described below. We plan to have all the business structure ready before searching for the talents so we can start developing their careers and generating revenue. The actions described below are intended to take place in the order presented herein and only after successfully accomplishing the prior step.
 
Step 1 – Research and interviews with attorneys: Our president will search for legal advice for the preparation of an initial services contract. It will be important to find a competent and reliable attorney and negotiate the best possible fee. Because we will possibly need legal advice in various moments (between us and our possible clients, record labels, music studios, etc.), a good relationship with a good attorney will be essential. The time frame estimated to accomplish these tasks will be 2 months and cost estimated at $12,000.
 
Step 2 – Research and Initial contact with music studios and labels: Our president will, after completing the first step described above, research and negotiate deals with music studios and labels. The objective is to form long lasting relationships with agents and promoters. The time frame estimated to accomplish these tasks will be 4 months and cost estimated at $10,000.

Step 3 – Website development: We plan to have our website fully developed only when we have successfully completed the steps described above. The Company’s president will oversee all the development of the website and will hire the necessary third party web developer, if necessary. The new artists would be able to upload their files for future BRM analysis and approval. At that point, we believe that we’ll be prepared to manage our business. The time frame estimated to accomplish these tasks will be 3 months and cost estimated at $5,000.
 
Step 4 –Marketing Campaign: Our goal is to create public awareness of our business. We intend to advertise on internet social media channel’s, such as Facebook and place advertisements in specialized magazines and websites. The time frame estimated to accomplish these tasks will be 3 months and cost estimated at $12,000.
 
In summary, we anticipate that we will be fully operational 12 months after we have raised enough funds to implement our Plan of Operations. We believe that we will begin to generate revenue after we are able to successfully develop the steps described above. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to continue operations, we will suspend or cease operations. We believe we will be able to successfully implement our plan of operations if we raise at least 25% of the securities offered for sale by the Company.
 
The Company will incur additional expenses by becoming a reporting issuer; the Company’s net proceeds would first be allocated to keep the Company current in its Security and Exchange commission obligations. The Company’s president has stated that he would lend the Company money to maintain its reporting status if required but there is no written contract between the Company and the president and there can be no assurance that the president will lend the Company funds if required.
