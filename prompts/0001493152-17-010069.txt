(b) Business of SPGX 
 
SPGX is a Nevada company and was incorporated on September 4, 2009. It is an exploration stage issuer engaged in the business of natural resource development and holdings through value based investments and collaborative partnerships with companies across the natural resources sector globally:
 
1. Thunder Bay Claims;
 2. Consulting services; and
 3. SP Group (Europe) AG.
 
1. Thunder Bay Claims – Ontario, Canada
 
SPGX is an exploration stage issuer and has no interest in any material property with mineral reserves. SPGX does have an interest in 13 mineral claims located in the Thunder Bay Mining Division Rickaby and Lapierre Townships in the Province of Ontario, Canada (the “Thunder Bay Claims”) which were acquired on March 13, 2007. All of the mineral claims are contiguous. Nine of the mineral claims are freehold patented mineral claims and the other four mineral claims are Crown Land claims. See Exhibit 10.2 - Property Purchase Agreement for more details.
 
SPGX has not determined whether the Thunder Bay Claims contain any mineral resources that are economically recoverable. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral resources exists on any of the Thunder Bay Claims. Exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility of the Thunder Bay Claims can be determined. It is possible that beyond the foreseeable future that if SPGX’s mineral exploration efforts fail and world-demand for the minerals SPGX is seeking drops to the point that it is no longer economical to explore for these minerals SPGX may need to change its business plan.
 
As of the date of this report, SPGX has not conducted any mineral exploration on the Thunder Bay Claims.
 
Location and Means of Access to the Thunder Bay Claims
 
The Thunder Bay Claims are located approximately 120 miles northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. The closest community to the Thunder Bay Claims with an established infrastructure is Geraldton, Ontario (pop. 3,000), which is located about 25 miles east of the Thunder Bay Claims. Geraldton has a population of about 3,000 permanent residents and offers most services required to support mining activities. The historic shaft found on the Thunder Bay Claims is located at approximately 49.82 degrees north latitude and 87.49 degrees west longitude.
 
Access to the Thunder Bay Claims is gained by motor vehicle from Highway 11 and its intersection with the King Horn Road. The King Horn Road is a major timber haul road and exploration access road located 4.3 miles east of the Village of Jellicoe. The Thunder Bay Claims are situated 13.8 miles along this road where it skirts the north shore of the Atigogama Lake. The shaft and the narrow open cut are located 650 feet north of the road.
 
Thunder Bay Claims
 
The Thunder Bay Claims are unencumbered and in good standing and there are no third party conditions that affect the Thunder Bay Claims other than conditions defined by the Province of Ontario described below. The combined Thunder Bay Claims together make up an area of 336 hectares, which is equivalent to approximately 810 acres. The following is a list of the 13 mineral claims:

Crown Land Claims (4 claims)
 
Rickaby Township
 
3011563
 4211215
 3011564
 
Lapierre Township
 
4279298
 
There is no assurance that any mineral resources exist on the Thunder Bay Claims. Exploration will be required before an evaluation as to the economic feasibility of the Thunder Bay Claims is determined. To the best of management’s knowledge there is no known production, past or current, on the four Crown Land Claims.
Conditions to Retain Title to the Thunder Bay Claims
 
The Thunder Bay Claims have been registered in the name of SPGX and currently all patented claims and Crown land claims are in good standing.
 
Freehold patented mineral claims typically confer all of the title to the subject lands and to all mines and minerals relating to such lands unless stated otherwise. To the extent that SPGX could determine, there are no surface dispositions impeding or hindering mineral exploration on the patented claims. Patented claims are exempt from assessment obligations, but are subject to annual mining land tax levied by the government of the Province of Ontario, which are approximately $1,300 per year for all nine patent claims.
 
The four Crown land claims have an expiry date of October 10, 2020 for the three claims in the Rickaby Township and July 15, 2018 for the one claim in the Lapierre Township, and in order to maintain the claims in good standing it will be necessary for SPGX to perform a minimum amount of work on the claims each year. Currently, over $300,000 has been registered on the three claims in the Rickaby Township for previous work assessments, and as a result, these claims will be in good standing until 2020. The one claim in the Lapierre Township will require a minimum of $6,000 of work assessment registered on that claim by July 15, 2018 in order to keep that claim in good standing. Failure to perform and record valid exploration work or pay the equivalent sum to the Province of Ontario on the anniversary dates will result in forfeiture of title to a particular Crown land claim.

Besides SPGX and the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, the Biinjitiwaabik Zaaging Anishinaabek First Nation may have authority of some nature in the Thunder Bay Claims. The Ontario ministries recognize the Aboriginal and treaty rights in the Ontario Mining Act, which in part affirms the duty of the claim stakeholder to consult with the First Nation before exploration and the commencement of an activity requiring exploration plans and permits. Even though the patented claims are exempt from the plan/permit requirements, stakeholders exploring on patented claims are urged to engage with First Nations in the consultative process to ensure continued free access.
 
History of the Thunder Bay Claims
 
The Thunder Bay Claims are located close to the Dik-Dik Mine, an historic gold mine established in 1934 after the discovery of gold in 1931 north of Lake Atigogama. The area surrounding the former mine was prospected while the mine was in operation, including the Thunder Bay Claims.
 
The property comprising the nine patented claims was first optioned to the Dikdik Exploration Co. Ltd. in 1933. These claims were registered under patented title in 1937 and mine operations were suspended. From 1940 to 1981 various individuals held the title to the claims, and the patents were lastly transferred to Canadian Gold Resources Inc. in 1981. In 1984, Kidd Resources Ltd. acquired these claims. In 1987 Canadian Gold Resource Ltd. conducted a 25-hole drill program on the claims. in 2006 Avenue Financial Corporation acquired these claims. In 2008 European Metals Corp. secured the surface rights to the claims, and conducted the last drill program on the claims. The claims finally reverted to John Leliever in 2014, and Mr. Leliever sold his interest in the claims to SPGX in 2017.
 
The four Crown Land Claims were originally staked in 1926. From 1926 to 1985 the claims were restaked numerous times and a variety of work was conducted on the claims with several days of work on the claims being records numerous times during that period. From 1985 to 1992 ground exploration was conducted on these claims on behalf of Freewest Resources Inc. In 1991, Consolidated Gold Hawk Resources Inc. and Hemlo Gold Mines Inc., in a joint venture, conducted line cutting and ground geophysical surveys, including IP resistivity. No material work has been undertaken on the four Crown Land Claims since 2008. At that time, 673 meters of trenching was completed, along with geophysics (IP resistivity) and 1, 483 meters of drilling.
 
It should be noted that these are historical details and SPGX has yet to confirm any mineral resources on the Thunder Bay Claims.
 
Condition of Thunder Bay Claims
 
SPGX has yet to access or explore the Thunder Bay Claims. The Thunder Bay Claims were last visited in the spring of 2008 by European Metals Corp. Since then no material work has been conducted on the Thunder Bay Claims. The Thunder Bay Claims are without known reserves and any program implemented by SPGX will be exploratory in nature.
Proposed Orphan and Foisey Exploration Programs.
 
Foisey Property
 
A proposed exploration program for the Foisey claims entails 2,000 meters of NQ diamond drilling is to test the north branching arm of an extensive gold bearing breccia system along a strike length of 600 meters. At an all-in cost of $300 / meter the program would cost $600,000.
Orphan Property
 
A proposed exploration program for the Orphan mine property entails 2,000 meters of NQ diamond drilling to test the down-dip and strike extension of gold mineralized zones identified from previous and historic work. At an all-in cost of $300/ meter the program would cost $600,000.
 
Total cost for the above programs is estimated to be $1,200,000 and require approximately 80 days for completion. Since the Foisey and Orphan mine properties form a contiguous claim fabric, the time frame for execution should be sequential allowing for cost effectiveness in terms of crew and equipment mobilization.

Infrastructure
 
There is no equipment, infrastructure or electricity on the Thunder Bay Claims. As a result, SPGX has no insurance covering the Thunder Bay Claims. Management believes that no insurance is necessary since the Thunder Bay Claims are unimproved and contain no buildings or improvements.
 
The property does host an underground sub-structure that includes an 80-meter shaft with levels at 45-meter and 75-meter depths. Approximately, 202 meters of drifts and cross cuts were developed to access and explore the Thunder Bay Claims.
 
Geology of the Thunder Bay Claims
 
The Thunder Bay Claims appear to possess geological characteristics of gold environments common with contemporary models of Archean lode gold greenstone belts. Some of these characteristics include (1) a regional scale deformation zone;
 (2) gold enriched quartz veins associated with penetrative foliation and shear zones; (3) the presence of mineralized high angle shear zones and faults proximal to a large pluton; (4) shear hosted veins in the volcanic sedimentary rocks, the contact zone of intrusive rocks with the volcanic-sedimentary succession, and the brittle fracture zones proximal to curvilinear/embayed contacts offering dilational zones for fluid and gold deposition within the intrusive phase; (5) poly-sulphide mineralization that includes pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalocpyrite, galena, and sphalerite; and (6) multi-environment gold mineral associations that include: gold in silicification alteration zones, quartz veins and veinlets, in metavolcanic-intrusive proximal zones, and within intrusive rocks.
 
In general, the Thunder Bay Claims have the potential to host minerals such as gold. However, it should be noted that SPGX has yet to confirm any mineral reserves on the Thunder Bay Claims, and the claims should be considered an early exploration stage project.
 
2. Consulting Services
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a consulting agreement dated April 24, 2017 between SP Group (Europe) AG and Sustainable Petroleum Group Inc., SPGX is providing advisory and consulting services to SP Group (Europe) AG for a three year term expiring on May 2, 2020. The services being provided include advising and conducting due diligence on international sustainable projects on behalf of SP Group (Europe) AG, with a focus on natural resource projects with reliable returns on investment. For providing these services, SP Group (Europe) AG pays a consulting fee of $5,000 per month to SPGX. In the second year of the term, SPGX will receive $10,000 per month and in the third year will receive $15,000 per month. See Exhibit 10.6 - Consulting Agreement for more details.
 
3. SP Group (Europe) AG
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a share purchase agreement dated July 6, 2017 between Sustainable Petroleum Group Inc. and Christopher Grunder, SPGX purchased 2,000 shares in the capital of SP Group (Europe) AG. These shares represent a 20% interest in SP Group (Europe) AG. As consideration for the purchased shares, SPGX issued 6,000 restricted shares of common stock in the capital of SPGX to the seller for a purchase price of $21,000. See Exhibit 10.4 - Share Purchase Agreement for more details.
 
In addition, as a condition precedent to the Share Purchase Agreement, SPGX required SP Group (Europe) AG and its majority shareholder to enter into an agreement that will require SP Group (Europe) AG to declare an annual dividend to be paid to all of its shareholders. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the dividend agreement dated July 10, 2017 among Christopher Grunder, Sustainable Petroleum Group Inc, and SP Group (Europe) AG, SPGX will be entitled to 20% of the net profits of SP Group (Europe) AG in each fiscal year. See Exhibit 10.5 - Dividend Agreement for more details.
 
Competition
 
SPGX competes with other exploration stage issuers for the acquisition of new mineral exploration properties and for equipment and labor related to the exploration and development of such properties, and for the financing to fund such acquisitions and exploration work. Many of the exploration stage issuers that SPGX competes with have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, and on the exploration and development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford to retain geologists with more geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral exploration properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact SPGX’s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for SPGX to develop its mineral exploration properties.Additionally, management believes SPGX is an insignificant participant among the firms that engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than SPGX. In view of SPGX’s limited financial resources and limited management availability, SPGC will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors.

Raw Materials
 
SPGX currently has no business operations that require raw materials, and does not produce any products or provide any services that require any raw materials nor any suppliers.
Dependence on Major Customers
 
SPGX has one major client, SP Group (Europe) AG, which SPGX is currently providing consulting services to in accordance with the Consulting Agreement. See Exhibit 10.6 - Consulting Agreement for more details. SPGX is dependent on this one client as the loss of SP Group (Europe) AG as a client would have a material adverse effect on this segment of SPGX’s business operations.
 
Patents/Trade Marks/Licences/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labour Contracts
 
SPGX has no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks.
 
Additionally, SPGX has no royalty agreements or labor contracts, with the exception of the 3.0% net smelter return that had been granted to John Leliever by Workplan Holding Inc., and which was carried forward as a condition of the acquisition of the Thunder Bay Claims. SPGX may at its discretion buy back half of the 3% NSR (1.5%) for a one-time payment of CDN$1,500,000.00 prior to a bankable prefeasibility being completed on any of the Thunder Bay Claims. See Exhibit 10.2 - Property Purchase Agreement for more details.
 
Government Controls and Regulations 
 
SPGX’s various business segments are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. Currently, SPGX is in compliance with all business and operations licenses that are typically applicable to most commercial ventures. However, management is unable to predict what additional legislation or revisions may be proposed that might affect its business or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective. There can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the future, will not impose additional fees and taxes on SPGX and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on SPGX’s business and add additional costs to SPGX’s business operations. Such changes, however, could require increased capital and operating expenditures and could prevent or delay certain operations by SPGX.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. With respect to the regulation of mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclamation and rehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time.
 
For the Thunder Bay Claims, the Ontario Mining Act requires exploration/mining proponents to submit exploration plans and permits to the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines, but only as those regulations pertain to Crown land claims, as the regulations do not apply to patented claims.
 
The effect of these existing regulations on the business segments is that SPGX is able to carry out its current business operations as planned. However, it is possible that future governments could change the regulations that could affect the business operations and limit SPGX’s ability to continue its business operations.

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
SPGX currently has no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning its exploration program on the Thunder Bay Claims, and there are no known environmental restrictions affecting exploration on the Thunder Bay Claims. Also, there are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.
Expenditures on Research and Development During the Last Two Fiscal Years
 
Since September 4, 2009, SPGX has not spent any funds on either company-sponsored research and development activities or customer-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the improvement of existing products, services, or techniques.
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
SPGX currently does not have any employees. In each segment of its plan of operations, SPGX intends to retain the services of key management to assist in the various aspects of its business operations, such as exploration programs on the Thunder Bay Claims, consulting services, and ongoing business development.
