Overview
California Water Service Group is a holding company incorporated in Delaware in 1999 with six operating subsidiaries: California Water Service Company (Cal Water), New Mexico Water Service Company (New Mexico Water), Washington Water Service Company (Washington Water), Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. (Hawaii Water), and CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC (CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services LLC being referred to collectively in this annual report as Utility Services). Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities. The regulated 
4

utility entities also provide some non-regulated services. Utility Services provides non-regulated services to private companies and municipalities. Cal Water was the original operating company and began operations in 1926.
Our business is conducted through our operating subsidiaries and we provide utility services to approximately two million people. The bulk of the business consists of the production, purchase, storage, treatment, testing, distribution and sale of water for domestic, industrial, public and irrigation uses, and for fire protection. We also provide non-regulated water-related services under agreements with municipalities and other private companies. The non-regulated services include full water system operation, billing and meter reading services. Non-regulated operations also include the lease of communication antenna sites, lab services and promotion of other non-regulated services.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no significant changes in the kind of products produced or services rendered by our operating subsidiaries, or in the markets or methods of distribution.

Regulated Business
California water operations are conducted by the Cal Water and CWS Utility Services entities, which provide service to approximately 482,400 customer connections in approximately 100 California communities through 25 separate districts. Of these 25 districts, 23 districts are regulated water systems, which are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Cal Water operates two leased water systems, the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, which are governed through their respective city councils and are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. California water operations accounted for approximately 94% of our total customer connections and approximately 93% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
Hawaii Water provides service to approximately 4,400 water and wastewater customer connections on the islands of Maui and Hawaii, including several large resorts and condominium complexes. Hawaii Water's regulated customer connections are subject to the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. Hawaii Water accounts for approximately 1% of our total customer connections and approximately 4% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
Washington Water provides domestic water service to approximately 16,700 customer connections in the Tacoma and Olympia areas. Washington Water's utility operations are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. Washington Water accounts for approximately 3% of our total customer connections and approximately 2% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
New Mexico Water provides service to approximately 8,000 water and wastewater customer connections in the Belen, Los Lunas and Elephant Butte areas in New Mexico. New Mexico's regulated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. New Mexico Water accounts for approximately 2% of our total customer connections and approximately 1% of our total consolidated operating revenue.
The state regulatory bodies governing our regulated operations are referred to as the Commissions in this annual report. Rates and operations for regulated customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the respective state's regulatory Commission. The Commissions require that water and wastewater rates for each regulated district be independently determined based on the cost of service, except in Washington, which has a statewide tariff. The Commissions are expected to authorize rates sufficient to recover normal operating expenses and allow the utility to earn a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.
We distribute water in accordance with accepted water utility methods. Where applicable, we hold franchises and permits in the cities and communities where we operate. The franchises and permits allow us to operate and maintain facilities in public streets and right-of-ways as necessary.
We operate the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce water systems under lease agreements. In accordance with the lease agreements, we receive all revenues from operating the systems and are responsible for paying the operating costs. The City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce lease revenues are governed through their respective city councils and are considered 
5

non-regulated because they are outside of the CPUC's jurisdiction. We report revenue and expenses for the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce leases in operating revenue and operating expenses because we are entitled to retain all customer billings and are responsible for all operating expenses. These leases are considered "nontariffed products and services (NTPS)" by the CPUC and require a 10% revenue sharing with regulated customers.
In October 2011, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Hawthorne to lease and operate its water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne's population. The capital lease agreement required an up-front $8.1 million lease deposit to the city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments will be adjusted based on changes in rates charged to customers. Under the lease we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. Capital improvements are recorded as depreciable plant and equipment and depreciated per the asset lives set forth in the agreement. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $8.5 million, $8.0 million and $7.8 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease. The City of Hawthorne capital lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2026.
In July 2003, an agreement was negotiated with the City of Commerce to lease and operate its water system. The operating lease requires us to pay $0.8 million per year in monthly installments and $200 per acre-foot for water usage exceeding 2,000 acre-feet per year, plus a percentage of certain operational savings that may be realized. Under the lease agreement, we are responsible for all aspects of the system's operations. The city is responsible for capital expenditures, and title to the system and system improvements resides with the city. We bear the risks of operation and collection of amounts billed to customers. The agreement allows Cal Water to request a rate change in order to recover costs. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $2.5 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The City of Commerce lease is a 15-year lease and expires in 2018.
Non-Regulated Activities
Fees for non-regulated activities are based on contracts negotiated between the parties. Under our non-regulated contract arrangements, we operate municipally owned water systems, privately owned water and recycled water distribution systems, but are not responsible for all operating costs. Non-regulated revenue received from water system operations is generally determined on a fee-per-customer basis. 
Non-regulated revenue and expenses consist primarily of the operation of water systems that are owned by other entities under lease agreements, leasing of communication antenna sites on our properties, billing of optional third-party insurance programs to our residential customers, and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan insurance investments.
Effective June 30, 2011, the CPUC adopted new rules related to the provision of non-regulated services using utility assets and employees. As a result, nearly all California non-regulated activities are now considered NTPS. The prescribed accounting for these NTPS is incremental cost allocation plus revenue sharing with regulated customers. Non-regulated services determined to be "active activities" require a 10% revenue sharing, and "passive activities" require a 30% revenue sharing. The amount of non-regulated revenues subject to revenue sharing is the total billed revenues less any authorized pass-through costs. Some examples of CPUC authorized pass-through costs are purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes. All of our non-regulated services, except for leasing communication antenna sites on our properties and unrealized gains or losses on benefit plan insurance investments, are "active activities" subject to a 10% revenue sharing. Leasing communication antenna sites on our properties are "passive activities" subject to a 30% revenue sharing. Cal Water's annual revenue sharing with regulated customers was $2.1 million, $2.2 million, and $2.3 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
Operating Segment
We operate in one reportable segment, the supply and distribution of water and providing water-related utility services. For information about revenue from external customers, net income and total assets, see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Growth
We intend to continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities in the western United States. The opportunities could include system acquisitions, lease arrangements similar to the City of Hawthorne and City of Commerce contracts, full service system operation and maintenance agreements, meter reading, billing contracts and other utility-related services.

Rates and Regulation
The Commissions have plenary powers setting both rates and operating standards. As such, the Commissions' decisions significantly impact the Company's revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts, unless otherwise stated, and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a 12-month period from the effective date of the decision. In California, water utilities are required to make several different types of filings. Certain filings, such as: General Rate Case (GRC) filings, escalation rate increase filings, and offset filings, may result in rate changes that generally remain in place until the next GRC. As explained below, surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as GRC interim rate relief are temporary rate changes, which have specific time frames for recovery.
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) follows a rate case plan, which requires Cal Water to file a GRC for each of its regulated operating districts every three years. In a GRC proceeding, the CPUC not only considers the utility's rate setting requests, but may also consider other issues that affect the utility's rates and operations. The CPUC is generally required to issue its GRC decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates. In accordance with the rate case plan, the CPUC issued a decision on Cal Water's 2015 GRC filing in the fourth quarter of 2016 with rates effective on January 1, 2017.
Between GRC filings, Cal Water may file escalation rate increases, which allow Cal Water to recover cost increases, primarily from inflation and incremental investments, during the second and third years of the rate case cycle. However, escalation rate increases are district specific and subject to an earnings test. The CPUC may reduce a district’s escalation rate increase if, in the most recent 13-month period, the earnings test reflects earnings in excess of what was authorized for that district.
In addition, California water utilities are entitled to make offset requests via advice letter. Offsets may be requested to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in GRCs when those capital projects go into service (these filings are referred to as "rate base offsets"), or for rate changes charged to Cal Water for purchased water, purchased power, and pump taxes (which are referred to as "expense offsets"). Rate changes approved in offset requests remain in effect until the next GRC is approved.
In pursuit of the CPUC's water conservation goals, the CPUC decoupled Cal Water's revenue requirement from customer consumption levels in 2008 by authorizing a Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (WRAM) and Modified Cost Balancing Account (MCBA) for each district. The WRAM and MCBA ensure that Cal Water recovers revenues authorized by the CPUC regardless of customer consumption. This removes the historical disincentive against promoting lower water usage among customers. Through an annual advice letter filing, Cal Water recovers any under-collected metered revenue amounts authorized, or refunds over-collected quantity revenues, via surcharges and surcredits. The advice letters are filed between February and April of each year and address the net WRAM and MCBA balances recorded for the previous calendar year. The majority of WRAM and MCBA balances are collected or refunded through surcharges/surcredits over 12 and 18 months. The WRAM and 
8

MCBA amounts are cumulative, so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year, the balance is carried forward and included with the following year balance.
Regulatory Activity - California
2015 GRC filing
On December 15, 2016, the CPUC voted to approve Cal Water's 2015 GRC settlement agreement. The approved decision, which was proposed by the presiding Administrative Law Judge in November 2016, authorizes Cal Water to increase gross revenue by approximately $45.0 million starting on January 1, 2017, up to $17.2 million in 2018, up to $16.3 million in 2019, and up to $30.0 million upon completion and approval of the Company’s advice letter projects. The 2018 and 2019 revenue increases are subject to the CPUC’s earning test protocol.
The CPUC’s decision also authorizes Cal Water to invest $658.8 million in water system improvements throughout California over the three-year period of 2016-2018 in order to continue to provide safe and reliable water to its customers. This figure includes $197.3 million of water system infrastructure improvements that will be subject to the CPUC’s advice letter procedure.
Expense offset requests
Expense offsets are dollar-for-dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses, and therefore do not affect net operating income. In December of 2015, Cal Water submitted advice letters to offset increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in 6 of its regulated districts, totaling $4.8 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2016.
In June of 2016, Cal Water submitted advice letters to offset increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in seven of its regulated districts, totaling $13.9 million. The new rates became effective in the third quarter of 2016.
In October of 2016, Cal Water submitted advice letters to request offsets for increases in purchased water costs and pump taxes in four of its regulated districts totaling $1.9 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2017.
Escalation increase requests
As a part of the decision on the 2012 GRC, Cal Water was authorized to request annual escalation rate increases for 2015 and 2016 for those districts that passed the earnings test. In December of 2015, Cal Water requested escalation rate increases in 17 districts. The annual adopted gross revenue associated with the December 2015 filing was $5.0 million. The new rates became effective on January 1, 2016.
Rate base offset requests
For construction projects authorized in GRCs as advice letter projects, Cal Water is allowed to request rate base offsets to increase revenues after the project goes into service. In June of 2016, Cal Water filed $0.2 million of annual revenue increase for a rate base offset in one of its regulated districts. The new rates became effective on August 1, 2016.
In November of 2016, Cal Water submitted rate base offset requests totaling $2.6 million. Rates reflecting these increases became effective on January 1, 2017.
WRAM/MCBA filings
In April of 2016, Cal Water filed three advice letters to true up the revenue over- and under-collections in the 2015 annual WRAMs/MCBAs of its regulated districts. A net under-collection of $20.4 million is being recovered from customers in the form of 12 and 18 month surcharges/surcredits.  This surcharge/surcredit is in some cases in addition to surcharges/surcredits authorized in prior years that have not yet expired.
Drought Memorandum Account
The incremental costs tracked in the drought memorandum account for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2016 were $5.0 million, of which $0.7 million was spent on capital. For the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2015, incremental costs were $5.2 million, of which $0.9 million was spent on capital.
On July 15, 2016, Cal Water submitted an advice letter to recover $4.2 million of incremental drought expenses associated with calendar years 2014 and 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, Cal Water discussed the request with interested parties, including the ORA. A revised advice letter was submitted on October 12, 2016 by Cal Water to recover $2.9 million in incremental costs related to 2014 and 2015 expenses. On December 15, 2016, the CPUC approved a resolution to allow Cal Water to begin recovering the requested $2.9 million through a surcharge, which became effective January 1, 2017. 
9

 In 2017, Cal Water expects to submit an advice letter to request recovery for the incremental drought expenses from 2016 and the incremental capital expenditures from 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Cal Water submitted an advice letter on July 15, 2016 to request the elimination of the drought surcharges beginning on July 29, 2016. All monies collected by Cal Water through drought surcharges for exceeding water budgets are recorded in the appropriate WRAM account and used to offset under-collected revenues. Customer drought surcharges were $62.8 million and waste-of-water penalties were less than $0.1 million for the period from July 1, 2015 to July 29, 2016. For the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2016, customer drought surcharges were $25.9 million and waste-of-water penalties were less than $0.1 million. For the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2015, customer drought surcharges were $36.9 million and waste-of-water penalties were less than $0.1 million.
Federal Income Tax Bonus Depreciation
In 2011, Cal Water filed for and received approval to track the benefits from federal income tax accelerated depreciation in a memorandum account due to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Additional federal income tax accelerated depreciation deductions for assets placed in service were $8.9 million, $14.4 million, and $34.0 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The memorandum account resulted in a surcredit because of the impact to Cal Water’s revenue requirement for changes to working cash estimates, reductions to federal income tax-qualified U.S. production activities deductions (QPAD), and changes to contributions-in-aid-of-construction (CIAC). The December 15, 2016 GRC decision adopted a settlement, which, beginning in 2017, will credit customers $0.7 million and close the memorandum account.
Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Memorandum Account
California established a binding Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) in 2000. Due to Cal Water’s large number of wells and extensive use of groundwater, the Company was severely impacted by MTBE contamination, spurring the Company to take immediate action to comply with the MCL and maintain its water supply capacity. Cal Water constructed a surface water treatment plant, installed treatment on groundwater wells, abandoned impacted wells, and constructed new wells. Cal Water’s timely response enabled them to fully comply with MTBE regulations, but at significant costs. The costs prompted Cal Water to take legal action against responsible parties. Cal Water requested and was granted a memorandum account in Advice Letter 1701 (filed February 2, 2005) to track MTBE Litigation costs and proceeds recovered through MTBE Litigation. Since 2005, Cal Water received settlement proceeds and applied the majority of the proceeds to remediation projects.
In the CPUC’s December 15, 2016 decision authorizing the GRC settlement, Cal Water was given conditions on how to allocate the remaining balance in the account. Once all conditions have been met, the MTBE memorandum account is to be closed. Of the remaining unallocated balance, customers will receive $0.5 million as CIAC and Cal Water was authorized to retain $1.5 million as non-regulated revenue in 2016.
East Los Angeles Memorandum Account (ELA MA)
The ELA MA was authorized in the 2012 Settlement Agreement adopted in D.14-08-011. In Cal Water’s 2012 GRC, Cal Water and ORA disagreed on the appropriateness of Cal Water’s property purchase in its East Los Angeles District at 2000 Tubeway Avenue (the “Tubeway Property”) in the amount of $6.8 million to construct two new groundwater wells and to move its customer and operations centers to the Tubeway Property. As part of the 2012 GRC Settlement, the Parties agreed that 50% of the Tubeway Property purchase could be included in rate base to account for the total land cost for the wells at this site. The remaining 50% (in the amount of $3.4 million, to account for the warehouse building), and the full amount of the Phase 1 building improvements ($1.2 million), could be tracked in the ELA MA, along with the related carrying costs (consisting of the return on investment, ad valorem taxes, and depreciation). In the CPUC’s December 15, 2016 decision authorizing the GRC settlement, Cal Water was authorized to recover the carrying costs for 2014, 2015, and 2016 in the amount of $1.6 million as operating revenue in 2016.
 2016 Regulatory Activity - Other States
2016 Pukalani (Hawaii) GRC Filing
In December of 2016, Hawaii water filed a GRC for its Pukalani wastewater system requesting an additional $1.3 million in revenues on an annual basis. This revenue increase will be implemented over 5 years. The application requested recovery for increases in operating expenses since the previous rate case. Additionally, the application requested recovery of the balance of the cost of the wastewater treatment plant that was not approved to be included in customer rates in the previous rate case. The first phase of the revenue increase is expected to become effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. Discovery between the parties has begun.
10

2015 Ka'anapali (Hawaii) GRC Filing
In December of 2015, Hawaii Water filed a GRC for its Ka’anapali water system requesting an additional $1.7 million in revenues on an annual basis. The application requested recovery for approximately $3.0 million in capital investments in the system since 2012. During the second quarter of 2016, we achieved a full settlement with all interveners in the amount of $1.1 million. On September 12, 2016, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC) authorized the rate increase. New rates became effective on October 18, 2016. 
2014 Kona (Hawaii) GRC Filing
In August of 2014, Hawaii Water filed a GRC for Kona water and wastewater requesting $3.3 million.  On June 29, 2015, Hawaii Water received a Decision and Order from the HPUC for the Kona water and wastewater rate case approving $2.1 million in additional annual revenues to be implemented over a six month period. Hawaii Water reached a comprehensive and conceptual settlement with the Consumer Advocate, which is an independent agency that reviews Hawaii Water's rate case applications. The new rates for the first phase were effective in August 2015 and the new rates for the second phase took effect in February of 2016.
2012 Waikoloa (Hawaii) GRC Filings
In August of 2012, Hawaii Water filed GRCs for the Waikoloa Village Water, Waikoloa Village Wastewater, and Waikoloa Resort Utilities requesting $6.3 million in additional annual revenues. The GRCs were processed on separate schedules. Hawaii Water and the Consumer Advocate reached settlements on the rate filings for Waikoloa Village Water, Waikoloa Village Wastewater, and Waikoloa Resort Utilities. On June 22, 2015, the HPUC approved a rate increase for the Waikoloa Village Wastewater rate case authorizing annual revenue increase of $0.7 million implemented over two years. The new rates for the first phase were effective in August 2015 and the second phase became effective in August of 2016. 
2011 Pukalani (Hawaii) GRC Filing
In August of 2011, Hawaii Water filed a GRC for Pukalani wastewater system. On January 15, 2014, Hawaii Water received a Decision and Order for the GRC for the Pukalani wastewater system rate case approving $0.6 million in additional annual revenues. Hawaii Water reached a comprehensive and conceptual settlement with the Consumer Advocate. This decision approved an increase of $0.3 million in 2014, another increase of $0.2 million in 2015, and another increase of $0.2 million in 2016. Each increase is separated by one year. The new rates for 2016 took effect in February of 2016.
Water Supply
Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. To the best of management's knowledge, we are meeting water quality, environmental, and other regulatory standards for all Company-owned systems.
Historically, approximately 49% of our annual water supply is pumped from wells. State groundwater management agencies operate differently in each state. Some of our wells extract ground water from water basins under state ordinances. These are adjudicated groundwater basins, in which a court has settled the dispute between landowners or other parties over how much annual groundwater can be extracted by each party. All of our adjudicated groundwater basins are located in the State of California. Our annual groundwater extraction from adjudicated groundwater basins approximates 6.8 billion gallons or 15% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Historically, we have extracted less than 100% of our annual adjudicated groundwater rights and have the right to carry forward up to 20% of the unused amount to the next annual period. All of our remaining wells extract ground water from managed or unmanaged water basins. There are no set limits for the ground water extracted from these water basins; however, the state or local water management agencies have the authority to regulate the groundwater extraction quantity whenever there are unforeseen large decreases to water basin levels. Our annual groundwater extraction from managed groundwater basins approximates 28.1 billion gallons or 59% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Our annual groundwater extraction from unmanaged groundwater basins approximates 12.2 billion gallons or 26% of our total annual water supply pumped from wells. Most of the managed groundwater basins we extract water from have groundwater recharge facilities. We are required to pay well pump taxes to financially support these groundwater recharge facilities. Our well pump taxes for the 12 months ending December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $11.3 million, $11.5 million, and $12.9 million, respectively. In 2014, the State of California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014. The law and its implementing regulations will require most basins to select a sustainability agency by 2017, develop a sustainability plan by 2022, and show progress toward sustainability by 2027. We expect that in the future, groundwater will be produced mainly from managed and adjudicated basins.

California's normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid-spring and mid-fall. The Washington Water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons, with the heaviest amounts during the winter. New Mexico Water's rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season. Hawaii Water receives precipitation throughout the year, with the largest amounts in the winter months. Water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months. Rain and snow during the winter months in California replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs, providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers. As of January 31, 2017, the State of California snowpack water content during the 2016-2017 water year is 148% of long-term averages (per the California Department of Water Resources, Northern Sierra Precipitation Accumulation report). The northern Sierra region is the most important for the state’s urban water supplies. The central and southern portions of the Sierras also have recorded 177% and 207%, respectively, of long-term averages. Management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during 2017 and beyond. Long-term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions. Some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards, but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes.
The following table shows the estimated quantity of water purchased and the percentage of purchased water to total water production in each California operating district that purchased water in 2016. Other than noted below, all other districts receive 100% of their water supply from wells.

The Bear Gulch district obtains a portion of its water supply from surface runoff from the local watershed. The Oroville district in the Sacramento Valley, the Bakersfield district in the San Joaquin Valley, and the Kern River Valley district in the Los Angeles Area purchase water from a surface supply. Surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system. The Bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply.
12

The Chico, Marysville, Dixon, and Willows districts in the Sacramento Valley, the Salinas and King City districts in the Salinas Valley, and the Selma and Visalia districts in the San Joaquin Valley obtain their entire supply from wells.
Purchases for the Los Altos, Livermore, Oroville, Redwood Valley, Stockton, and Bakersfield districts are pursuant to long-term contracts expiring on various dates after 2016. The water supplies purchased for the Dominguez, East Los Angeles, Hermosa Redondo, Palos Verdes, and Westlake districts as well as the Hawthorne and Commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non-preferential service to purveyors within the agencies' boundaries. Purchases for the Bayshore and Bear Gulch districts are in accordance with long-term contracts with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) until June 30, 2034.
Management anticipates water supply contracts will be renewed as they expire though the price of wholesale water purchases is subject to pricing changes imposed by the various wholesalers.
Shown below are wholesaler price rates and increases that became effective in 2016 and estimated wholesaler price rates and percent changes for 2017. In 2016, several districts experienced significant purchased water cost increases, resulting in a significant impact in the 2016 MCBA balance and the filing of several purchased water offsets.

Seasonal Fluctuations
In California, our customers' consumption pattern of water varies with the weather, in terms of rainfall and temperature. In the WRAM and MCBA design, the CPUC considers the historical pattern in determining the adopted sales and production costs. With a majority of our sales being subject to the WRAM and production costs being covered by the MCBA, fluctuations in financial results have been minimized. However, cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings on our credit facilities can be significantly impacted by seasonal fluctuations including recovery of the WRAM and MCBA.
Our water business is seasonal in nature. Weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage. Customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy winter months. Demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end, and customer use more water for outdoor purposes, such as landscape irrigation. Warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand. Water usage declines during the fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins. During years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer, customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels, generally due to reduced outdoor water usage. Likewise, an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage. As a result, seasonality of water usage has a significant impact on our cash flows from operations and borrowing on our short-term facilities.
Utility Plant Construction
We have continually extended, enlarged, and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems. We obtain construction financing using funds from operations, short-term bank borrowings, long-term financing, advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers. Advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers. These advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of 40 years in equal annual payment amounts. Contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers, primarily for fire protection and relocation projects. We cannot control the amounts received from developers. This amount fluctuates from year-to-year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies. This activity is impacted by the demand for housing, commercial development, and general business conditions, including interest rates.
See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional information.
Energy Reliability
We continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers, and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies' supplies are interrupted. Many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages. Storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods.
Impact of Climate Change Legislation
Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings.
We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that were retrofitted to meet California emission standards. If future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. These regulations have not impacted water utilities at this time. In the future, if we are required to comply with these regulations, any increase in operating costs associated with meeting these standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our customers 
14

as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.
Security at Company Facilities
Due to terrorism and other risks, we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems' security.
Quality of Water Supply
Our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices. Water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards. Most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection. Water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular, scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. We operate a state-certified water quality laboratory at the San Jose General Office that provides testing for most of our California operations. Certain tests in California are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program. Local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii operations.
In recent years, federal and state water quality regulations have resulted in increased water sampling requirements. The SDWA continues to be amended to address public health concerns. We monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations.
Competition and Condemnation
Our principal operations are regulated by the Commission of each state. Under state laws, no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable Commission. Issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient. To management's knowledge, no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made.
State law provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss. State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities. The agencies are also authorized to issue bonds, including revenue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems. However, if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action, the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss. In Washington, annexation was approved in February 2008 for property served by us on Orcas Island; however, we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to impact our operations. To management's knowledge, other than the Orcas Island property, no municipality, water district, or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities. Environmental health and safety programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations, underground and aboveground fuel storage tank regulations, hazardous materials management plans, hazardous waste regulations, air quality permitting requirements, wastewater discharge limitations and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials. Also, we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environmental regulations.
For a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment." We expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future, and there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had 1,163 employees, including 53 at Washington Water, 45 at Hawaii Water, and 16 at New Mexico Water. In California, most non-supervisory employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.
At December 31, 2016, we had 741 union employees. In January 2015, we negotiated a six-year contract that included 2015, 2016, and 2017 wage increases with both of our unions of 3.25% and 2.75%, and 2.75%, respectively. Annual wage increases for 2018, 2019, and 2020 are estimated to be in the range from 2.5% to 3.25% based on current forecast inflation rates. The wage changes will fluctuate with the changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the Los Angeles area. In the event an annual wage increase is determined to be greater than 3.25% or less that 2.0%, either party may request to re-open negotiations for wages only. Such notice must be served on the other party no later than 60 days after the publication of such CPI data. The current agreement with the unions is effective through 2020. Management believes that it maintains good relationships with the unions.
Employees at Washington Water, New Mexico Water, and Hawaii Water are not represented by unions.
