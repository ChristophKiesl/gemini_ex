Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 Genpact stands for “generating business impact.” We are a global leader in digitally-powered business process management and services. We architect the Lean DigitalSM enterprise through our patented Smart Enterprise Processes (SEPSM) framework that reimagines our clients’ operating models end-to-end, including the middle and back offices. This creates Intelligent OperationsSM that we help design, transform, and run. The impact on our clients is a high return on transformation investments through growth, efficiency, and business agility. For two decades, first as a division of the General Electric Company, or GE, and later as an independent company, we have been passionately serving our clients. Today, we generate impact for a few hundred strategic clients, including approximately one fifth of the Fortune Global 500, and have grown to over 75,000 people in 25 countries, with corporate offices in New York City. The resulting business process and industry domain expertise and experience running complex operations are a unique heritage and focus that help us drive the best choices across technology, analytics, and organizational design. 
 Our business was initially conducted through various entities and divisions of GE. We began operating as an independent company in 2004, when GE spun off our operations and sold indirect interests in us to our initial investors. In 2007, we completed our initial public offering. In 2012, affiliates of Bain Capital Investors, LLC, or Bain Capital, acquired the majority of the remaining interests held by our initial investors. As of December 31, 2016, Bain Capital (through its affiliates) owned approximately 29% of our outstanding equity. 
 In 2016, we had net revenues of $2.57 billion, of which $2.21 billion, or 86%, was from clients other than GE, which we refer to as Global Clients, with the remaining $358 million, or 14%, coming from GE. 
 We provide digitally-driven solutions that draw on our deep domain expertise, our understanding of process operations, analytics and advanced technology, and the operational insight we have acquired from our experience in managing thousands of processes for our clients. We seek to build long-term client relationships with companies that wish to improve the ways in which they do business and to whom we can offer a full range of services. Our business is increasingly focused on digital and consulting solutions, and we made significant investments in these areas in 2016.
 
Genpact Digital 
 Genpact’s digital practice helps architect the Lean DigitalSM enterprise, enabling clients to re-imagine their business operations by extending the power of digital all the way through the middle and back offices in an effort to enhance growth, cost efficiency, and business agility. Building on our foundation of deep process expertise in industry and functional domains and our SEPSM framework, our digital approach harnesses advanced technologies to drive transformative solutions for our clients through the application of actionable analytics that can be incorporated into their operations. Through this approach, we strive to improve our clients’ returns on existing IT investments.
 In 2016, we opened the Genpact Lean DigitalSM Innovation Center, a lab designed to help our clients drive digital transformations across their enterprises. The Innovation Center enables clients to learn about new digital solutions and how they apply to their specific business needs through a comprehensive program that includes three key components: customer-focused design thinking workshops to help identify and reframe problems and develop innovative ideas that can scale to accelerate business impact; a digital incubation program that leverages carefully selected cutting-edge digital technology disruptors with proven success in developing real-life solutions that add value to the client experience; and a co-innovation lab that brings enterprise executives together with technology and business process experts to turn ideas into actionable prototypes through rapid development. 
 
Smart Enterprise Processes (SEPSM) 
 SEPSM is our patented and highly granular approach to dramatically improving the performance of business processes. In addition to efficiency, it focuses on maximizing process effectiveness. 
 SEPSM and its more recent evolution, Digital SEPSM, are based on work done in the Genpact Process Innovation Lab, where we leverage our exposure to thousands of business processes and hundreds of millions of client transactions to map and analyze end-to-end processes at a granular level. This enables us to test the effectiveness of 
 1


clients’ processes by identifying opportunities for improvement using best-in-class and granular benchmarks gleaned from within and across industries and then applying our deep process knowledge, process-centric technology, and analytical skills to improve them. The result is a client-specific road map for maximizing process effectiveness.
 Digital SEPSM builds on our SEPSM framework, developing our digital and domain-specific assets and solutions in an effort to drive business impact for clients in such areas as profitability and cash flows, user and customer experience, speed and strategic risk.  Using Lean and design-thinking principles, we have built proprietary digital assets to address the domain-specific needs of clients in our targeted industry verticals. Our Digital SEPSM solutions leverage our digital expertise in mobility, cloud, workflow, advanced visualization, robotics, and machine learning capabilities and incorporate proprietary frameworks that we use to determine a client’s process, technology and performance maturity. 
 
Our Strategic Client Model 
 We seek to create long-term relationships with our clients where they view us as an integral part of their organization and not just as a service provider. These relationships often begin with the outsourcing of discrete processes or with shorter-cycle engagements in analytics and research or consulting and transformation services. Over time, these relationships often expand to encompass multiple business processes across a broader set of functions and geographic areas.
 No matter how large or small the engagement, we strive to be a seamless extension of our client’s operations. To achieve this goal, we developed the Genpact Virtual CaptiveSM model for service delivery, and we may implement all or some of its features in any given client relationship, depending on the client’s needs. This approach provides clients with dedicated employees and management as well as dedicated infrastructure at our delivery centers to create virtual extensions of the client’s own teams and environments. We train our personnel in the client’s culture to be familiar not only with the process but also with the business environment in which it is being executed. 
Our Strategy 
 The specific elements of our strategy include the following: 
 Enhance Targeted Vertical Industry and Domain Expertise 
 Clients want partners who know their industry and processes at a granular level. We continue to seek to enhance our industry and domain capabilities through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and by investing in experienced professionals in our targeted verticals and service areas to strengthen client relationships and help us deliver end-to-end services that drive business impact. 
 Guide Global Enterprises to Best-in-Class 
 Our Smart Enterprise Processes (SEPSM) framework, built on the foundation of thousands of Lean Six Sigma-based improvement ideas and benchmarks around granular process performance, builds deeper client relationships and delivers measurable business impact over time. We continue to integrate new digital technologies and data analytics into these frameworks to develop Digital SEPs. Our differentiated framework is critical not only to extending client contracts but also to creating an expansive partnership with our clients. 
Differentiate our Solutions by Combining Process Expertise, Analytics and Technology 
 Clients face an environment of uncertainty and change, which requires them to better leverage existing costs and investments, and make more informed decisions that address challenges around regulations and risk, while they continue to drive top-line growth and profitability. The insights we derive from our experience and expertise, combining smarter processes, analytics and technology, help us provide a differentiated solution to these challenges.

Expand Geographically in Key Markets 
 We deliver our services and solutions from service delivery centers in 17 countries, including nine locations in the United States. We continue to expand and diversify our delivery capabilities globally in order to be closer to our clients. 
Our Services 
 We seek to deliver significant business impact for our clients by designing, transforming and running a combination of processes, as well as providing solutions that combine elements of several of our service offerings. We recognize that our clients are focused on achieving business outcomes, rather than on transferring particular processes or using particular platforms. Accordingly, we focus on understanding their business needs and the business context of their existing processes in order to design appropriate and comprehensive solutions. We help organizations examine and re-frame the challenges that prevent them from reaching their business objectives by using design-thinking practices to help them reimagine end-to-end processes and rapidly leveraging the power of effective digital solutions, including reusable tools, platforms, and analytics.

 Our professional services offerings in these core industry verticals are driven by our broad end-to-end process expertise in a number of service areas, including analytics and research, collections and customer services, consulting and transformation services, core industry operations services, enterprise application services, finance and accounting (F&A) services, IT infrastructure management services, and supply chain and procurement services.
 Analytics and Research 
 Our analytics and research capabilities are central to our ability to improve business operations and drive transformational value for clients. We offer analytics services in areas where we have domain expertise, both on a standalone basis and as an integrated part of our other service offerings. We help our clients reimagine their business operations in the context of analytics and technology through the delivery of Genpact Intelligent OperationsSM fueled by our Lean DigitalSM approach. Using Systems of EngagementTM, we have built what we refer to as the Genpact Intelligent Process Insights Engine, a process-aware platform that embeds technology and analytics to deliver purpose-built analytics applications. 
 Through our Data-to-ActionSM Analytics approach, we deliver measurable business outcomes to clients across industries. Companies do not always recognize the inherent potential in data or have the capability to apply rigorous analytical models that can reveal opportunities. Our domain-specific analytics prowess, along with a sophisticated innovation ecosystem, is embedded in our service offerings to help clients make timely, informed and fact-based decisions. By quantitatively and qualitatively scrutinizing data, we can deliver the insight necessary for clients to assess new business opportunities, mitigate market risks, and make better business decisions. Our innovation centers in Bangalore, India, and Palo Alto, California facilitate collaboration and innovation with clients, partners and industry experts by bringing together process-centric digital technologies, design thinking, data and analytics, and deep domain expertise. 
 Collections and Customer Services 
 Our collections and customer services are provided primarily in the areas of consumer banking, business-to-business finance and mortgage servicing. Our collections services include collections strategy design through smart analytics and a full range of accounts receivable management services, such as early to late stage collections, skip-
 4


tracing, refunds and other specialized services. In our collections services, we act as an agent only; we do not acquire debts for our own account or handle debtor payments. Our customer services include account servicing and customer care services such as handling customer queries, general servicing and dispute resolution. We support omnichannel interactions and provide origination and order management support. 
 Consulting and Transformation Services
 Our consulting teams apply Lean DigitalSM practices to help clients design the right strategy and target operating model for their functions. We help clients develop transformation roadmaps that deliver all components of a target operating model vision and implement process-driven improvements. Our business and enterprise risk consulting teams support our clients through transformation delivery, including enhanced internal controls and regulatory compliance. We partner with our clients to reimagine their controllership functions and improve their risk and control environments across operational and regulatory processes while preserving value and mitigating risk exposure. 
 Our transformation services leverage digital, analytics and consulting solutions to help clients create competitive advantage and realize cost savings or increase revenues by improving or re-engineering business processes that are underperforming or by designing new processes to meet growth objectives. Clients engage our transformation teams to provide an end-to-end view of their organization and help determine business-process needs at the strategic and execution levels. Strategically, we help clients achieve a comprehensive assessment of how well their enterprise-level processes – such as source to pay, order to cash, record to report, inquiry to order, new product introduction and salesforce effectiveness – perform against industry benchmarks and best practices. At the execution level, we institutionalize the recommendations by deploying resources to train the client team and drive sustainable best practices. 
 Our consulting and transformation services build on our deep understanding of the complete enterprise operating model and draw on our expertise in process, state-of-the-art technology, organizational structures, compliance and risk-mitigation strategies. We combine a design-thinking approach with our industry and domain expertise to create client offerings that apply cutting-edge digital technologies and analytics with the goal of driving fundamental shifts in clients’ business performance.
 Core Industry Operations Services 
 We help our clients design, transform and run core enterprise operations specific to their industries. On the foundation of domain expertise embedded in our SEPSM frameworks, we use Lean DigitalSM to leverage digital technologies and specialized analytics to power Intelligent OperationsSM. We support our clients’ core operations in retail and commercial banking, capital markets, insurance, healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, consumer goods and retail, and high tech.  
 Enterprise Application Services 
 Our information technology approach focuses on business outcomes and related business processes. Equipped with industry and functional expertise and guided by our proprietary Lean DigitalSM approach, we aim to create Intelligent OperationsSM that execute efficiently and effectively, and continuously learn to adapt. Our focused approach is designed to maximize the impact that business processes have on business outcomes while limiting capital expenditures, risk, complexity, and time-to-benefit. Our solutions include business intelligence and big data, enterprise resource planning, quality assurance and technology integration. We also have significant expertise in Hyperion, SAS and Cognos, and platform support for ERP systems such as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. 
 Finance and Accounting (F&A) 
 We believe we are one of the world’s premier providers of F&A services. Our services include Accounts Payable (AP), Order to Cash (OTC), Record to Report (R2R), Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), and Enterprise Risk and Compliance (ERC) services. Our AP services span the end-to-end AP function and include document management, invoice processing, approval and resolution management, and T&E processing. Our OTC services cover customer master data management, credit and contract management, fulfillment, billing, collections, and dispute management services. Our R2R services encompass accounting, closing and reporting, including SEC

and regulatory reporting, treasury, tax services, and product cost accounting. Our EPM services include budgeting, forecasting, business performance reporting and analytics, including predictive analytics. Our ERC services specialize in operational risk and controls, Sarbanes-Oxley Act advisory, third-party risk management and regulatory compliance with services such as enterprise risk management, internal audits, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and IT risk management. 
 In addition to managing our clients’ finance and accounting processes, we help them design, transform, and run their finance operating models to achieve best-in-class performance. As part of our Lean DigitalSM approach, Genpact Systems of EngagementTM for F&A creates an agile technology layer that complements existing systems of record, providing continuity of information and operations across the enterprise. Our Systems of EngagementTM modules for OTC, AP, R2R, and EPM support smart processes, detailed analytics, and a host of agile technologies, including proprietary cloud-based technology platforms and bolt-on, best-of-breed solutions from our technology partners. Our F&A services also include Digital SEPSM frameworks and solutions, which aim to reimagine client processes.  
 IT Infrastructure Management Services 
 Our IT infrastructure management services consist of end user computing, infrastructure management services, application production support and database management services. We provide support in more than 25 languages with a global footprint of native speakers. We provide monitoring and management of clients’ data centers, servers, storage, emails, networks, databases, applications and end user devices. We use a network of Remote Operations Centers to provide 24/7 infrastructure monitoring and management. Along with Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) ISO 20000, we use Six Sigma and Lean principles to address technology problems and to enable our clients to align their IT capabilities with their business priorities and at the same time reduce technology costs. We use our proprietary SEPSM framework Service Disruption to Restore (D2R), along with our accelerators and IP frameworks, to continuously reduce defects. We also provide cloud infrastructure services, IT service integration and management and cyber security services apart from ITIL implementation services.  
Supply Chain and Procurement 
 Our supply chain and procurement services include direct and indirect strategic sourcing, category management, spend analytics, procurement operations, master data management, and other procurement and supply chain advisory services. We work with our clients to design, transform and run sourcing strategies across expense categories, drive process compliance and realize significant cost reduction in their businesses. This includes sourcing and procurement process transformation, inventory planning and optimization, value transformation and process automation. Using our Lean DigitalSM approach, we integrate disparate technology systems and provide dynamic digital dashboard reporting while transforming business operations and improving service productivity. We leverage our technology expertise in delivering our services in this area, particularly in automating order management processes and optimizing the supply chain. We have competency in many of the custom platforms used by our clients and are not tied to any single platform or vendor.  
Our Clients 
 Our clients include some of the best known companies in the world, many of which are leaders in their respective industries. 
 GE has been our largest client since our inception and accounted for approximately 14% of our 2016 revenues. We currently provide services to most of GE’s business units, including GE Capital, Power and Water, Oil and Gas, Energy Management, Renewables, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation, Current, Digital and Corporate. The services we currently provide to GE are broad in their nature and are drawn from all of our service offerings. Although we have a single master services agreement, or MSA, with GE, we have many statements of work, or SOWs, with GE business units that cover in more detail the nature of the work we will perform and the amounts we will bill for the relevant services. As a general matter, each GE business unit makes its own decisions as to whether to enter into a SOW with us and as to the terms of any such SOW. Therefore, although some decisions may be made centrally at GE, our revenues from GE are generally attributable to a number of different businesses each with its own leader responsible for decision-making regarding our services. 
 6


We have over 700 clients spread across a variety of industries and geographies. Our net revenues from clients other than GE, or Global Clients, have grown rapidly in the last five years, from $1.12 billion in 2011 to $2.21 billion in 2016, a compound annual growth rate of 14.7%. Our net revenues from Global Clients as a percentage of total net revenues increased from approximately 70% in 2011 to approximately 86% in 2016. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Classification of Certain Net Revenues.” The majority of our Global Clients are based in the United States, and we also have Global Clients in Europe, Asia and Australia. 
 Our contracts with our clients generally take the form of an MSA, which is a framework agreement that is then supplemented by SOWs. Our MSAs specify the general terms applicable to the services we will provide. For a description of our MSAs and SOWs, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Revenues.” 
 We serve about one fifth of the Global Fortune 500, including AstraZeneca, Boeing, Citigroup, GE, GlaxoSmithKline, Heineken, Honeywell, Kraft-Heinz, Merck, Nissan, Walgreens and Wells Fargo.
 Our People 
 Our people are critical to the success of our business. Our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our senior leadership team have been involved in our business since its commencement under GE resulting in an experienced and cohesive leadership team. Many members of our leadership team developed their management skills working within GE and many of them were involved in the founding of our business. They have built our business based on the experience gained in helping GE meet a wide range of challenges. As a result, we are an institutional embodiment of much of the wisdom and experience GE developed in improving and managing its own business processes. 
 We have created, and constantly reinforce, a culture that emphasizes teamwork, constant improvement of our processes and, most importantly, dedication to the client. We manage this challenge through innovative human resource practices. These include broadening the employee pool by opening delivery centers in diverse locations, using innovative recruiting techniques to attract the best employees, emphasizing ongoing training, instilling a vibrant and distinctive culture and providing well-defined, long-term career paths. We also have programs modeled on GE management training programs to develop the next generation of leaders and managers of our business. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 75,000 employees. We monitor and manage our attrition rate very closely, and believe it is one of the lowest in the industry. We attribute this to our reputation, our ability to attract high quality applicants, our emphasis on maintaining our culture and the breadth of exposure, experience and opportunity for advancement that we provide to our employees. 
 Lean and Six Sigma Methodologies 
 Lean is a methodology for reducing waste or inefficiency in a process. Among other things, it is designed to measure and eliminate overproduction, over-processing and waiting, and to improve the flow of a process. Six Sigma is a method for improving process quality by removing variation, defects and their causes from business activities. We have Lean Six Sigma programs that train, test and grade employees in Lean and Six Sigma principles and award them Lean Six Sigma certifications. In 2015, we launched a simplified transformation framework – ProDGSM, a four-step method focused on driving outcomes leveraging Lean Six Sigma, transformation, change management, digital and design-thinking tools. The rankings of Lean Six Sigma qualifications from lowest to highest are green belt, black belt and master black belt. With the growing prevalence of digital technologies incorporated in our solutions, we also certify digital black belts and digital master black belts.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 17,000 employees with Six Sigma green belt training, over 500 employees with Six Sigma black belt training, and more than 46,000 Lean-trained employees. This large number of employees with Lean Six Sigma training helps infuse our organization with a disciplined, analytical approach to everything we do. 
 Recruiting 
 We face meaningful competition for skilled employees in every jurisdiction in which we operate. We have refined our talent acquisition strategy by organizing our recruiting teams by industry vertical and utilizing an 
 7


internal executive recruiting team, social media platforms, online job portals and professional search firms to recruit globally. Our internal employee referral program has also become a key recruiting vehicle for us. We believe that our focus on our employees’ career development makes us attractive to candidates beyond our delivery center locations. As part of our global diversity and inclusion efforts, we have implemented Career 2.0, a program to attract top female leaders who have just returned from the workforce after an extended break. 
 Training and Development 
 We believe in extensive and continuous training of our employees. We have the infrastructure to train approximately 6,000 people at any one time with approximately 250 trainers. In 2016, we had more than 16,500 employees enrolled in part-time professional degree, e-learning and other non-degree programs provided internally or by universities and other third parties. Our training programs are designed to transfer the industry-specific knowledge and experience of our industry leaders to our employees to ensure we maintain our deep process and domain expertise across the industries and processes in which we work. Our training programs cover a large number of topics, including specific service offerings, key technical and IT skills, our different clients’ workplace cultures and Lean and digital transformation methodologies. A large part of our continuous training is designed to impart the skills and knowledge required by our employees to move to positions of increasing responsibility within Genpact. 
Retention 
 In order to meet our growth and service commitments, we are constantly striving to attract and retain employees. There is significant turnover of employees in the business process management and information technology sectors generally, particularly in India where the majority of our employees are currently based. Our attrition rate for all employees who have been employed by us for one day or more was 26% in 2016. We believe this rate is relatively low for our industry based on statistics published by industry associations such as NASSCOM. We attribute this low attrition rate to a number of factors, including our effective recruiting measures, extensive training and a strong culture of providing opportunities for growth and learning. 
 We also take aggressive action to monitor and minimize potential attrition. Using Six Sigma principles we have developed an early warning system that tracks employees and gives us an insight into which employees are most likely to resign. These employees are automatically highlighted to management who can take action such as relocating the employee or enrolling the employee in continuing education programs to increase the likelihood of retention. 
 As another measure designed to minimize attrition, we “right-skill” our employees to the tasks assigned to them. This means that we match the level of services required to the experience and qualification of the employee concerned and we avoid having over-qualified people in any particular job. This allows us to give our highly qualified and experienced people higher-value jobs and, coupled with the practice of up-skilling, ensures better career paths for all of our employees. 
 Corporate Social Responsibility 
 Our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative aims to integrate our social and environmental priorities with our operational fabric.  Genpact’s approach to CSR focuses on three pillars that reflect our strengths and core expertise and include causes that our employees are passionate about: 

• | Education and employability
--+----------------------------


• | Environment and sustainability
--+-------------------------------


• | Diversity and inclusion
--+------------------------

 
We have institutionalized a culture of giving and volunteering through a number of global platforms, programs, projects and social initiatives. Our more than 15,000 employee volunteers have, among other things, helped underprivileged children and women to develop vocational skills, worked on environmental initiatives such as rejuvenating urban forest land and participating in cleaning drives, and participated in programs that address the health and nutritional needs of the poor. Additionally, more than 15,000 of our employees have participated in our payroll-based charitable donation programs.

Our Alliances 
 We have entered into and continue to pursue partnerships or alliances with companies whose capabilities complement ours in an effort to enhance our existing solutions or create new solutions to address market needs. Such alliances may be transaction- or deal-specific, may be for the development of joint capabilities in a service line or may take the form of enterprise-wide transformational partnerships.  Our alliances generally fall into one of four categories: joint ventures; strategic, go-to-market alliances; deal-specific partnerships to provide a joint solution to a client; or digital and other “white label” partnerships.
 Our digital partnerships aim to nurture relationships with established and emerging players and start-ups that specialize in leading-edge disruptive digital technologies that we can embed into our solutions. Our Lean DigitalSM Innovation Center in Palo Alto supports these partnerships, combining our partners’ solutions with our expertise and hands-on practical experience. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We market our services to both existing and potential clients through our business development team and our global relationship managers. Members of this team are based around the globe, including in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, and dedicate their time to expanding the services we provide to our existing clients as well as acquiring new clients. 
 We have designated client partners and global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry/product subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client, using measures such as the Net Promoter Score. Our sales force is primarily organized by industry vertical teams that are supported by horizontal service offerings. 
 The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. The sales cycle for project work is much shorter than the sales cycle for a large business process engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. In addition to our business development personnel, the sales effort involves people from the relevant service areas, people familiar with that prospective client’s industry, business leaders and Six Sigma resources. We may expend substantial time and resources in securing new business. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Revenues.” 
 As our relationship with a client grows, the time required to win an engagement for additional services often gradually declines. In addition, as we become more knowledgeable about a client’s business and processes, our ability to identify opportunities to create value for the client typically increases. For example, productivity benefits and greater business impact can often be achieved by applying our Lean DigitalSM approach and SEPSM methodology, by focusing on processes that are “upstream” or “downstream” from the processes we initially handle, or by applying our analytical, consulting and digital capabilities to transform processes.
 
We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. Our governance methodology is designed to ensure that we are well connected at all levels of our clients’ organizations (executive, management and operations). 
 Significant new business opportunities are reviewed by business and sales leaders from the applicable industry vertical, operations personnel, and members of our finance department. If they determine that the new business is aligned with our strategic objectives and a good use of our resources, then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity. 
 Global Delivery Platform 
 A key differentiator is our global network of 75 delivery centers in 17 countries. We also have a number of employees who work directly in client locations or provide services from a virtual environment which offers

flexibility for both clients and employees. Our presence in locations around the world provides us with multilingual capabilities, access to a larger talent pool, “near-shoring” capabilities to take advantage of time zones, as well as the ability to provide services from the United States. With this network, we manage complex processes in multiple geographic regions. We use different locations for different types of services depending on the specific client needs and the mix of skills and cost of employees available in each location. We choose the location of our delivery centers based on a number of factors, which include the available talent pool, infrastructure, government support and operating costs, as well as client demand. 
 We have been a pioneer in our industry in opening centers in several cities in India as well as in some of the other countries in which we operate. We were one of the first companies in our industry to establish operating centers in certain locations, including Dalian, Foshan and Huaqiao in China; Bucharest in Romania; and Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Kolkata in India. We regularly evaluate new locations, including new countries and new cities within countries in which we currently operate, as potential sites for delivery centers and offices. Our delivery centers are located in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Guatemala, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we provided services in more than 30 languages. 
 The large number of different countries from which we serve our clients differentiates us from a number of our competitors and enables us to take advantage of different languages and time zones which, in turn, enhances our ability to serve our clients. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Increasingly, the solutions we offer our clients include a range of proprietary methodologies, software, and reusable knowledge capital. We also develop intellectual property in the course of our business and our agreements with our clients regulate the ownership of such intellectual property. We regularly apply for patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and domain names to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property rights are trade secrets and relate to proprietary business process enhancements. 
 At times, we use third-party software platforms and the software systems of our clients to provide our services. Our agreements with our clients normally include a license to use the client’s proprietary systems to provide our services. Clients authorize us to access and use third party software licenses held by the client so that we may provide our services. 
 
It is our practice to enter into agreements with our employees and independent contractors that: 
  
• | ensure that all new intellectual property developed by our employees or independent contractors in the course of their employment or engagement is assigned to us;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide for employees’ and independent contractors’ cooperation in intellectual property protection matters even if they no longer work for us; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | include a confidentiality undertaking by our employees and independent contractors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market. We have a number of competitors offering services that are the same as or similar to ours. Our competitors include: 

• | large multinational service providers and accounting firms that provide consulting and other professional services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies that are primarily business process service providers operating from low-cost countries, most commonly India;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies that are primarily information technology service providers with some business process service capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | smaller, niche service providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including digital; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


 
• | in-house departments of companies that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 
  
• | skills and capabilities;
--+-------------------------


• | technical and industry expertise;
--+----------------------------------


• | innovative service and product offerings, including digital offerings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to add value, including through continuous process improvement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation and client references;
--+----------------------------------


• | contractual terms, including competitive pricing;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | scope of services;
--+-------------------


• | quality of services and solutions;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ability to sustain long-term client relationships; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | global reach and scale.
--+------------------------

 Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 
 

Regulation 
 We are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions around the world as a result of the complexity of our operations and services, including at the federal, state and local level, particularly in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services. We are also subject to regulation by regional bodies such as the European Union, or EU. 
 In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some of our service contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us, and sometimes our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for our clients to comply with requirements that are applicable to them. In some of our other service contracts, our clients undertake the responsibility to inform us about laws and regulations that may apply to us in jurisdictions in which they are located. 
 If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may be restricted in our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our clients generally have the right to terminate our contracts for cause in the event of regulatory failures, subject to notice periods. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business.” If we fail to comply with contractual commitments to facilitate our clients’ compliance, we may be liable for contractual damages, and clients in regulated industries may be less willing to use our services. In addition, public figures in the United States, including the current U.S. President and members of his administration, have suggested that changes to certain regulations applicable to us may potentially be adopted. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Future legislation or executive action in the United States and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability or willingness of our clients and prospective clients to utilize our services.”
 In the United States, we are either directly subject to, or contractually required to comply or facilitate our clients’ compliance with, laws and regulations arising out of our work for clients operating there, especially in the area of banking, financial services and insurance, such as the Financial Modernization Act (sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Home Owners Loan Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and regulation by U.S. agencies such as the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit 
 11


Union Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We are also subject to regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the Communications Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and applicable regulations in the area of health and other personal information that we process as part of our services. 
 Because of our debt collections work in the United States, we are also regulated by laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and related regulations. We are currently licensed to engage in debt collection activities in all jurisdictions in the United States where licensing is required. 
 Because of our mortgage origination activities in the United States, in addition to the applicable regulations listed above, we are subject to laws such as the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We currently hold mortgage-related licenses, registrations or letters of exemption from licensing in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and are regulated by each applicable state regulatory agency. 
 Because of our insurance processing activities, we are currently licensed as a third-party administrator in 41 states and are regulated by the department of insurance in each such state. In two other states, we qualify for regulatory exemption from licensing based on the insurance processing activities we provide. 
 
We are affected by laws in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU that are intended to limit the impact of outsourcing on employees in those countries. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Future legislation or executive action in the United States and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability or willingness of our clients and prospective clients to utilize our services.” 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations on direct marketing, such as the Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, and the CAN-SPAM Act. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing foreign trade, such as export control, customs and sanctions regulations maintained by government bodies such as the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and Homeland Security Department’s Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. 
 Several of our service delivery centers, primarily located in India, China, the Philippines and Guatemala, benefit from tax incentives or concessional rates provided by local laws and regulations. The Indian Special Economic Zones Act of 2005, or SEZ legislation, introduced a tax holiday in certain situations for operations established in designated “special economic zones,” or SEZs. The SEZ tax benefits are available only for new business operations that are conducted at qualifying SEZ locations. We cannot predict what percentage of our operations or income in India or other jurisdictions in future years will be eligible for a tax holiday. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Income Taxes.” In addition to the tax holidays described above, certain benefits are also available to us under certain Indian state laws. These benefits include rebates and waivers in relation to payments for the transfer or registration of property (including for the purchase or lease of premises), waivers of conversion fees for land, exemption from state pollution control requirements, entry tax exemptions, labor law exemptions and commercial usage of electricity. 
 Our hedging activities and currency transfer are restricted by regulations in certain countries, including India, Romania and China. 
 Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 
 As a Bermuda company, we are also subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 regulating the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions from contributed surplus. 
 12


We are classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Pursuant to our non-resident status, we may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars. There are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents that are holders of our common shares. 
 Under Bermuda law, “exempted” companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license granted by the Minister of Economic Development, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.
