ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are a medical technology company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of next-generation, less invasive medical devices to advance gastrointestinal therapeutic endoscopy.
Our Endoscopy product portfolio consists of the OverStitch® Endoscopic Suturing System, X-Tack® Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System, Apollo ESG™, Apollo ESG Sx™, Apollo REVISE™, Apollo REVISE Sx™ Systems and Orbera® Intragastric Balloon.
Our products are primarily used by gastroenterologists and bariatric surgeons in a variety of settings to treat multiple gastrointestinal (“GI”) conditions including closure of acute perforations and chronic fistulas; tissue closure after the removal of abnormal neoplastic lesions in the esophagus, stomach or colon (also known as polypectomy, endoscopic submucosal dissections, endoscopic mucosal resections and endoscopic full thickness resections); the treatment of swallowing disorders (peroral endoscopic myotomy, or “POEM”); esophageal stent fixation and obesity.
Beginning in 2021, we have revitalized our organization with the addition of key members to our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of U.S. Sales, Vice President of Marketing and Medical Education, and Vice President of Market Access and Reimbursement. By leveraging our team’s extensive experience to create clinically distinct solutions that improve patient lives, we have created a strong foundation for growth and believe that we are well-positioned to positively impact patient care and address substantial unmet clinical needs in gastroenterology and bariatrics. We intend to become a technology provider of choice for doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems, and payors.
Proposed Acquisition by Boston Scientific Corporation
On November 29, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Boston Scientific Corporation (“Boston Scientific”) and Textile Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific (“Merger Sub”), providing for the acquisition of Apollo by Boston Scientific. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Boston Scientific will acquire Apollo via the merger of Merger Sub with and into Apollo, with the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub thereupon ceasing and Apollo continuing as the surviving company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific (the “Merger”). The Merger was approved by our stockholders on February 9, 2023. The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as well as other customary closing conditions. If the Merger is consummated, each of our stockholders will be entitled to receive $10.00 in cash, without interest thereon, for each share of our common stock that the stockholder owns immediately prior to the time at which Merger has become effective, unless the stockholder is entitled to and has properly exercised and not waived, withdrawn, failed to perfect or otherwise lost the stockholder’s appraisal rights. 
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for Apollo and Boston Scientific. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, under certain specified circumstances, Boston Scientific will be obligated to pay to the Company a termination fee equal to (i) $30.0 million in cash if, prior to such termination, Boston Scientific has not exercised its right to extend the date by which the Merger must become effective pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “Outside Date”) from January 31, 2024 to July 31, 2024, or (ii) $50.0 million in cash if, prior to such termination, Boston Scientific has exercised its right to extend the Outside Date from January 31, 2024 to July 31, 2024. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under other certain specified circumstances, Apollo will be obligated to pay to Boston Scientific a termination fee equal to $19.0 million in cash.
See the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Proposed Transaction with Boston Scientific” included under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the risks associated with the Merger.
Recent Developments
In July 2022, we announced the marketing authorization of the Apollo ESG™, Apollo ESG Sx™, Apollo REVISE™ and Apollo REVISE Sx™ Systems through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) De Novo Classification process, a rigorous pre-market pathway for low-to moderate-risk devices without a predicate. These products are the first and only devices authorized by the FDA for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and endoscopic bariatric revision. In the third quarter of 2022, we began education, marketing and training programs to increase awareness, use and adoption of our suturing technologies in weight loss procedures in the U.S. We have initiated a limited launch and completed our first commercial sale in the first quarter of 2023.
Also in July 2022 the landmark Multi-center ESG Randomized Interventional Trial (MERIT) was published in The Lancet. The MERIT study is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) procedure, a minimally invasive, endoscopic weight loss procedure performed with Apollo Endosurgery’s OverStitch® Endoscopic Suturing System. In the study, patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥30 and ≥40 kg/m² were randomized to treatment with ESG and lifestyle modification or to a control group which involved lifestyle modification alone. At the conclusion of the primary endpoint (52 weeks), qualifying patients in the control group were allowed to cross-over to ESG if they met certain conditions. Nine U.S. centers participated in the study, representing both gastroenterology and bariatric surgery practices from academic and community settings. One hundred and fifty-seven subjects completed the study through 52 weeks of follow up (68 treatment and 89 control subjects). Seventy-two control patients crossed over to treatment at 52 weeks, and both groups were followed an additional 52 weeks. Key results for patients undergoing ESG include:
•49.2% excess body weight loss at 12 months in the treatment group (vs 3.2% EWL in control); 
•16.3% average total body weight loss in the responder group; 
•68.3% of responders maintained at least 25% EWL at 104 weeks; 
•improvements in quality of life, eating behaviors, and depression; and
•three ESG patients (2.0%) experienced a device or procedure related serious adverse event, all of which resolved and did not require intensive care or surgical intervention. 
Corporate Background
Apollo was founded in 2005 and is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Company was founded to develop and commercialize innovations originating from a collaboration of physicians from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Medical University of South Carolina, the University of Texas Medical Branch and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who called themselves the Apollo Group. The work of the Apollo Group resulted in a significant portfolio of patents in the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery aimed at minimizing the trauma of surgical access by taking advantage of natural orifices to deliver surgical tools to targeted areas.
In December 2013, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the obesity intervention division of Allergan, Inc. The assets acquired were the Lap-Band® System and related laparoscopic surgery accessories (the Surgical product line) and the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System. In conjunction with this purchase agreement, we entered into several agreements whereby Allergan agreed to provide manufacturing and distribution support over a two-year period as we established our own capabilities. Our 2013 acquisition of Allergen’s obesity intervention division included their international sales distribution channel, which continues to be a strategic asset for us. In December 2018, we subsequently divested our assets related to the Surgical product line, including the LapBand system. Currently, over 40% of our revenue is derived from customers outside the United States. 
In December 2016, we completed a business combination (the “Lpath Merger”) with Lpath, Inc. (“Lpath”), a publicly traded company. Following the Lpath Merger, Lpath was renamed “Apollo Endosurgery, Inc.” and our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “APEN.”

Apollo’s Market and Strategy
Our vision is to be the industry leader and preferred technology partner for delivering innovative, cost-effective minimally invasive gastrointestinal and bariatric products that improve patient care. We provide products that advance endoscopic solutions for a wide range of patient needs ranging from gastrointestinal defect closure and stent management to the treatment of obesity. Our endoscopy products allow these solutions to be delivered endolumenally by an endoscopist using a flexible endoscope, thus providing patients with treatment options that are designed to remove or defer the need for traditional surgery. 
Our endoscopy products are designed to treat a variety of gastrointestinal conditions including closure of gastrointestinal defects, managing gastrointestinal complications and the treatment of obesity. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 70% of our total sales related to the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System and X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System products and 29% related to the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System products. 
We believe the addressable global market for intragastric balloons is about $100 million, and the historical addressable market for our endoscopy products is approximately $215 million, consisting of a $175 million primarily U.S. market for advanced upper gastrointestinal defect closure. We intend to expand our future potential addressable market through new indications for our current products, new applications for existing solutions, increased clinical support and increased reimbursement.
We believe that, through the development of our current endoscopic suturing system, the advanced gastrointestinal procedures market, which includes defect closures in both the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, presents an aggregate global market opportunity of approximately $850 million, including the potential U.S. market for polyp removal defect closures, which is expected to be in excess of $500 million. Additionally, we aim to expand the indications for our Orbera and OverStitch products to continue addressing the approximately $3.9 billion global endobariatric weight loss market. 
Our development strategy is to further establish the medical relevancy of our products in areas of unmet medical need, such as addressing the needs of the approximately 10 million U.S. patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. NASH is the leading cause of liver transplants in women and patients over the age of 65. NASH treatment presents a large and growing market opportunity, having grown from $1.9 billion in 2019 to $2.9 billion in 2021 and projected to reach $54 billion by 2027, representing a 59% estimated compound annual growth rate. 
By leveraging our team’s extensive experience to create clinically distinct solutions that improve patient lives, we have created a strong foundation for growth and believe that we are well-positioned to positively impact patient care and address substantial unmet clinical needs in gastrointestinal and weight loss applications. We intend to become a partner of choice for doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems, and payors. We are committed to attracting, engaging, and retaining the best talent in the industry.
We intend to continue to pursue regulatory clearance in key international markets where we believe there is strong market demand for our products to continue to broaden our portfolio of products through internal product development efforts, and will consider acquisitions that complement our current business.
The key elements of our strategy include:
Support the continued adoption of our endoscopy products and establish Apollo as the market leader in GI defect closure and fixation.
We intend to establish endoscopic suturing as a standard of care in GI defect closure and fixation through the continued market penetration of our flagship product, the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System, and the X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System, which we launched in December 2020, expanding the clinical utility of our suturing technology to a larger population of gastrointestinal procedures in the lower GI tract.
Interventional and therapeutic gastroenterology is a high growth area within medicine, and our suturing products are used in both the upper and lower GI tract. Examples of upper GI applications include fistula closure, esophageal stent fixation, and tunnel closure for peroral endoscopic myotomy, or POEM. Fistulas are chronic or acute defects that can form between two sites in the GI tract, cavity or skin, often occurring as a result of abdominal surgery. Esophageal stents are often used as part of the treatment of esophageal blockage from cancers or benign scarring and fixation is designed to prevent the premature migration of the stent, especially in benign conditions, which is common and costly. Clinical evidence shows that fully covered esophageal stents that are not fixed in place will have as high as a 60% migration rate. Suturing stents in place helps reduce stent migration by preventing repeat procedures and complications for the patient. 
In the lower GI tract, there are over 21 million colonoscopies performed annually in the United States alone. Cancer screening followed by the endoscopic resection of complex flat and large polyps can provide patients with an alternative to surgical resections. Delayed bleeding is a general risk of endoscopic resection and patients over the age of 50 are more often on anti-thrombotic (blood thinning) medications which carry a higher risk of bleeding. Suturing the resection site aids in healing and helps prevent delayed bleeding following the procedure.
Currently, we estimate that our products have been used in over 90% of the top 20 research hospitals and top 25 GI specialized hospitals in the U.S. We intend to leverage our clinical experience in these leading academic institutions and hospitals to further penetrate existing accounts, as well as expand our global user base, through clinical research, clinical selling and training, peer-to-peer education programs, industry and society collaborations, product enhancement, new product development initiatives and expanding regulatory indications and obtaining new regulatory approvals in strategic markets.
Create an endoscopic weight loss franchise 
We intend to leverage our unique product portfolio to address the growing global obesity crisis. We believe that our Orbera intragastric balloon and OverStitch system provide a comprehensive set of scalable, safe, effective, organ-sparing solutions. The underlying procedures may be performed in an outpatient facility by either a gastroenterologist or a bariatric surgeon, positioning us to increase market penetration and potentially expand the market for weight loss procedures.
Worldwide obesity numbers have nearly tripled since 1975. More than 650 million people are now considered clinically obese. In the U.S., more than 100 million adults are obese, comprising in excess of 40% of the adult population. Obesity related conditions including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, and certain types of cancer are among the leading causes of preventable, premature death. Obesity costs the U.S. health care system more than $170 billion a year, yet less than 1% of eligible obese patients are treated with bariatric surgical weight loss procedures each year.
Traditional obesity intervention has been bariatric surgery (typically, gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy or gastric banding), which is mostly performed laparoscopically. Today, based on U.S. population demographics and physician society reported bariatric procedure volumes, less than 1% of the population eligible for bariatric surgery elects to have a procedure each year. Based on published surveys, the eligible patients’ primary resistance to bariatric surgery is fear of surgery in general, and more specifically fear associated with the invasive nature of bariatric surgery, permanent anatomical alteration, potential for non-permanent results and the post-operative severe complications that have been reported with bariatric surgery.
Our Orbera intragastric balloon is currently a leading gastric weight loss balloon worldwide, with over 450,000 balloons placed globally to date. We expect to leverage recent market momentum, including clinical practice guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association in 2021 recommending the use of intragastric balloons for obesity management, to drive growth for our Orbera products. 
One of the most promising newly developed weight-loss procedures is commonly referred to as endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (“ESG”). ESG is a minimally-invasive (nonsurgical) weight loss procedure that uses Apollo ESG™ or the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System to transorally reduce the volume of a person’s stomach; similar to the goal of a surgical sleeve gastrectomy procedure but without the invasiveness and need for amputation of a significant portion of the patient’s stomach. The potential advantages of an ESG procedure include maintaining the original structural and functional integrity of the stomach, providing clinically meaningful weight loss, low adverse events, reversibility, short recovery time, and avoidance of surgical incisions. We believe the application of Apollo ESG™ in the U.S. or OverStitch in markets outside the U.S. to bariatric weight loss procedures addresses many of the concerns that patients have about traditional bariatric surgeries. In addition, the ESG procedure has the potential to fill an important clinical gap between diet, exercise and medications for patients with a relatively low BMI and traditional bariatric surgeries that are often reserved for patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m2. To date, there have been more than 6,500 participants studied in ESG clinical trials. Clinically, these trials show average excess body weight loss greater than 50% and a low adverse event rate. In fact, clinical studies of the ESG procedures typically demonstrate a complication rate of less than 2%, whereas published studies of sleeve gastrectomy and RNY gastric bypass surgeries have reported complication rates ranging from 5% to 26%.
In addition, we believe that endoscopic revisions of bariatric surgeries present another potential market for application of our Apollo REVISE™ products. Between 2011 and 2019, over 1.4 million laparoscopic sleeve and gastric bypasses were performed in the U.S. alone. We estimate that 30% to 50% of these are potential revision candidates. In 2019, more than 43,000 revision procedures were performed in the U.S. This revision segment is the fastest growing segment of the traditional bariatric surgery market. In a peer-reviewed study, published in 2021, that compared results at five years, endoscopic revision demonstrated equivalent efficacy and an improved safety profile as compared to surgical revision. We estimate that over 70% of our top 100 accounts in the U.S. are already performing revision procedures.
In July 2022, we announced the marketing authorization of Apollo ESG, Apollo ESG SX, Apollo REVISE and Apollo REVISE Sx Systems through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) De Novo Classification process, a rigorous pre-market review pathway for low-to moderate-risk devices without a predicate. These products are the first and only devices authorized by the FDA for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and endoscopic bariatric revision.
Apollo Products 
The Apollo Endoscopy products consist primarily of the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System, X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System (collectively “ESS”) and the Intragastric Balloon System (most often branded as Orbera). In July 2022, we announced the marketing authorization of the Apollo ESG™, Apollo ESG Sx™, Apollo REVISE™ and Apollo REVISE Sx™ Systems through the FDA De Novo Classification process. These products are the first and only devices authorized by the FDA for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and endoscopic bariatric revision.
OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System
The OverStitch and OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System (“ESS”, “OverStitch” or “Sx”) enables advanced endoscopic procedures from within the GI tract, or endolumenally, by allowing physicians to suture, especially full-thickness, and secure the approximation of tissue. OverStitch and OverStitch Sx are currently one of the few U.S. cleared flexible endoscopic suturing devices capable of full-thickness suturing of tissue. OverStitch is a single-use suturing device that is attached to a flexible endoscope. The flexible endoscope, with the OverStitch device attached, allows a physician to access a patient’s upper and lower GI tract and accurately suture the tissue inside the GI tract for different clinical needs, including a range of defect repairs, esophageal stent fixation to prevent stent migration, and volumetric space reduction. The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA 510(k) clearance in August 2008 and CE Mark in November 2012. The OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System received FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2018 and CE Mark in November 2018.
The OverStitch device that was 510(k) cleared in August 2008 is compatible with a specific dual channel flexible endoscope, sold by Olympus, that has limited market presence, representing less than five percent of the flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world. We have updated the OverStitch labeling to include both Olympus and Fujinon endoscopes as compatible with OverStitch, reducing our reliance on Olympus. Beginning in November 2018, we began the first commercial shipments of the OverStitch Sx that is compatible with four major scope manufacturers and over 20 single-channel flexible endoscopes with diameters ranging from 8.8 mm to 9.8 mm. These Sx compatible single-channel endoscopes represent the majority of flexible endoscopes in hospitals and clinics around the world today.
Since its market introduction in 2008, over 100,000 OverStitch units have been sold for procedures worldwide. We estimate that approximately 60% of OverStitch uses in the U.S. were for advanced gastrointestinal therapies. The other uses were for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, or ESG, approximately 25%, and bariatric revision, approximately 15%. Outside the U.S., we estimate that the majority of OverStitch uses, approximately 65%, were for ESG. The other uses outside the U.S. were for bariatric revision, approximately 20%, and for advanced gastrointestinal therapies, approximately 15%. 
The MERIT-Trial was designed to enroll two hundred patients, stratified into three groups (Obesity, Obesity with hypertension, Obesity with diabetes). The trial has two levels: (1) the randomized study phase with primary outcomes for both treatment and control participants evaluated at twelve months, and (2) the crossover, non-randomized study phase with outcomes for (a) the initial treatment participants at 24 months after their ESG, and (b) the control cross-over participants evaluated at twelve months after their ESG. The MERIT trial subsequently received an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA in 2019. The primary outcomes for the first level procedures of the study are measured after a one-year follow-up period. The final enrolled patient completed their 12-month follow-up during the fourth quarter of 2020. In June 2021, one of the principal investigators of the MERIT trial reported that, based on a preliminary analysis, the MERIT trial had achieved its primary end points for safety and efficacy, and in October 2021, the primary investigators reported on the primary endpoints at a virtual session of the International Society for Surgery of Obesity (IFSO). 
In July of 2022, the MERIT-Trial was published in The Lancet. Key results for patients undergoing ESG include:
•49.2% excess body weight loss at 12 months in the treatment group (vs 3.2% EWL in control); 
•16.3% average total body weight loss in the responder group; 
•68.3% of responders maintained at least 25% EWL at 104 weeks; 
•improvements in quality of life, eating behaviors, and depression; and
•three ESG patients (2.0%) experienced a device or procedure related serious adverse event, all of which resolved and did not require intensive care or surgical intervention. 
During 2017, we entered into a Registry Funding Agreement with the American Gastroenterological Association (“AGA”) Center for GI Innovation and Technology to develop and administer a registry (the “AGA Registry”) to collect real-world evidence related to the safety and efficacy of a number of flexible endoscopic suturing-enabled procedures, including the revision of gastric bypass (known as an outlet revision) who have experienced weight regain after their initial bariatric surgery; the fixation of esophageal stents to prevent migration; and other suturing procedures currently in practice. Enrollment and follow up completed in 2021. The resulting data will be used to present the benefits of endoscopic suturing procedures relative to traditional therapies. The registry was closed and data from the registry has been published. 
During 2018, we established a European multi-center, longitudinal data repository for ESG and outlet revision procedures. This registry collected outcomes for over 1,000 patients enrolled across participating European centers related to procedure safety and effectiveness. In addition, a second, multi-center, retrospective data repository for gastrointestinal applications performed using the OverStitch System was also created. The objective of this registry is to collect European demographic, procedural and outcome data when OverStitch is used during various non-bariatric procedures including closure of full thickness and mucosal defects, post-operative leaks, perforations, stent fixation, treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding and other procedures. The goal is to support the clinical use and benefits of endolumenal suturing as well as provide real-world data on safety and effectiveness which can support physicians, patients and payors in making informed decisions. The registries continue and publications have been generated from both. 
In July 2022, we received marketing authorization for the Apollo ESG™, Apollo ESG Sx™, Apollo REVISE™ and Apollo REVISE Sx™ systems through the FDA’s De Novo Classification process. The Apollo ESG and Apollo ESG Sx Systems are intended to be used by trained gastroenterologists or surgeons to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30 and 50 kg/m2 who have not been able to lose weight or maintain weight loss through more conservative measures. The Apollo REVISE and Apollo REVISE Sx Systems are intended to be used by trained gastroenterologists or surgeons that perform bariatric procedures to facilitate weight loss in adult patients with obesity with BMI between 30 and 50 kg/m2 by enabling transoral outlet reduction (TORe) as a revision to a previous bariatric procedure. The De Novo was approved largely based on the MERIT trial, a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of ESG compared to a medically monitored regimen of diet and healthy lifestyle.
We recently announced the planned introduction of OverStitch NXT, our next-generation single channel endoscopic suturing system. Key features of OverStitch NXT include several enhancements over our current single channel product, OverStitch SX, including:
•expanded range of addressable anatomy; 
•improved physician control of tissue engagement and suturing; and
•intuitive installation; estimated more than 50% faster than our legacy solution.
Since dual channel scopes are often in limited supply and require significant capital outlays, we believe that OverStitch NXT will create multiple opportunities for expanded customer access and adoption in both new and existing accounts. We expect to launch OverStitch NXT in the second half of 2023.
X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System
The X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System (“X-Tack”) is a novel, through-the-scope, suture-based device designed specifically for closing and healing defects in both the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract. The X-Tack device enables physicians to easily address the challenges commonly encountered when closing large or irregularly shaped defects. The procedure involves suture-tethered HeliX Tacks, independently positioned into healthy tissue adjacent to a defect, then cinched to close the construct. X-Tack fulfills a long-expressed need for advanced closure devices to improve healing and address potential adverse events that can occur following standard colonic polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection of complex polyps, such as delayed bleeding or perforation. 
Each X-Tack device enables physicians to place up to four individual HeliX Tacks into healthy tissue adjacent to a defect using a novel Persian drill handle. The HeliX Tack design includes barbs on the coil for enhanced tack fixation. Each HeliX Tack has an eyelet tethering it to a suture. Pulling tension on the suture approximates the HeliX Tacks and, in turn, closes the tissue defect. A suture cinch is then used as the final step to secure the suture in place. Because it offers multiple points of fixation, we believe the X-Tack enhances a physician’s ability to overcome challenges of accurately closing large or irregularly shaped defects. 
In December 2020, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System. We commercially launched the X-Tack system in the U.S. beginning in January 2021. Currently, X-Tack is licensed in ten additional countries, including Brazil, Australia, Israel, Hong Kong, and Thailand. Additional submissions are underway. In December 2022, X-Tack entered review for CE Marking under the European Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”).
The endoscopic removal of upper gastrointestinal and colorectal neoplasia has a 2% risk of perforation and 8-10% risk of delayed bleeding. These two serious adverse events often result in additional endoscopic as well as surgical interventions, hospitalizations, expanded health care costs, and significant distress for both patients and their physicians. The closure of resection sites has been reported to significantly reduce the incidence of these two adverse events and has generated growing advocacy among physician societies. 
Today, closure of polyp resection sites can be accomplished by applying through-the-scope (TTS) metallic (hemostatic) clips, over-the-scope (OTSC) large metallic clips or suturing with our OverStitch device. However, clips have limited use for large wide or irregular shaped defects while suturing requires use of a gastroscope, limiting access to the full length of the colon and also requires removal of the scope from the patient in order to mount the suturing device. 
The X-Tack closure device is intended to resolve the limitations of TTS clips, OTSC and endoscopic suturing by offering functionality through the working channel of any standard gastroscope or colonoscope with precise HeliX Tack placement and tight closure of sites of varying shapes and sizes.
Orbera Intragastric Balloon System
The intragastric balloon system (“IGB”, the “Orbera System” or “Orbera”) is currently marketed under three brands depending on geography: the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System, the BIB, and the Orbera365 Managed Weight Loss System (“Orbera365”). Our IGB is a non-surgical alternative for interventional weight loss. Orbera is the global market leader among intragastric balloons and is available in over 75 countries and more than 450,000 units have been sold worldwide. Our IGB is a single silicone balloon that is filled with saline after its endoscopic placement into the patient’s stomach. Once in the patient’s stomach, the balloon serves to reduce stomach capacity, causing patients to consume less following the procedure, and delay gastric content emptying which assists the patient in losing weight. Placement of the balloon is temporary; at the end of its indwell time it is removed endoscopically, typically, under conscious sedation. 
Outside the U.S., the BIB was CE marked in May 1997 and the Orbera365 was CE marked in August 2017. In the U.S., Orbera was approved by the FDA in August 2015. 
In the U.S., Orbera is indicated for a dwell time in the stomach of up to six months, in adults with a BMI range of 30 to 40 kg/m2, who have tried other weight loss programs, such as supervised diet and exercise, but were unable to lose or maintain weight loss. Outside the U.S., Apollo’s intragastric balloons are generally indicated for similar patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and the labelled dwell times are six months for BIB balloon and twelve months for Orbera365 balloon. All balloons should be removed at or before their labelled dwell time. Outside the U.S., patients with BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2 may also receive a balloon to increase the possibility of long-term weight loss and also to reduce the risk of an anticipated surgery (e.g. obesity surgery, joint replacement, etc.). 
Today, IGBs are frequently used for aesthetic weight loss purposes and because of this, the IGB procedure is typically not covered by insurance and is paid for directly by the patient. While aesthetics is a significant market today for Orbera; we believe that IGB use for medical purposes is a potentially larger opportunity.
Specific to Orbera, there is a substantial and increasing body of evidence that shows that the level of weight loss with Orbera is very effective in the treatment of comorbidities associated with obesity. The clinical effectiveness and safety profile of the Orbera System as a non-ulcerogenic weight loss device has been reported in over 250 peer reviewed publications. Although not specifically indicated for the treatment of any individual obesity-related comorbidities, studies have consistently reported resolution or improvement in a patient’s pre-existing comorbidities at the time of Orbera removal. Orbera is currently the only balloon or other endoscopic product that has been recognized in the ASGE Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations assessment to have met its threshold standards for the treatment of obesity. The meta-analysis performed by the ASGE was based on the aggregation of certain clinical studies conducted outside the U.S. and reported an estimated TBWL at six months of approximately 13.2%. In 2021, the American Gastroenterology Association published clinical practice for Intragastric Balloons in the Management of Obesity. The guidelines suggest the use of intragastric balloons with lifestyle modification over lifestyle modification alone. Furthermore, the guidelines highlight the improvements in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that are associated with a 10% reduction in total body weight loss.
As part of the FDA approval of Orbera, we were required to conduct a post-approval clinical study. The Orbera Post-Approval Study (PAS) was a prospective, multi-center, open-label study of the safety and effectiveness of Orbera as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2. The Orbera PAS completed enrollment in September 2018 with 281 patients treated with Orbera from 11 U.S. clinical study sites. The study’s primary endpoint was a serious adverse event rate of less than 15% and secondary endpoint was total body weight loss of at least 7.5% at the time of Orbera’s removal. All study endpoints were met and our PAS obligation is complete. 
As part of the CE mark approval for Orbera 365, Apollo initiated a post market clinical study, known as the OPTIMA365 study. The OPTIMA365 study aimed to enroll 100 patients at four to five centers in different European countries and to follow those patients for 24 months. The start of this study was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the study experienced a number of delays. However, the first clinical site began enrollment in February 2021. At this time, the study has enrolled 25 patients in Spain. Meanwhile, additional real world data has been identified and collected on the Obera365 balloon. This real world data includes many more patients than the OPTIMA365 study. In the event that our Notified Body determines that MDR requirements for Post Market Follow Up have been satisfied based upon the existing real world evidence and the current results of the OPTIMA365 study, Apollo may terminate additional enrollment and activity under the OPTIMA365 study.
In February 2017, the FDA issued a letter to health care providers related to adverse events following placement of liquid-filled balloons which were not seen during the U.S. pivotal studies, specifically related to events of spontaneous balloon over-inflation and, separately, reports of acute pancreatitis. We subsequently developed updates to Orbera’s product labeling and physician training materials, and these were approved by FDA and implemented in June 2017. The labeling changes included additions to the “Warnings” and “Possible Complications” sections and an update to the “Clinical Evaluations…” sub-section within the “Adverse Events” history for Orbera.
In August 2017, the FDA issued a second update to alert health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred since 2016 in patients with a liquid-filled intragastric balloon implant. Four of the deaths involved patients who had received an Orbera and had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. Following this letter, we worked with the FDA to provide further updates regarding the risks of gastric and esophageal perforation, aspiration, and death and updated the label disclosure for these adverse events as well as the physician training material to provide more detailed descriptions of the patient symptoms that may indicate persistent (or refractory) intolerance, methods of assessing these patients, and recommendations for the management of symptoms and removal of the device.
In June 2018, the FDA approved new Orbera labeling and concurrent with their approval issued a third update to alert health care providers of the label updates and provide an update on new reports worldwide of unanticipated deaths that had been reported since their August 2017 letter to Health Care Providers. Four of the reported deaths in this third update involved patients who had received our IGB product. In each case, the occurrence had been self-reported by us to the FDA as part of our normal product surveillance process. In the period from January 1, 2008 through March 30, 2020, there were 31 reported deaths of patients while they had an Orbera which is an incident rate of less than 0.02% based on the more than 165,000 Orbera balloons distributed during that same time period. 
In April 2020, the FDA issued a fourth update to healthcare providers upon the successful completion of the Orbera PAS. The FDA advised physicians to consider the PAS results and emphasized that patients should be instructed to recognize the symptoms of potentially life-threatening conditions. 
Competition
We are the leading manufacturer of devices for full thickness endoscopic suturing currently on the market in the U.S. or outside the U.S. Other competing technologies for closure during certain GI applications are offered by large and established manufacturers in the GI space including Boston Scientific Corporation, Olympus Medical, Endo Tools Therapeutics S.A., Steris (US Endoscopy) and Cook Medical. Endomina offers a device cleared for endoscopic suturing in the U.S. and in some markets outside the U.S. USGI Medical Inc. manufactures a suture anchor technology for gastric plication and EndoTools offers a device cleared for endoscopic suturing. Outside the U.S., there are a variety of local and regional competitive intragastric balloon manufacturers including SC MedSil, Medicone, Allurion Technologies and Spatz Laboratories. In the U.S., there are two other manufacturers with an intragastric balloon approved by the FDA at this time: ReShape Lifesciences, Inc. and Spatz FGIA Inc.
We are the only manufacturer with a device authorized for performing ESG and endoscopic bariatric revision. We face competition from other interventional therapies for the treatment of obesity. Traditional treatments for weight loss include medications and bariatric surgeries. Recently, a new class of weight-loss medications has come to the market. These medications, which include semaglutide and tirzepatide, offer significantly higher efficacy than prior medications, and these medications are anticipated to achieve widespread utilization. These other therapies are primarily surgical in nature, such as sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy is a surgical weight-loss procedure in which the stomach is reduced to about 15% of its original size by the longitudinal resection and removal of a large portion of the stomach along the greater curvature. The result is a sleeve or tube-like structure. The procedure permanently alters the stomach although weight regain after a few years is common. Gastric bypass surgery refers to a surgical procedure in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch excluding the much larger lower residual stomach and then the small intestine is rerouted to connect to the small upper pouch. The procedure leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food. Both procedures are normally performed laparoscopically and rely upon surgical staplers as their principal surgical tool. As a result, these procedures are supported by the suppliers of surgical staplers, the largest of whom are Johnson & Johnson (Ethicon) and Medtronic (Covidien). 
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products principally to providers of medical services and procedures including hospitals, outpatient surgical centers, clinics and physicians through an employee sales force in the U.S., Australia and certain countries in Europe. In addition, we sell products to third party distributors in certain markets where we have regulatory clearance for our products but do not have employees. In total, our products are offered in over 75 countries. No single customer represents 10% or more of our total revenue. 
Obesity procedures that utilize our Endoscopy products are often cash pay procedures which means the patient must pay for the procedures out of pocket, although there are exceptions. Revisions of prior bariatric surgery using endoscopic suturing are often receiving reimbursement from select payors for patients treated at specific hospitals in the U.S. Some of these same hospitals have also established relationships with select payors for the reimbursement of ESG procedures. Other times, reimbursement occurs on a case-by-case basis following a review of the patient’s specific situation. Medical procedures that utilize endoscopic suturing products in the treatment of GI complications generally receive reimbursement, but coverage can vary by country, state and procedure performed. IGB treatment is reimbursed in some countries for patients who meet certain criteria. 
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We operate a manufacturing facility in the Coyol Free Trade Zone in Alajuela, Costa Rica that performs assembly of select components of the OverStitch system, and final assembly of our new X-Tack System and IGB products. We also have the ability to manufacture select product components and sub-assemblies at our engineering facility in Austin, Texas. We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Austin, Texas and in our Costa Rica facility. In addition, we rely on several third-party suppliers to provide other OverStitch system components. We have identified several gross margin improvement projects intended to lower our product costs and improve capacity utilization of our manufacturing facility over the next three to five years. 
We believe that our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months. Our manufacturing facility is certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operates under the FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”).
Intellectual Property
We have developed and acquired significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval.
We protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.
As of December 31, 2022, we own over 100 U.S. patents and 170 foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2037 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2034 subject to the payment of the requisite renewal fees. We also own 20 pending U.S. patent applications and 27 pending foreign patent applications. We believe patents will be issued pursuant to such applications but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. Where we have acquired or licensed patent rights from third parties, we are generally required to pay royalties. While our patents are an important element of our products and future product development, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent. 
In 2009, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, with Olympus Corporation and the “FTE Group” comprised of The Johns Hopkins University, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, The University of Texas Medical Branch, MUSC Foundation for Research Development and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, whereby the FTE Group has assigned to us a Joint Research Agreement with Olympus Corporation, including their rights in certain inventions, patents and IP rights developed by the FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement, which relate to the field of flexible endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery. Olympus Corporation has retained rights as a joint owner of certain inventions and related patents developed jointly by the FTE Group and Olympus Corporation under the Joint Research Agreement and retained a license granted by the FTE Group to Olympus Corporation to the inventions and related patents developed by the FTE Group under the Joint Research Agreement. The patents covered by the agreement pertain to endoscopic procedures and endoscopic suturing devices that relate to the OverStitch products and may also be incorporated into potential new products that we may develop in the future. As consideration for the assignment, we are obligated to pay to each of Olympus and the FTE Group one half of a royalty in the low single digits on net sales of our products covered by the patents, which royalty shall be reduced if related patents have expired or no longer exist. In addition, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the Joint Research Agreement to the patents and technologies. The term of the Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement is through and until termination. The agreement may be terminated upon written notice a) by Olympus if we materially breach any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice, b) by the FTE Group if we materially breach any of the material terms that pertain to the FTE Group and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice or c) by us if Olympus materially breaches any material terms that pertain to Olympus and the breach is not cured within 30 days after notice.
Following the Lpath Merger, we also own 10 U.S. and 11 foreign issued patents and 2 pending U.S. and 2 foreign patent applications relating to technologies and inventions developed by Lpath prior to the Lpath Merger (the “Lpath IP”). The Lpath IP is not aligned with our current business activities. In January 2018, we entered into a royalty-bearing License Agreement with Echelon Biosciences, Inc., (“Echelon”) under which Echelon may manufacture and sell certain antibody products covered by the Lpath IP for non-clinical research use only, clinical diagnostics and immunohistochemistry. In January 2018 we also entered into a Technology Transfer Agreement with Resolute Pharma, Inc. (“Resolute”) whereby we transferred certain scientific and research materials to Resolute and granted Resolute a license to certain patent rights related to the Lpath IP. Under the terms of the agreement with Resolute, Resolute has obligations to develop and commercialize licensed products and we maintain rights to terminate the agreement if certain development and commercialization milestones are not met. Under the agreement, Resolute is responsible to pay for any ongoing costs and fees associated with the Lpath IP, and we are entitled to a royalty for any revenues related to the Lpath IP including sales of licensed products, and a Tech Transfer Fee of $0.75 million. 
Government Regulation 
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (or “FD&C Act”) also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Device Classification
Under the FD&C Act, medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to either:
•a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 
•another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.
To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured.
Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification, including modification to or deviation from design, manufacturing processes, materials, packaging and sterilization that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA requires a new 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the applicant may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is received. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) or PMA application(s). 
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
The Investigational Device Process
In the U.S., absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product or a specific indication for use. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a 510(k), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
•patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
•patients do not comply with trial protocols;
•patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
•patients experience adverse events;
•patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial;
•device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;
•side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA’s view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or clearance of a 510(k) or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing;
•institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
•third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements;
•third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;
•data collection, monitoring and analysis is not performed in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;
•third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
•regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
•changes in government regulations or administrative actions;
•the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or
•the FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
The PMA Approval Process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application is to take 180 days, although the review generally takes between one and three years, or longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
•the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
•the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
•changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data are submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, components, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket study or surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may require postmarket surveillance for certain devices approved under a PMA or cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility, devices where the failure of which would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, or devices expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•advertising and promotion requirements;
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
•PMA annual reporting requirements;
•PMA approval or clearance of a 510(k) for product modifications;
•medical device reporting (“MDR”), regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health;
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
•unique device identifier and device tracking requirements; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
•We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained authorization to manufacture from the FDA. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA Office of Compliance within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and other healthcare laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, including, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and integrity oversight and reporting obligations.
Anti-Kickback Statute
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including payments to physicians or other providers, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. These exceptions and safe harbors exist for various types of arrangements, including certain investment interests, leases, personal service arrangements, discounts and management contracts. The failure of a particular activity to comply with all requirements of an applicable safe harbor regulation does not mean that the activity violates the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or that prosecution will be pursued. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of the facts and circumstances. Activities and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable exception or safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”).
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statue or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the renumeration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) (discussed below). 
Further, certain states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and do not include comparable exceptions and/or safe harbors to those provided by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
Federal False Claims Act
The FCA prohibits, among other things, knowingly filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. A claim that is filed pursuant to an unlawful kickback may be a false claim under this law and, in a number of cases, manufacturers of medical products have entered into settlements based on FCA allegations that their financial relationships with customers “caused” these customers to submit false claims. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Private individuals can file suits under the FCA on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as “qui tam” actions, and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Since complaints related to “qui tam” actions are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before a defendant is even aware of such action. 
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created new federal crimes, including: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), also protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates as well as their covered subcontractors. HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of patient health information, including patient records. Although we believe that HIPAA does not apply directly to us, most of our customers have significant obligations under HIPAA, and we intend to cooperate with customers and others to ensure compliance with HIPAA with respect to patient information. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to significant penalties if we violate HIPAA. Failure to comply with HIPAA obligations can result in civil fines and/or criminal penalties. Some states have also enacted rigorous laws or regulations protecting the security and privacy of patient information.
Transparency Reporting
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA.
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is part of the ACA, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record payments and transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and to report this data to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. In addition to reporting, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Failure to report may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.
In recent years, the federal government and several states have enacted legislation requiring biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs and file periodic reports on sales, marketing and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. 
Coverage, Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
Patients in the U.S. and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their healthcare treatment. Accordingly, market acceptance of our products is dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from third-party payors, which can differ significantly from payor to payor and may change from time to time. Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment amounts are updated and revised by third-party payors. In cases where the cost of certain of our products are recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed or paid directly by the patient, these updates could directly impact the demand for our products.
All third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the U.S. or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. These cost-control methods include prospective payment systems, bundled payment models, capitated arrangements, group purchasing, benefit redesign, pre-authorization processes and requirements for second opinions prior to major surgery. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our products. Therefore, coverage or reimbursement for medical devices may decrease in the future. In addition, consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions, which may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.
Federal and state governments in the U.S. and outside the U.S. may enact legislation to modify the healthcare system which may result in increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. These reform measures may limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and also indirectly affect the amounts that private payors are willing to pay. The resulting pricing pressure from our hospital and ambulatory surgical center (“ASC”) customers due to cost sensitivities resulting from healthcare cost containment pressures and reimbursement changes could decrease demand for our products, the prices that customers are willing to pay and the frequency of use of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Moreover, in the U.S., there have been several presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. 
International Regulation
Our business is also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which our products are sold. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. 
In order to place a medical device in the European market, a CE mark must be obtained. To obtain a CE Mark, medical devices must meet certain minimum standards of safety and quality and, depending on which class of medical device they fall into, as such classes are defined in the MDR for the new regime, they may need to undergo an appropriate conformity assessment procedure conducted by a Notified Body. A Notified Body will, amongst other things, assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and verify that the subject device conform to the requirements set out in the relevant legislation. Once the appropriate conformity assessment procedure for the medical device has been completed, a declaration of conformity will be created and the manufacturer will affix the CE mark to the device. The device can then be marketed throughout the European Economic Area (being the Member States of the EU, together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Notified bodies may perform surveillance and unannounced audits at the manufacturer and critical suppliers with respect to the devices covered by the certificates issued by them. If non-conformities raised during the audits are not remedied in a timely manner by the manufacturer, the notified body may (partially or wholly) suspend or withdraw the certificate concerned. 
The European Union (“EU”) requires that Apollo Endosurgery’s devices comply with the Medical Device Directive. The Medical Device Directive was replaced by the Regulation 2017/745 on Medical Devices, or the MDR, effective as of May 26, 2021. The MDR contains additional requirements beyond those required to comply with the directives they replace, and often require the submission of more detailed data to support approval. Notably, the requirements for clinical evidence and postmarket surveillance are more rigorous. All affected companies must comply with the MDR as of May 26, 2021, specifically the transition requirements dealing with registration, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance reporting. The company was audited by its Notified Body in February 2022, resulting in successful verification that the Quality Management System meets the current requirements of the MDR. Our legacy products (which includes all products excluding X-Tack) have completed Notified Body review and were transitioned to CE Mark under the MDR in November 2022. X-Tack is currently in review with the Notified Body. 
In the EU, we are also required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products and are subject to regulations and periodic review from various regulatory bodies in other countries where our products are sold. Lack of regulatory compliance in any of these jurisdictions could limit our ability to distribute products in these countries. Additionally, we are subject to foreign laws and regulations governing the marketing and promotion of our products including transparency reporting obligations.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees (such as physicians at state-owned or state-operated hospitals) and are therefore subject to various anti-bribery laws.
Other Regulations
We are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our products is subject to compliance with various international and federal laws and regulations and by various foreign, state and local agencies.
Employee Management and Retention 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 139 employees in the U.S. and 142 outside the U.S. None of our employees are (i) represented by a labor union or (ii) are party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Code of Business Conduct and Business Ethics
We are dedicated to conducting our business consistent with the highest standard of business ethics. Each employee receives and agrees to follow the Apollo Endosurgery Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Employees are encouraged to discuss any related concerns with management or report concerns anonymously through an Ethics Helpline.
Talent Management & Development
We believe that our employees are the foundation of our business and we are committed to the development and retention of our workforce.
Compensation Philosophy
To ensure we are able to attract, retain and develop high performing teams, we engage external compensation advisors to guide our efforts in developing cash and equity rewards programs that are competitive with our peer companies.
Other Benefits
We offer competitive health and welfare programs to support our employees and their families’ physical, mental, and financial well-being.
COVID-19 Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a key focus at our Company. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company established safety protocols, facility enhancements, and work from home strategies to protect our employees. Some of our employees continue to work remotely. Employees that work on site are required to adhere to applicable protocols and to report and document exposures, all following guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control or mandated by local regulations.
