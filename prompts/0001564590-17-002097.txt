ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a commercial stage oncology company developing a profoundly different cancer treatment centered on a proprietary therapy called TTFields, the use of electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt solid tumor cancer cell division.  Our key priorities are to accelerate commercial adoption of Optune, our first commercial TTFields delivery system, for the treatment of glioblastoma (“GBM”) and to advance programs testing the efficacy and safety of TTFields in multiple solid tumor indications through our clinical pipeline.
 We were founded in 2000 and operated as a development stage company through December 31, 2011. We initially received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for Optune in 2011 for use as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with GBM following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy. In October 2015, we received FDA approval to market Optune for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM in combination with temozolomide, a chemotherapy drug. We have also received approval to market Optune in Germany, Switzerland, Japan and certain other countries.  We have built a commercial organization and launched Optune in the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Japan, which we refer to as our currently active markets.  2016 was marked by substantial growth in our business as compared to 2015, driven primarily by the October 2015 FDA approval for Optune in newly diagnosed GBM and the December 2015 publication of the EF-14 trial data in the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”), as further described below.
 We have researched the biological effects of TTFields extensively. Because TTFields are delivered regionally, act only on dividing cells (a biological process to as mitosis) and are frequency tuned to target cancer cells of a specific size, we believe there is minimal damage to healthy cells. We believe our pre-clinical and clinical research demonstrates that TTFields’ mechanism of action affects fundamental aspects of cell division and may have broad applicability across a variety of solid tumors. We have demonstrated in pre-clinical studies that TTFields can offer additive or synergistic benefits in combination with radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, which may lead to greater efficacy than radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy alone, without significantly increasing the side effects when used in combination with other cancer treatments. 
 In addition to our clinical and commercial progress in GBM, we are currently planning or conducting clinical trials evaluating the use of TTFields in brain metastases, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to study the safety and efficacy or TTFields for additional solid tumor indications.
 We own all commercialization rights to TTFields in oncology. Our robust global patent and intellectual property portfolio consists of over 50 issued patents, with numerous additional patent applications pending worldwide. We believe we will maintain exclusive rights to market TTFields for all solid tumor indications in our key markets through the life of our patents. 
 We wereincorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey in 2000.  Our U.S. operations are located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Malvern, Pennsylvania, and New York City. Additionally, we have offices in Germany, Switzerland and Japan, and a research center in Israel.  We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of our ordinary shares in October 2015.   Our ordinary shares are quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “NVCR.”
 Our therapy
 Medical advancements have led to dramatic improvements in cancer survival in the last 50 years. In the United States, five-year survival for all cancers rose from 49% in the 1970s to 69% in this decade. 
 Despite meaningful advancements in cancer treatment, a significant unmet need to improve survival and quality of life remains. Of the 22,280 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. each year, only 46.2% live past five years. Of the 224,390 Americans diagnosed with lung cancer annually, only 17.7% are alive five years later. Of the 12,500 Americans diagnosed with GBM each year, only 9.8% survive five years. Of the 53,070 people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U.S. each year, only 7.7% survive past the five-year mark. We believe we will establish TTFields as a profoundly different approach to cancer treatment for a variety of solid tumors that increases survival without significantly increasing side effects when used in combination with other cancer treatments.
 Through the use of electric fields, we leverage physics to influence the biological process of mitosis, the process by which human cells divide. In 2000, we hypothesized that a distinct type of alternating electrical fields could specifically target growth of tumors, and named them Tumor Treating Fields, or TTFields. After more than a decade of preclinical research in over 15 different cancer cell lines, TTFields have consistently been shown to disrupt mitosis. In our clinical research to date, TTFields have been shown to be safe, with mild to moderate skin irritation being the most common side effect.

Essential to understanding TTFields is recognizing what electric fields are and how they can be utilized for medical applications. All fields exert forces on specific objects that are spatially located inside the field. For example, gravitational fields exert forces on masses, magnetic fields exert forces on iron and electric fields exert forces on polarized molecules. Electric fields at specific frequencies can be used across multiple medical applications. Low frequency or pulsed electric fields can depolarize cell membranes, as seen in artificial pacemakers, while high frequency electric fields can generate heat, as seen in radiofrequency ablation. Intermediate frequency electric fields, long thought to have no significant biological effect, have now been shown to inhibit the growth rate of a variety of cancer cell lines and cause cancer cell death.
 We believe TTFields do not damage non-mitotic cells since the highly charged tubulin and septin proteins, which the TTFields target, are not assembled when a cell is not in mitosis.  TTFields use low-intensity, alternating electric fields tuned to specific intermediate frequencies to disrupt the mitotic process essential to tumor growth. While many intracellular molecules are slightly polarized or neutral, some are highly polarized and are strongly affected by intermediate frequency alternating electric fields. For example, tubulin is a highly polarized molecule in cells that must orient spatially to form the mitotic spindle, which segregates chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis. In the presence of electric fields, tubulin aligns with the direction of the electric field, causing disruption of mitotic spindle formation and eventual cell death. Septin is another highly polarized molecule in cells that must orient spatially to form the contractile ring needed to split daughter cells during mitosis. In the presence of electric fields, septin aligns with the direction of the electric field, leading to improper localization of the contractile ring. This process causes membrane blebbing, a sign of cell damage, and eventual cell death. 
 The biological effects of alternating electric fields are dependent on the frequency of oscillation (kHz) and the field intensity (V/cm). To apply alternating electric fields to the body, two sets of transducer arrays are placed front-to-back and side-to-side to surround the region of treatment. The arrays are connected to an electric field generator. The electric field penetrates the entire volume of tissue surrounded by the arrays and, at the right frequency, enters the cells inside the field. The cell membrane serves as a filter for electric fields unless tuned to a specific frequency, with the frequency required to penetrate the membrane principally linked to cell size. Cancer cells tend to be a different size than surrounding normal healthy cells and, as a result, we believe treatment with TTFields selectively targets cancer cells while minimizing damage to normal cells. Additionally, since the molecules affected by TTFields are primarily those utilized during mitosis, proliferating cancer cells are affected more than resting, non-dividing normal cells. TTFields are regionally delivered to the tumor site rather than systemically delivered throughout the body and, as a result, the parts of the body not covered by TTFields are generally not affected.
 Although it is currently only approved for the treatment of GBM, we believe the basic mechanism behind treatment with TTFields may be broadly applicable to solid tumors and is not limited to a specific tumor type or genetic marker. TTFields is intended principally for use in combination with other standard-of-care cancer treatments. Our preclinical experience to date has demonstrated that combining TTFields with radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy may lead to additive efficacy or stronger efficacy than the effect of either treatment alone, and in some cases synergistic efficacy, or stronger efficacy than the sum of the effects of both treatments. The synergistic effect is most pronounced in pre-clinical studies with certain taxane-based chemotherapies.  Importantly, TTFields do not appear to increase the systemic toxicities of radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy. No dose-limiting cumulative toxicity has been reported with TTFields and we believe the basic mechanism of action is unlikely to result in a cumulative toxic effect. Treatment with TTFields is different than radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy and we believe it can be combined with many of these therapies to enhance efficacy against multiple solid tumor types. 
 Treatment with TTFields is a profoundly different approach to cancer treatment. The mechanism of action – by disrupting polarized intracellular molecules using low-intensity, alternating electric fields – results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death. TTFields have been shown to have a mild side effect profile, and they may be combined with traditional cancer therapies to enhance efficacy without significantly increasing side effects. 
 Our technology
 TTFields are delivered through a portable, medical device. The complete delivery system, which is designed to allow patients to go about their daily activities while receiving continuous cancer treatment, includes a portable electric field generator, transducer arrays, rechargeable batteries and accessories. Sterile, single-use transducer arrays are placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor and connected to the electric field generator to deliver therapy. Transducer arrays are changed when hair growth or the hydrogel reduces array adhesion to the skin, which is typically two to three times per week for our GBM patients. The therapy is designed to be delivered continuously throughout the day and night and efficacy is strongly correlated to compliance. If the device is not on, the patient is not being treated. The electric field generator can be run from a standard power outlet or carried with a battery in a specially designed bag that we provide to patients.
 TTFields penetrate the volume of tissue between the arrays. The distribution of the field within a certain part of the body depends on the exact layout of the transducer arrays and the passive electrical properties, mainly resistance, of the different tissues between them. 
 2


Array placement is optimized for each patient using proprietary software called NovoTAL, based on morphometric measurements of the patient’s anatomy according to a recent MRI scan and the location of the tumor.
 In July 2016, we received FDA approval for the second generation Optune system, designed to make treatment with TTFields more convenient and manageable for GBM patients in order to improve patient compliance and acceptance. The second generation Optune system features a TTFields generator that is less than half the weight and half the size of the generator in the first generation Optune system. Including its battery, the second generation Optune system weighs approximately 2.7 pounds. The second generation Optune system has been available to patients in Germany and Switzerland since October 2015. We have submitted an application, currently under review, to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) to make our second generation Optune system available to patients in Japan and hope to receive approval in 2017. 
 We plan to use the same field generator technology across all indications for which TTFields are approved. We plan to specifically target individual solid tumor types by tuning the field generator to the appropriate frequency based upon tumor cell size and adjusting the output power to treat the required tumor tissue volume. Our transducer arrays have been developed and are in use, either commercially or clinically, for application on the head, chest and abdomen. 
 We plan to continue to enhance our TTFields delivery systems to improve ease of use for patients. We are currently in the final stages of development of a transducer array in a tan color (instead of white) for GBM patients, which is intended to be less conspicuous for patients using Optune. Pending applicable regulatory approvals, we hope to launch the tan transducer array in 2017. We are also working to develop a next generation transducer array intended to minimize the impact of wires and improve overall aesthetics through the use of new materials. 
 Our expenditures on research, development and clinical trials in each of the last three fiscal years are provided in Part II, Item 6 “Selected Financial Data.”
 Our commercial business 
 The first indication we pursued for TTFields was GBM, the most common form of primary brain cancer. GBM are tumors that arise from astrocytes – the star-shaped cells that make up the “glue-like,” or supportive tissue of the brain. These tumors are usually highly malignant because the cells reproduce quickly and they are supported by a large network of blood vessels. GBM is an aggressive disease for which there are few effective treatment options. 
 Since the approval of temozolomide as a chemotherapy treatment in 2005, standard treatment for GBM generally includes maximal debulking surgery, radiation therapy with concomitant low-dose temozolomide and post radiation, high dose temozolomide. Prior to the approval of Optune, the median overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed GBM was approximately 15 months with standard therapies and two-year survival was approximately 30%. Five-year survival was under 10%.
 We initially received FDA approval for Optune in 2011 for use as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with GBM, following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy. In October 2015, we received FDA approval of Optune for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM in combination with temozolomide in this indication. We have also received approval to market Optune in Germany, Switzerland, Japan and certain other countries.  We have built a commercial organization and launched Optune for the treatment of GBM in the United States, Germany, Switzerland and Japan, which we refer to as our currently active markets.  Refer to Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 18, “Supplemental information” for more information regarding our assets and net revenues in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. 
 We estimate that:
  
• | approximately 12,500 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in the United States each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 9,300 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.

• | approximately 3,600 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Germany each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 2,700 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.

• | approximately 1,500 people are diagnosed with GBM or tumors that typically progress to GBM in Japan each year. Of this population, we estimate that approximately 1,100 patients are candidates for treatment with Optune based upon the rate of disease progression and medical eligibility.

EF-11 Clinical Trial Data for the treatment of recurrent GBM
 We received FDA approval in 2011 to market Optune for use as a monotherapy treatment for adult patients with recurrent GBM. The FDA approved Optune based on the EF-11 trial, which was a randomized, active standard of care controlled phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. While the trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of superiority, the trial results indicate that monotherapy treatment with Optune provides patients with clinically comparable extension of survival compared to chemotherapy and that patients treated with Optune alone had significantly fewer side effects and an overall better quality of life than patients treated with chemotherapy alone.
 The EF-11 trial was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), active controlled clinical trial of 237 adults with recurrent GBM. Participants received either TTFields as a monotherapy (n=120) or the physician’s choice of chemotherapy (n=117). Chemotherapies chosen for the active control arm included mainly bevacizumab, nitrosureas and temozolomide. The primary endpoint for the trial was overall survival (“OS”). The secondary endpoints included progression free survival (“PFS”) at six months (“PFS6”), radiological response rate, one-year survival rate, adverse event severity and frequency and quality of life. OS for patients treated with TTFields alone and active chemotherapy were 6.6 months and 6.0 months, respectively (p=0.27: HR = 0.86). PFS was not significantly different between the groups and PFS6 was numerically higher in the TTFields arm (21.4% vs. 15.2%). 
 The EF-11 trial demonstrated that patient compliance is important for successful outcomes. Patients who used TTFields more than 75% of the time had a significant survival advantage compared to those who used it less than 75% of the time (median survival was 7.8 months compared to 4.5 months, respectively; p<0.05).
 Our commercial registry (PRiDe)
 At the time of our initial commercial launch of Optune for recurrent GBM in 2011, we established a patient registry aimed at capturing information related to the use of TTFields in the real-world commercial setting, which we refer to as PRiDe. We collected Optune treatment data and OS data from all 457 recurrent GBM patients who commenced treatment with Optune in the United States between October 2011 and November 2013. Key findings from this peer-reviewed published data include:
  
• | Compelling overall efficacy—Median OS was significantly greater with TTFields in PRiDe than in the EF-11 trial (9.6 months vs. 6.6 months; p=0.0003). OS rates were more than double for TTFields patients in PRiDe than in the EF-11 trial (one-year: 44% vs. 20%; two-year: 30% vs. 9%);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy correlated to compliance—Patients for whom compliance data was available (n=287) who used Optune more than 75% of the time (the recommended minimum is 18 hours per day) had a significant survival advantage compared to those who used it less than 75% of the time (median survival was 13.5 months compared to 4.0 months, respectively; p<0.0001); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consistent safety profile—No unexpected adverse events were detected in PRiDe. As in the EF-11 trial, the most frequent side effects were mild to moderate skin reactions associated with application of the transducer arrays.

 EF-14 Clinical Trial Data for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM
 Concurrent with FDA approval of Optune for newly diagnosed GBM, we launched our marketing campaign, aimed to communicate the significant extension of survival outcomes shown in our phase 3 pivotal EF-14 trial (EF-14) which compared, post radiation, Optune plus temozolomide versus temozolomide alone for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. The primary endpoint of the trial was PFS and a powered secondary endpoint was OS. 
 In the EF-14 interim analysis of the per-protocol population of 315 patients, upon which FDA approval was based, Optune plus temozolomide (“TMZ”) significantly extended median overall survival by 4.9 months from 15.6 months for TMZ alone to 20.5 months for Optune plus TMZ (p=0.0042). Optune plus TMZ also significantly improved progression free survival by 3.2 months (p=0.0013).  Quality of life was maintained with Optune plusTMZ. The EF-14 interim analysis results were published in JAMA in December 2015. In July 2016, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology® (NCCN Guidelines®) for Central Nervous Systems Cancers were updated and now include alternating electric fields therapy (Optune) in combination with TMZ following standard brain radiation therapy with concurrent TMZ as a Category 2A recommended postoperative adjuvant treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM.
 The EF-14 long-term analysis of the intent-to-treat population of 695 patients was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology in November 2016. In the long-term analysis, Optune plus TMZ extended median overall survival by 4.8 months from 16.0 months for TMZ alone to 20.8 months for Optune plus TMZ (p<0.0006: HR 0.65).  Optune plus TMZ extended median progression free survival by 2.7 months from 4.0 months for TMZ alone to 6.7 months for Optune plus TMZ (p<0.0001: HR 0.63), consistent with the interim analysis. Optune plus TMZ demonstrated unprecedented long-term survival compared toTMZ alone

through 4 years. There was a 70% improvement in survival with Optune plus TMZ (17%) versus TMZ alone (10%) at 4 years (p=0.028). 
 The following graph presents the progression-free survival data in the intent-to-treat population from our long-term analysis:

The following graph presents the overall survival data in the intent-to-treat population from our long-term analysis:

The significant extension of progression free and overall survival in patients receiving Optune in combination with TMZ in the EF-14 trial was seen in all patient subgroups and was not specific to any prognostic subgroup or tumor genetic marker. Optune was safely combined with TMZ with no significant increase in serious adverse events compared with TMZ alone. The most common side effect related to Optune was mild to moderate skin irritation.
 Commercial Execution
 Optune is a profoundly different treatment for GBM, and our first commercial priority in each market is to generate awareness. In the United States, we believe we have achieved high levels of awareness amongst neuro-oncologists practicing in academic centers. We remain focused on developing awareness amongst radiation and medical oncologists who see a high volume of GBM  patients outside of the academic center setting. Increasing awareness is also a key focus of our commercial efforts in Germany, Switzerland and Japan. In addition to establishing awareness, our commercial efforts also focus to ensure Optune is perceived as a standard of care for GBM. Healthcare providers must undergo a certification training in order to prescribe Optune.  As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 60 sales force colleagues globally, responsible for promotion to certified prescribers at more than 775 centers, including certified prescribers at 490 clinical centers in the United States, 155 clinical centers in Europe (including 121 in Germany), and 131 clinical 
 5


centers in Japan. Once a certified prescriber decides to use Optune as a treatment option for patients, our efforts shift to ensuring the prescriber has the necessary resources to effectively discuss treatment with Optune with their patients and to complete the prescription process. We believe that, unlike traditional cancer therapies, the patient perception of treatment plays a significant role in determining whether or not a prescription for Optune is written and subsequently filled. Therefore, we have also focused efforts on developing targeted tools to support the physician-patient dialogue and patient education.
 We believe we have the experience, expertise and infrastructure to scale our sales and marketing efforts in our key markets. In addition to our commercial organization, we believe we have established a scalable supply chain.
 We currently operate as a direct-to-patient distributor of Optune in the United States and EMEA. Once an appropriate Optune patient is identified by a certified prescriber, the healthcare provider’s office submits a prescription order form and supporting documentation to us. We employ a team of device support specialists who provide technical training to the patient and caregiver. Once treatment is initiated, we provide 24/7 technical support for patients and caregivers as well as assistance with insurance reimbursement. We also provide the healthcare provider and the patient with a monthly compliance report for monitoring patient use of Optune.  Upon reimbursement approval in Japan, we expect to distribute our product through hospitals and to provide patient support services under a contractual arrangement with the hospital. 
 Prescriptions are a leading indicator of demand. In 2016, 2,808 prescriptions were received , an increase of 58% versus 2015. Of those prescriptions, 2,344 were received in the U.S. and 464 were received outside of the U.S., primarily in Europe. A prescription is a commercial order for Optune that is received from a physician certified to treat patients with TTFields therapy for a patient not previously on TTFields therapy. Orders to renew or extend treatment are not included in this total. The conversion of prescriptions to new patients is driven by the prescription fill rate and the time to fill. In 2016, our prescription fill rate was between 70-75% each quarter. 
 The number of active patients on therapy is our principal revenue driver. There were 1,091 active patients on Optune therapy at December 31, 2016, an increase of 80% versus December 31, 2015. Of the global active patients, there were 835 active patients in the United States and 256 active patients in our EMEA markets. An active patient is a patient who is on TTFields therapy under a commercial prescription order as of the measurement date, including patients who may be on a temporary break from treatment and who plan to resume treatment in less than 60 days. Growth in the number of active patients is a factor of both new patient starts and treatment duration. Median treatment duration differs based upon the clinical diagnosis of the patient. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 54% of prescriptions received were for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Median treatment duration for patients with recurrent GBM was 4.1 months in our published commercial registry data and 8.2 months in the long-term analysis of our EF-14 trial in newly diagnosed GBM.
 Our clinical pipeline
 Based on the results of our pre-clinical research, we have developed a pipeline strategy to advance TTFields through phase 2 pilot and phase 3 pivotal trials across multiple solid tumor types. We anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to apply TTFields to additional solid tumor indications.
 Current Clinical Pipeline

The solid tumor types subject to our phase 2 pilot and phase 3 pivotal trails are described in greater detail below, as well as additional details regarding these trials.

Brain metastases
 Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the place where it first started to another place in the body. In metastasis, cancer cells break away from where they first formed (the primary cancer), travel through the blood or lymph system, and form new tumors (the metastatic tumors) in other parts of the body. The exact incidence of brain metastases is unknown because no national cancer registry documents brain metastases. However, it has been estimated that 98,000 to 170,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year, 75,000 new cases are diagnosed in Europe each year, and 13,000 new cases are diagnosed in Japan each year. Brain metastases occur in roughly 15% of all cancer patients, and we believe that approximately 40% of brain metastases are a result of NSCLC.
 As with GBM, brain metastases are commonly treated with a combination of surgery and radiation. Chemotherapy is often given for the primary tumor, but many chemotherapy agents do not cross the blood brain barrier and are thus ineffective in the treatment of brain metastases. When brain metastases appear, they are either surgically removed or treated with radiation using stereotactic radiosurgery (“SRS”) when possible. Whole brain radiation therapy (“WBRT”), although effective in delaying progression or recurrence of brain metastases when given either before or after SRS, is associated with neurotoxicity with a significant decline in cognitive and emotional functioning. Thus, WBRT is often delayed until later in the disease course and is often used as a last resort. This practice results in a window of unmet need after localized surgery and SRS are used and before WBRT is administered to delay or prevent the additional spread of brain metastases. 
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 In October 2016, we enrolled the first patient in our METIS trial, a phase 3 pivotal trial testing the effectiveness of SRS plus TTFields compared to SRS alone in patients with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. We have opened the trial to 270 patients and anticipate enrolling the last patient in 2019. We anticipate data will be available for presentation approximately 12 months following last patient enrollment. 
 Non-small cell lung cancer
 Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. The incidence of NSCLC is approximately 214,000 new cases annually in the United States, approximately 350,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 95,000 new cases annually in Japan. 
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat NSCLC, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery, which may be curative in a subset of patients, is usually used in early stages of the disease. Since 1991, radiation with a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs has been the first line standard of care for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The standard of care for second line treatment is evolving and may include may include pemetrexed, docetaxel or specific PD-1 inhibitors immunotherapies.
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 In July 2013, we published the results of our phase 2 pilot trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of TTFields in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. The pilot study focused on the effects of treatment with TTFields in combination with standard of care pemetrexed chemotherapy. Results of the pemetrexed Phase 3 FDA registration trial were used as historical controls in this trial.
 A total of 42 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Efficacy results based on 41 evaluable patients showed both PFS and OS for patients receiving TTFields in combination with pemetrexed increased compared to historical control data for pemetrexed alone. Median PFS in the TTFields-treated group was 6.5 months (compared to 2.9 months in pemetrexed historical controls) and median OS was 13.8 months (compared to 8.3 months in historical controls). Adverse events reported in this combination study were comparable to those reported with pemetrexed alone, suggesting minimal added toxicities due to TTFields. 
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 We have developed a protocol for a phase 3 pivotal trial, which we believe incorporates the evolving standard of care for second-line treatment of NSCLC. Our LUNAR trial will examine TTFields in combination with PD-1 inhibitors or docetaxel versus PD-1 inhibitors or docetaxel alone. We enrolled the first patient in our LUNAR trial in February 2017, and the trial is planned to enroll 512 patients. We anticipate data will be available for presentation approximately 18 months following last patient enrollment.

Pancreatic cancer
 Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers: it is the fourth most frequent cause of death from cancer in the United States and causes more than 330,000 deaths worldwide every year. In contrast to the decrease in mortality from other cancers over the past decade, pancreatic cancer death rates have been slowly increasing in the United States. The incidence of pancreatic cancer is 53,000 new cases annually in the United States, approximately 110,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 33,000 new cases annually in Japan.
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat pancreatic cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. For patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer involving encasement of arteries but no extra-pancreatic disease, the standard of care is chemotherapy and radiation with or without surgery. Unfortunately, the majority of cases are diagnosed once the cancer is at a late stage and/or has metastasized to other parts of the body, generally leaving chemotherapy as the only treatment option. 
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 We have completed a phase 2 pilot trial in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the PANOVA trial, examining TTFields in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. 
 The first cohort was a single-arm, open-label, historically-controlled, multi-center trial designed to test the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of TTFields in combination with the chemotherapy gemcitabine. This cohort included 20 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer whose tumors could not be removed surgically and who had not received chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to the clinical trial with a minimum follow-up of six months. Results of the first cohort were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in January 2016. Results of the nab-paclitaxel phase 3 FDA registration trial were used as historical controls in this trial.
 In the first cohort, efficacy results showed that PFS and OS of patients treated with TTFields combined with gemcitabine were more than double those of gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median PFS in the TTFields-treated group was 8.3 months (compared to 3.7 months in gemcitabine historical controls) and median OS was 14.9 months (compared to 6.7 months in gemcitabine historical controls). Median one-year survival was 55% (compared to 22% in gemcitabine historical controls). Thirty percent of the evaluable tumors, or 19 patients in total, had partial responses (compared to 7% with gemcitabine alone) and another 30% had stable disease, which means that the cancer is neither decreasing nor increasing in extent or severity.
 Following the approval of nab-paclitaxel, a taxane-based chemotherapy, for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, we expanded this study to include a second cohort of 20 patients that were treated with TTFields in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Topline results of the second cohort were announced in December 2016. 
 In the second cohort, efficacy results showed that PFS and OS of patients treated with TTFields combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine were more than double those of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine-treated historical controls. Median PFS in the TTFields-treated group was 12.7 months (compared to 5.5 months in nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical controls) and median OS was not yet reached. Median one-year survival was 72% (compared to 35% in nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine historical controls). Forty percent of the evaluable tumors had partial responses (compared to 23% with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine alone) and another 47% had stable disease.
 Safety results from both cohorts suggested that TTFields plus first-line chemotherapies nab-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine may be tolerable and safe in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients reported no serious adverse events related to TTFields.
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 Based on our phase 2 pilot trial results, we expect to commence a phase 3 pivotal trial in 2017. We anticipate data will be available for presentation approximately 18 months following last patient enrollment.
 Ovarian cancer
 In the United States, ovarian cancer accounts for approximately 3% of cancers among women, but causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Ovarian cancer incidence increases with age, and the median age at time of diagnosis is 63 years old. The incidence of ovarian cancer globally is approximately 22,000 new cases annually in the United States, approximately 65,000 new cases annually in Europe, and approximately 9,000 new cases annually in Japan.

Physicians use different combinations of surgery and pharmacological therapies to treat ovarian cancer, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery is usually used in early stages of the disease and is usually combined with chemotherapy, including paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the cancer has spread outside of the ovaries to include regional tissue involvement and/or metastases. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer, but most patients with advanced ovarian cancer will have tumor progression or, more commonly, recurrence. Almost all patients with recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance, and the prognosis for this population remains poor.
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 We have completed a 30 patient phase 2 pilot trial in recurrent ovarian cancer, the INNOVATE trial, examining TTFields in combination with standard of care chemotherapy. This trial was a single-arm, open-label, historically-controlled, multi-center study, designed to test the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of TTFields in combination with weekly paclitaxel. Topline results were announced in December 2016. The paclitaxel control arm from the bevacizumab phase 3 FDA registration trial was used as historical controls in this trial.
 A total of 30 patients were recruited to the study with a minimum follow-up of six months. Safety results suggested that TTFields in combination with weekly paclitaxel may be tolerable and safe as first-line treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Median PFS in the TTFields-treated group was 8.9 months (compared to 3.9 months in paclitaxel-alone historical controls) and median OS was not yet reached.  Median one-year survival was 61%. Efficacy results based on the 30 evaluable patients suggested more than doubling of the PFS and an improvement in OS among patients who received TTFields therapy with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone. We plan to submit this data for presentation at a medical conference in 2017.
 Phase 3 pivotal trial
 Based on our phase 2 pilot trial results, we are developing the trial design for a phase 3 pivotal trial in recurrent ovarian cancer. 
 Mesothelioma
 Malignant mesothelioma is a rare thoracic solid tumor cancer that has been strongly linked to asbestos exposure. It has a long latency period of at least 20-30 years following exposure, and global incidence is still increasing in countries where asbestos is still in use. There are approximately 3,000 new cases of mesothelioma annually in the United States, an estimated incidence of 1,000 new cases annually in Japan and a predicted peak of approximately 9,000 male deaths from mesothelioma in Western Europe that may occur around the year 2018. The prognosis of mesothelioma patients is very poor, with a median OS of approximately 12 months in most reported studies. Mesothelioma is often limited to the thoracic cavity and progresses regionally, making it an attractive target for TTFields.
 Physicians use different combinations of surgery and pharmacological therapies to treat mesothelioma, depending on the stage of the disease. Surgery may be used for patients with early stage disease. However, most cases are diagnosed once the cancer is at a later stage, involving extensive tumor growth and regional lymph node spread, and surgical resection for the treatment of mesothelioma is feasible for only a minority of patients. First line standard of care treatment includes pemetrexed, a chemotherapy, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, including carboplatin or cisplatin. Second-line treatments may include oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or immunotherapies. Despite the many advances in chemotherapy made in recent decades, treatment effectiveness remains very limited.
 Phase 2 pilot trial
 We have an ongoing phase 2 pilot trial, the STELLAR trial, in 80 patients with mesothelioma. The STELLAR trial is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of TTFields in combination with pemetrexed combined with cisplatin or carboplatin in patients with unresectable, previously untreated malignant mesothelioma. The historical control for this trial is the results of the 2003 pemetrexed phase 3 FDA registration trial.
 An interim analysis of the first 42 patients enrolled in the trial with an average follow-up time of 11.5 months was presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer in December 2016. The one-year survival rate of patients treated with TTFields combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin was 80% (compared to 50% in pemetrexed and cisplatin-alone historical controls). Median PFS in the TTFields-treated group was 7.3 months (compared to 5.7 months in pemetrexed and cisplatin-alone historical controls) and one-year survival rate was 79.7% (compared to 50.3% in pemetrexed and cisplatin-alone historical controls). Median OS had not yet been reached. No device-related serious adverse events had been reported to date.

We expect to finish enrollment of the STELLAR trial in 2017 and, with 12 month follow up following last patient enrollment, anticipate data will be available for presentation in 2018. 
 Manufacturing
 We outsource production of all of our system components to qualified partners. Disposable transducer array manufacturing, the dominant activity in our manufacturing supply chain, includes several specialized processes. Production of the durable system components follows standard electronic medical device methodologies.
 We have formal supply agreements with our third-party manufacturing partners. We hold safety stocks of single source components to protect our production capacity.
 We currently source the ceramic discs used in the transducer arrays for Optune from Harris Corporation, which is currently our single-source supplier for these components. We have identified and qualified an additional supplier, and we anticipate entering into a supply agreement with that supplier. Our current agreement with Harris Corporation continues through July 21, 2017.  We currently do not intend to renew this supply agreement under the current terms.  In addition to certain other customary termination rights, Harris Corporation can terminate this agreement with 90 days’ written notice if we breach any of our material obligations under the agreement. Agreements with our other suppliers range from terms of four years to ten years and are terminable by either party, generally between 180 days’ and 12 months’ written notice. See “Risk factors—We depend on single-source suppliers for some of our components. The loss of these suppliers could prevent or delay shipments of Optune, delay our clinical trials or otherwise adversely affect our business.”
 We are developing second sources for all critical materials.  We have qualified a second source for the transducer array subassemblies and transducer array finished assemblies.  These sources are able to ship product for use outside of the United States and will be able to ship product for use within the United States pending regulatory approval.  As noted above, we have qualified a second source for the transducer array ceramic discs and plan to accept the first production shipments in the first half of 2017.  We anticipate that the diversification of the supply chain will both ensure a continuity of supply and reduce costs.  
 Billing and reimbursement
 We provide Optune directly to patients in the United States, Germany and Switzerland following receipt of a prescription order. We bill payers a single monthly fee for a month of therapy and we bear the financial risk of securing payment from patients and third-party payers in these markets. We expect to distribute our product through hospitals in Japan and bill a monthly fee to the hospital for its use. The monthly list price for Optune is $21,000 in the United States and €21,000 in the European Union. 
 As we enter each new market, our commercial activities focus initially on establishing the required in-market infrastructure, certifying physicians to prescribe Optune and obtaining a defined reimbursement pathway. Once a defined reimbursement pathway is established, our commercial efforts turn to increasing adoption.
 As of January 1, 2017, more than 180 million Americans have coverage of Optune for newly diagnosed and/or recurrent GBM. Additionally, we have negotiated contracts to establish Optune as an in-network benefit for more than 130 million American lives. In 2016, between 20 and 25% of our active U.S. patients were beneficiaries of the Medicare fee-for-service program, which has denied coverage for our claims to date, and we are actively appealing these coverage denials.  We are unable to bill our existing Medicare fee-for-service patients for amounts not paid by Medicare.  Therefore, we may absorb the costs of treatment for amounts not paid by Medicare.
 We appeal Medicare coverage denials through the Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) process with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of ALJ cases and as of December 31, 2016 no new cases were being scheduled. Thus, we anticipate that, even if we are successful in winning our appeals, we will experience a significant delay in securing payment for Medicare patients when Medicare’s DME MACs deny coverage for patients who start therapy.  
 The German healthcare reimbursement system is a mix of public and private payers all operating under government regulatory oversight. Medical device-based therapies are eligible for reimbursement under multiple pathways with varying clinical and effectiveness evidence requirements for each pathway. We have submitted an application to the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) to review our proposed reimbursement review pathway for Optune. In Germany, we are currently able to bill healthcare payers for individual cases and each case is evaluated individually on its merits and under the payer’s specific rules for such cases.
 10


Switzerland has a mandatory private social health insurance system and the federal government sets the maximal allowable public price for therapies. We submitted our application to the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland to secure a defined reimbursement rate for Optune based upon the interim analysis of the EF-14 clinical trial data.  We intend to submit a revised reimbursement filing in 2017 to include the long-term analysis of the EF-14 clinical trial data. Until we secure a defined reimbursement rate, payment is not guaranteed.
 Japan operates a universal health insurance system strictly regulated by the government. We are preparing our application to the MHLW to secure a defined reimbursement rate for Optune based on the December 2016 regulatory approval of Optune to treat newly diagnosed GBM. Until we secure MHLW reimbursement approval, our commercial efforts are limited to the privately insured patient population.
 Intellectual property
 We own all commercialization rights to TTFields in oncology.  Our robust global patent and intellectual property portfolio consists of over 50 issued patents, with numerous additional patent applications pending worldwide. The patents have expected expiration dates between 2021 and 2031. We have also filed over 45 additional patent applications that, if issued, may protect aspects of our platform beyond 2034. We believe we will maintain exclusive rights to market TTFields for all solid tumor indications in our key markets through the life of our patents.  However, our reliance on intellectual property involves certain risks, as described under the heading “Risk factors—Risks relating to intellectual property.”
 In addition to our patent portfolio, we further protect our intellectual property by maintaining the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information. Given the length of time and expense associated with bringing delivery systems candidates through development and regulatory approval to the market place, the healthcare industry has traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information for significant new technologies, products and processes. 
 Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own, or the individual is required to assign to us, all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. 
 On February 10, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with the Technion, whereby we agreed to resolve certain potential disputes among us, the Technion and Professor Yoram Palti, our Chief Technology Officer and a member of our board of directors, arising out of certain intellectual property that Professor Palti developed while affiliated with the Technion and that Professor Palti has assigned to us. In settlement of these potential disputes, we agreed to pay the Technion an aggregate of $7.5 million, including $1.0 million that was paid on the date of the agreement, an additional $1.0 million that was paid upon the completion of the IPO and an additional $5.5 million that will be payable within five business days (1) if we achieve $250.0 million of cumulative net sales since inception at the end of any given quarter or (2) upon consummation of an M&A transaction, which includes any merger to the extent it involves a change of control, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or shares, the sale of or exclusive license to our intellectual property or a similar transaction. 
 In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we granted the Technion an option to acquire an additional 1,005,210 ordinary shares at any time upon the first to occur of (1) 12 months following the IPO or (2) immediately prior to the sale of the company for cash or publicly traded stock. There was no exercise price on this option. Technion exercised its option in October 2016 and, accordingly, we issued 1,005,210 ordinary shares to Technion in October 2016. No royalties are owed to the Technion or Professor Palti. 
 In 2005, we granted an exclusive license to a third party, NovoBiotic LLC, to certain of our key intellectual property for use outside the field of oncology. We are not entitled to any future revenues from this license. 
 Competition
 The market for cancer treatments is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product and treatment introductions and other activities of industry participants. The general bases of competition are overall effectiveness, side effect profile, availability of reimbursement and general market acceptance of a product as a suitable cancer treatment.
 We believe our intellectual property rights would provide an obstacle to the introduction of TTFields delivery systems by a competitor, and we intend to protect and enforce our intellectual property. In addition, even after the expiration of our U.S. patents, 
 11


potential market entrants applying low-intensity, alternating electric fields to solid tumors in the United States will have to undertake their own clinical trials and regulatory submissions to prove equivalence to TTFields, a necessary step in receiving regulatory approvals for a competing product.
 Presently, the traditional biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expend significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, including GBM and the other indications that we are currently investigating. As we work to increase market acceptance of TTFields, we compete with companies commercializing or investigating immunotherapies, targeted therapies and other anti-cancer therapies, some of which are in clinical trials for GBM that currently specifically exclude patients who have been or are being treated with TTFields.  
 Government regulation
 Our delivery systems and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and by agencies and notified bodies of the countries or regions in which we develop and market our delivery systems. In addition, our delivery systems must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international standards that govern the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, certification, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export and marketing and distribution, among other things, of TTFields and our delivery systems.
 In the U.S., advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to unfair competition based on advertising claims. In addition, we are required to meet regulatory requirements in countries outside the United States, which can change rapidly with relatively short notice.
 Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. 
 Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in any number of regulatory enforcement actions, or civil or criminal liability.
 Food and Drug Administration
 The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution and service of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad.
 The FDA governs the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf:
  
• | product design, development and manufacture;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | product marketing, sales and distribution; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have registered three of our facilities with the FDA. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other regulations and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
 FDA’s premarket clearance and approval requirements
 Unless an exemption applies, before we can commercially distribute medical devices in the United States, we must obtain, depending on the type of device, either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process 
 12


is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, requiring PMA approval.
 Premarket approval (PMA) pathway
 Optune, which is the only delivery system we have marketed in the United States, is classified as a Class III device as it is deemed a life-sustaining device. Accordingly, we were required to receive PMA approval for Optune, which the FDA granted in April 2011 and October 2015 for the treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed GBM, respectively, in adult patients. We expect that we will be required to receive PMA approval for future indications (and the applicable delivery systems for such indications) using TTFields. 
 A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including from technical tests, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing information and intended labeling to demonstrate, to the FDA’s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of a medical device for its intended use. During the PMA review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with QSRs. Prior to approval of the Optune PMA for the treatment of recurrent GBM, we and our critical component suppliers were each inspected by the FDA. 
 New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of our delivery systems, including, for example, certain types of modifications to a delivery system’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require any or as extensive clinical data as the original PMA required, or the convening of an advisory panel. The FDA requires a company to make the determination as to whether a new PMA or PMA supplement application is to be filed. If a company determines that neither a new PMA or PMA supplement application is required for modifications, it must nevertheless notify the FDA of these modifications in its PMA Annual Report. The FDA may review a company’s decisions when reviewing the PMA Annual Report and require the filing of an application. 
 We have received approval for a number of PMA supplements since approval of the PMA for recurrent GBM, including for modifications to Optune’s electric field generator, transducer arrays, software, manufacturing processes and labeling. In October 2015, we received FDA approval to expand our label for Optune to include the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. Most recently, in July 2016, we received FDA approval for our second generation Optune system. Future modifications may be considered by us as the need arises, some of which we may deem to require a PMA supplement application and others to require reporting in our PMA Annual Report. 
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA. Such trials generally require an investigational device exemption application (“IDE”) approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (“IRB”) for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the patients’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the respective IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the United States.
 Post-approval studies are also typically required as a condition of PMA approval to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Such studies are conducted in the post-market setting with the approved device, often to address the long-term use of the device or other discrete questions that may have been raised based on the clinical data from the IDE clinical study. The FDA required a post-approval study as a condition of approval for Optune for recurrent GBM. We have obtained approval of the protocol for this study and are currently enrolling patients.
 13


Foreign approvals and CE mark
 Sales and marketing of medical devices outside of the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These include the requirement to affix a CE mark to our medical devices in the European Union. Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, our delivery systems must be subject to conformity assessment procedure in which a notified body can be involved. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a declaration of conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body typically audits and examines products’ technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the relevant Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate of Conformity, we can draw up a declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the delivery systems covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the declaration of conformity. The time required to CE mark our delivery systems or to obtain approval from other foreign authorities may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Pursuant to a mutual recognition agreement, our products bearing a CE mark may be exported to Switzerland. In the European Union, a clinical study must receive a positive opinion from a local ethics committee and approval from the competent authority in the applicable EU member states in which the clinical study is conducted. When a clinical study relates to a CE marked medical device that will be used as part of the study according to its CE mark intended purpose, the approval of the competent authorities is not required. In Japan, we must obtain approvals from the MHLW to market our delivery systems. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all the risks associated with FDA regulation, as well as country-specific regulations.
 Pervasive and continuing regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
  
• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process for products marketed in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA and equivalent foreign competent authority requiring promotion is truthful and non-misleading and prohibiting the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our delivery systems that has been approved or is the subject of a CE Certificate of Conformity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting regulations of the FDCA and medical device vigilance, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA or equivalent foreign competent authority requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s and equivalent foreign competent authority’s recall authority, whereby they can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign laws, which require reporting of payments and other transfers of value to healthcare practitioners periodically;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | notices of corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------

 Our delivery systems could be subject to voluntary recall if we, the FDA or an equivalent foreign competent authority determine, for any reason, that our delivery systems pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our delivery system would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections include the manufacturing facilities of our 
 14


subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other equivalent foreign authorities, which may result in sanctions, including, but not limited to:
  
• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement and/or refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our delivery systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying our requests for approval of delivery system candidates or a modified version of Optune;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of PMA approvals or suspension, variation or withdrawal of CE Certificates of Conformity that have already been granted;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our delivery systems; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | civil and/or criminal prosecution by the United States Department of Justice.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To date, our facility and those of our critical suppliers have been inspected by the FDA in order to obtain FDA approval of Optune. We and one of our critical component suppliers also were inspected by the FDA in 2012 and 2015. Another one of our suppliers was inspected in the fall of 2013. No inspectional observations were identified and no FDA Form 483s were issued following these inspections.
 DME accreditation and licensing and other requirements
 We are subject to accreditation and licensing requirements as a DME supplier in most states and must meet the supplier standards of Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs. Certain states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding accreditation and licensure requirements, if were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our accreditation or licensure in that state or our supplier rights with that federal program, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future delivery systems to patients in that state or to that federal program.
 Healthcare regulatory matters
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of medical devices, several other types of U.S. federal and state laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry and penalize unlawful conduct. These laws include anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims statutes.
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce ordering, purchasing or recommending of a medical device may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. In some cases, our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.
 As a DME supplier, we also are subject to a U.S. federal self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark law, which prohibits Medicare payments for DME ordered by physicians who, personally or through an immediate family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the furnishing supplier. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions that, if met, permit physicians who have certain financial relationships with a DME supplier to make referrals to that entity.
 The False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The government has pursued a number of cases under the False Claims Act in connection with the off-label promotion of medical products and various other health care law violations.
 15


The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payer.
 Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. We believe we are in substantial compliance with such applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA.
 HIPAA also included a number of federal criminal provisions, including for healthcare fraud and for false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud provision prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements provision prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Many states have similar healthcare fraud laws or insurance fraud laws that apply to claims for healthcare reimbursement.
 Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.
 Legislation similar to U.S. anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims statutes have been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
 The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals or medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals, which are defined as Covered Recipients. The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by the 90th day of each subsequent year. We have adopted policies and codes of conduct regarding our interactions with Covered Recipients and believe we are in material compliance with the Sunshine Act. However, our failure to adhere to these requirements could materially adversely impact our business and financial results.  Additionally, regulations similar to the Sunshine Act have been adopted in foreign countries including a number of EU member states.
 In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business outside the United States or to influence a person working in an official capacity in a foreign country. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity.  Legislation similar to the FCPA has been adopted in foreign countries, including a number of EU member states.
