ITEM 1. BUSINESS
IMPACTS OF COVID-19
 
LIKE MANY BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY, ACQUIRED SALES CORP. (SOMETIMES “AQSP” OR “ACQUIRED SALES”) AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY LIFTED LIQUIDS, INC. D/B/A LIFTED MADE (SOMETIMES “LIFTED” OR “LIFTED MADE”) ARE FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED AND HIGHLY RISKY BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS KNOWN AS COVID-19.
 
THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON ACQUIRED SALES CORP., ON LIFTED MADE, AND ON LIFTED MADE'S OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, RAW GOODS AND PACKAGING SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, CUSTOMERS, SALES AND NET INCOME COULD BE DISASTROUS FOR OUR COMPANY. AMONG THE MANY POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS IMPACTS OF COVID-19:
 
·
THE U.S. ECONOMY MAY BE PUSHED INTO A DEEP RECESSION OR DEPRESSION THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE
·
ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE COULD LOSE SOME OR ALL OF OUR KEY DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES, WHO MAY BE IRREPLACEABLE
·
LIFTED MADE COULD BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY RAW GOODS AND PACKAGING MATERIALS NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS, OR OBTAINING HIGH QUALITY RAW GOODS AND PACKAGING MATERIALS COULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND/OR DELAYED
·
LIFTED MADE COULD BE UNABLE TO DISTRIBUTE OR SELL ITS PRODUCTS PROFITABLY, IF AT ALL
·
U.S. CONSUMERS COULD BE SO FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED THAT THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT PURCHASE LIFTED MADE'S PRODUCTS 
·
U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAY IMPOSE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT LIFTED MADE FROM OPERATING PROFITABLY, IF AT ALL, OR THAT EFFECTIVELY LIMIT LIFTED MADE’S EMPLOYEES FROM PERFORMING THEIR WORK FOR LIFTED MADE IN A NORMAL AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER
·
THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND ECONOMY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AS THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY, WHICH MAY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS UPON ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE THAT CANNOT PRESENTLY BE ESTIMATED OR PREDICTED 
·
LIFTED MADE COULD EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL LOSSES NOT COVERED BY ANY INSURANCE 

NO ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER CAN BE GIVEN THAT ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE WOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID THESE POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS IMPACTS OF COVID-19. CONSEQUENTLY, ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE COULD RUN OUT OF MONEY AND COULD BECOME INSOLVENT OR BANKRUPT AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COMPANY AND ON THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. 
 
THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE DURING 2020. AMONG OTHER THINGS, VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN THE CANNABINOID INDUSTRY DURING 2020. WHILE LIFTED MADE’S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS PERFORMED BETTER DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2020, COMPARED TO DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020, NO ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER CAN BE GIVEN AS TO HOW LIFTED MADE’S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WILL PERFORM DURING 2021. MANY DISTRIBUTORS, RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS IN THE CANNABINOID AND VAPE INDUSTRIES APPEAR TO BE FINANCIALLY DISTRESSED, AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS’ AND RETAILERS’ PURCHASES AND PAYMENTS FOR LIFTED MADE’S PRODUCTS ARE BEING MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED.
 
WHILE DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN VACCINES IN REGARD TO COVID-19 HAS BEGUN, NO ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER CAN BE GIVEN AS TO WHAT IMPACT THESE VACCINES WILL HAVE. IN PARTICULAR, NO ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER CAN BE GIVEN AS TO HOW THE ANTICIPATED “SECOND WAVE” OF COVID-19, AND HOW EMERGING/MUTATED STRAINS OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS, WILL PLAY OUT AND IMPACT ACQUIRED SALES CORP., LIFTED MADE, LIFTED MADE'S OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, RAW GOODS AND PACKAGING SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, CUSTOMERS, SALES AND NET INCOME, OR THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.
 
DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2020, THE SOLVENCY AND CASH FLOW OF OUR LIFTED 

3

MADE SUBSIDIARY AND ACQUIRED SALES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT UPON THE RE-SALE OF HAND SANITIZER TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, AND UPON THE RECEIPT BY LIFTED MADE OF $149,622.50 BORROWED FROM THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRIATION (“SBA”) UNDER THE SBA’S PAYROLL PROTECTION PROGRAM (THE “PPP LOAN”) AND UPON THE RECEIPT BY LIFTED MADE OF $10,000 GRANTED TO IT BY THE SBA UNDER THE SBA’S ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOAN PROGRAM. SUCH RE-SALES OF HAND SANITIZER ARE UNLIKELY TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, AND THE PPP LOAN MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE REPAID. CONSEQUENTLY, LIFTED MADE’S AND ACQUIRED SALES’ FUTURE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN, AND NO GUARANTEE OR ASSURANCE WHATSOEVER CAN BE MADE THAT LIFTED MADE AND ACQUIRED SALES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE IN THE FUTURE.
 
DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2020, THE SOLVENCY AND CASH FLOW OF OUR LIFTED MADE SUBSIDIARY AND ACQUIRED SALES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT UPON THE SALE OF HEMP-DERIVED DELTA-8-THC PRODUCTS. U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES MAY IMPOSE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT EFFECTIVELY PROHIBIT LIFTED MADE FROM SELLING DELTA-8-THC PRODUCTS. CONSEQUENTLY, LIFTED MADE’S AND ACQUIRED SALES’ FUTURE FINANCIAL PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN, AND NO GUARANTEE OR ASSURANCE WHATSOEVER CAN BE MADE THAT LIFTED MADE AND ACQUIRED SALES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE IN THE FUTURE.
 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING DESCRIBED RISKS, AS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS IN THE CANNABINOID INDUSTRY HAVE PERFORMED BETTER, AND AS LIFTED MADE’S SALES OF DELTA-8-THC PRODUCTS HAVE ACCELERATED, DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2020, COMPARED TO DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020, THE CONSOLIDATED CASH ON HAND OF ACQUIRED SALES CORP. AND LIFTED MADE HAS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND AS OF MARCH 27, 2021, WAS A TOTAL OF $761,707. TO DATE, LIFTED MADE HAS ALSO INVESTED CASH OF $587,500 INTO A COMPANY CALLED SMPLYLIFTED LLC, WHICH SMPLYLIFTED LLC HAS PRIMARLY USED TO PURCHASE INVENTORY CONSISTING OF TOBACCO-FREE NICOTINE POUCHES. LIFTED MADE EXPECTS TO INVEST ADDITIONAL CASH INTO SMPLYLIFTED LLC, ALSO TO BE USED TO PRIMARILY PURCHASE INVENTORY OF TOBACCO-FREE NICOTINE POUCHES. LIFTED MADE HAS A 50% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN SMPLYLIFTED LLC.
 
Material Damage to Lifted's Business Resulting From the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic: 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications, including Illinois Governor Pritzker's Executive Order in response to the pandemic, have materially damaged Lifted's business, among other things by disrupting Lifted's access to its employees, suppliers, packaging, distributors and customers. That is why Lifted applied for and received funding under the federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan program and the federal Paycheck Protection Program (collectively the "Federal Financial Assistance").
 
Expectations to Continue as a Going Concern: 
 
Notwithstanding the material damage to our business described above, the management of Lifted currently expects Lifted to continue as a going concern during the 12 months following the date of this report, for the following reasons:
 ·
Lifted’s sales over the past two quarters plus the Federal Financial Assistance has significantly increased Lifted's liquidity. 
As of March 27, 2021, the consolidated cash on hand of Acquired Sales Corp., Younite Corp. and Lifted Made was a total of $761,707, including the Federal Financial Assistance. This total consolidated cash on hand of $761,707 is significant. To date, Lifted has also invested cash of $587,500 into a company called SmplyLifted LLC, which SmplyLifted LLC has used to purchase inventory of tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Lifted expects to invest additional cash into SmplyLifted LLC, also to be primarily used to purchase inventory of tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Lifted has a 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC. 
 ·
As of today, Lifted’s current assets significantly outweigh Lifted's current liabilities. However, we do owe a total of $350,000 in management bonuses to Gerard M. Jacobs, Acquired Sales Corp.’s CEO, and to William C. “Jake” Jacobs, Acquired Sales Corp.’s President and CFO, and we currently do not have the money to pay these bonuses, which are payable upon demand. At any time on or after January 1, 2021, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs also have the right to demand payment of a total of an additional $350,000 in management bonuses (for a total of $700,000 in management bonuses), plus accrued interest at 2% annually commencing January 1, 2021, and we currently do not have the money to pay these bonuses either, which are payable upon demand. Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs are entitled to these bonuses and could demand payment of them. 
 ·
When Lifted's core business of manufacturing, packaging, selling and distributing cannabinoid-infused products was materially damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications, Lifted diverted a significant portion of its available human and financial capital toward a new line of business selling, re-selling, brokering and distributing hand sanitizer. This 

4

hand sanitizer business was significant for Lifted during the second and third quarters of 2020. However, the national supply of hand sanitizer has increased, and this business is not expected to be significant for Lifted going forward.
 ·
During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the demand by distributors for Lifted’s Urb Finest Flowers (“Urb”) brand of hemp and hemp-derived products has gradually increased. However, other companies may attempt to copy the Urb brand's innovative and colorful packaging and products and thus create more competition against Lifted's Urb products, over time. 
 ·
Lifted has commenced selling hemp-derived delta-8-THC 
cartridges, gummies, chocolate, dabs, caviar cones, saucy dmnds, CBG delta-8-THC flower, and a disposable delta-8-THC vape. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, Lifted’s sales of hemp-derived delta-8-THC products has accelerated, and has become a very significant percentage of Lifted’s business. However, the competition against Lifted’s hemp-derived delta-8-THC products is increasing, and pricing is under pressure. In addition, hemp-derived delta-8-THC products may be illegal in certain states, and additional federal, state and/or local prohibitions or restrictions may be imposed on hemp-derived delta-8-THC products. In particular, a recent DEA statement has been interpreted by some as prohibiting the sale of certain hemp-derived delta-8-THC products. Any inability to sell hemp-derived delta-8-THC products would have a material adverse impact on Lifted’s business and on the trading price of Acquired Sales Corp.’s common stock. 
 ·
Lifted’s operations, currently located in Zion, Illinois, need to be relocated to a space that does not have any local zoning uncertainties or other municipal objections to Lifted’s business, and that is air conditioned and sufficiently large to accommodate expansion. Lifted has entered into a multi-year lease of a building located in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and intends to gradually move into this building during the first quarter of 2021. Any failure or inability to complete this move for any reason would have a material adverse impact on Lifted’s business and on the trading price of Acquired Sales Corp.’s common stock. 
 ·
Lifted is involved in the distribution of disposable e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and Lifted owns 50% of SmplyLifted LLC, which sells tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Tobacco-based nicotine products and non-tobacco based nicotine products are subject to extensive regulations and in some cases are subject to federal, state and/or local prohibitions or restrictions. 
 ·
Lifted is taking proactive steps to attempt to gain brand awareness and drive more direct-to-consumer sales online. Lifted has used public relations firms to assist with Lifted’s public relations efforts. Lifted has also hired a firm specializing in SEO to assist with Lifted’s organic search engine rankings. 
However, Lifted has also experienced outages of its website, which may be due hacking and/or sabotage, which has hurt Lifted’s online sales and presumably has also negatively impacted Lifted’s perception with certain consumers. 
 ·
Some of the products that Lifted sells or re-sells are manufactured by third parties who, in certain instances, have experienced significant challenges in manufacturing high quality products. This has negatively impacted Lifted’s perception with certain distributors, retailers and consumers. 
 
Lifted plans to take actions to continue as a going concern, if necessary:
 
If the COVID-19 pandemic and its ramifications, or if other events and circumstances adverse to Lifted's business, challenge Lifted’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that AQSP’s consolidated financial statements are issued, then we would plan to sustain Lifted as a going concern by taking one or more of the following actions: 
 ·
causing Lifted’s parent company AQSP to complete private placements of AQSP's common stock and/or preferred stock 
 ·
borrowing from banks and/or private investors 
 ·
acquiring and/or developing profitable businesses that will create positive income from operations 
 ·
causing Lifted’s parent company AQSP to accrue rather than pay dividends on AQSP's outstanding preferred stock 
 ·
selling the 4.99% of the ownership of Ablis Holding Company, Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc. that is owned by Acquired Sales Corp. 
 We believe that by taking some combination of these actions, Lifted should be able to be provided with sufficient capital, future operations and cash flow to continue as a going concern. However, there can be no assurances or guarantees that Lifted will be successful in consummating such actions on acceptable terms, if at all, and that is why in AQSP's filings with the SEC we are careful to include a "going concern" risk.
 
PLEASE ALSO CONSIDER "RISK FACTORS RELATING TO LIFTED AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING “Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the novel coronavirus, may disrupt consumption and trade patterns, supply chains, and production processes, which could materially affect Lifted’s and target companies’ operations and results of operations", BELOW.
 
Description of the Business of Acquired Sales Corp.
 
Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. Shares of the Company’s common stock are traded on the OTCQX Best Market under the trading symbol AQSP.
 
Our business is primarily engaged in the identification, structuring and seeking to execute on acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture, sale and distribution of hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products such as beverages, shots, water, other liquids, water soluble nano drops or liquids, lotions, sprays, conditioners, creams, oils, pre-rolled 

5

hemp joints and hemp cigarettes, caviar cones, dabs, cartridges, gummies, saucy dmnds, CBG delta-8-THC flower, disposable delta-8-THC vapes, tinctures, powder, water packets, effervescent tablets, capsules, bath bombs, balms, body washes, gummies, food, chocolate, other edibles, and non-prescription cannabinoid formulations (a “Canna-Infused Products Company”). Our business also involves selling and distributing products containing nicotine. During 2020, our business also involved selling and distributing hand sanitizer, but it is unlikely that this hand sanitizer business will continue going forward. 
 
Management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring operating businesses and/or assets involving products containing marijuana, distilled spirits, beer, wine, and real estate. 
 
In addition, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are considered to be “essential” businesses which are unlikely to be shut down by the government during pandemics such as COVID-19.
 
To date, we have acquired 100% of the ownership interests in one Canna-Infused Products Company now called Lifted Liquids, Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids), 4.99% of the ownership interests in a second Canna-Infused Products Company called Ablis Holding Company ("Ablis"), and 4.99% of the ownership interests in two other businesses that manufacture distilled spirits called Bendistillery Inc. ("Bendistillery") and Bend Spirits, Inc. ("Bend Spirits").
 
We have also terminated a planned acquisition of a Canna-Infused Products Company called CBD Lion LLC.
 
At this point in time, we are in discussions with certain companies in our acquisition pipeline. However, our cash on hand is currently limited, so in order to close future acquisitions it is highly likely that it will be necessary for us to raise additional capital, and no guarantee or assurance can be made that such capital can be raised on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Acquisition of 100% of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly d/b/a Lifted Liquids)
 
On February 24, 2020 we closed on the acquisition of 100% of the ownership of CBD-infused products maker Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly d/b/a Lifted Liquids) of Zion, Illinois (the “Merger”), for consideration of (1) $3,750,000 in cash, (2) $3,750,000 in the form of a secured promissory note, (3) 3,900,455 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company (the "Stock Consideration"), (4) 645,000 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company that constitute deferred contingent compensation to be issued and delivered to certain persons specified by Nicholas S. Warrender in a schedule delivered by Nicholas S. Warrender to the Company at the closing of the Merger (the "Deferred Contingent Stock"), and (5) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,820,000 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $5.00 per share that will be issued and delivered to certain persons specified by Nicholas S. Warrender in a schedule delivered by Nicholas S. Warrender to the Company at the closing of the Merger (the "Warrants"). 
 
Pursuant to the Merger, Lifted Liquids, Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made, an Illinois corporation ("Lifted" or "Lifted Made"), is now operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, led by Nicholas S. Warrender as Lifted's CEO and also as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Acquired Sales.
 
Nicholas S. Warrender shall, subject to certain conditions, enjoy so-called “piggyback registration rights” and "demand registration rights" in regard to the Stock Consideration, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement.
 
Ownership of 4.99% of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits
 
On April 30, 2019, we closed on the acquisition of 4.99% of the common stock of each of CBD-infused beverages maker Ablis, and of distilled spirits manufacturers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, all of Bend, Oregon.
The Lifted Made Business
 
Prior to acquiring 100% of Lifted on February 24, 2020, we did not own 100% of any other operating company, so the Lifted Merger was highly significant to our Company. 
History 
 
Lifted was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin on September 19, 2014. Lifted was created with a passion to build a culture-based organization focused upon quality products and a healthier lifestyle. 
 
Products
 
Lifted produces its own lines of products and private labelled products made with hemp, hemp flower, and hemp-derived cannabinoids including delta-8-THC, CBD, CBG and CBN.

Officers and Employees
 
The executives of Lifted have backgrounds in the vaping industry, graphic design, marketing, and supply chain management, skills that have helped Lifted distinguish itself from the competition. Prior to COVID-19, the Lifted team occasionally attended trade shows throughout the USA to promote Lifted’s products and brand, and in support of Lifted’s private label clients. Lifted sometimes evaluates new products by introducing them to potential customers at certain vape shops in Wisconsin and Illinois which are partly owned by Nicholas S. Warrender. The Company holds an option to purchase Mr. Warrender's interests in such vape shops for a nominal price.
 
Lifted currently has approximately 46 full time and part time employees and independent contractors who are engaged in product formulation, design and branding, website development, private label client management, sales, distribution, supply chain management, new business development, warehouse management and order fulfillment, operations management, accounting, new product development, trade shows and evaluation of potential acquisitions and joint ventures. Most of Lifted’s employees are based in Kenosha, WI, and Zion, IL, and the rest are located in Florida, Louisiana and California. Lifted’s independent contractors are located in California, Florida, Utah, Colorado and Rhode Island.
 
Description of Property
 
Acquired Sales Corp.’s CEO Gerard M. Jacobs and its President and CFO William C. Jacobs live in Florida, and Acquired Sales Corp.’s COO lives in Wisconsin. The Company currently does not have a dedicated corporate office for Acquired Sales Corp. other than in the home office spaces provided by the Company’s CEO and President in Florida. The future location of Acquired Sales Corp.’s corporate office will depend upon a number of factors including where our CEO is living at the time. 
 
Lifted does not own any physical properties. Lifted’s corporate office, manufacturing facility and warehouse is located in Zion, Illinois, where Lifted has rented 3,300 square feet of space under a lease that terminates on June 1, 2021. Lifted is currently temporarily using additional space located adjacent to its rented space and is making payments in lieu of rent therefor. 
 
As reported in Acquired Sales Corp.’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020, on December 18, 2020, Lifted as tenant entered into a Lease Agreement (the “Lease) with 95th Holdings, LLC (“Landlord”) for office, laboratory and warehouse space in a building located at 5511 95th Avenue, in the City of Kenosha, State of Wisconsin (the “Premises”).  
 
The purpose of the Lease is to supplement and eventually replace Lifted’s current 3,300 square foot leased manufacturing facility and warehouse located in Zion, Illinois, as well as the space that Lifted has been temporarily using located adjacent to that rented space. Lifted’s current rented space in Zion, Illinois, is not adequate in light of various issues including zoning uncertainties, lack of air conditioning, and small size.
 
Under the terms of the “triple-net” Lease, starting on January 1, 2021, Lifted leased approximately 11,238 square feet at the Premises at $6.13 per square foot per year in base rent ($68,888.94 in 2021), which is subject to a 2% increase in base rent each year, plus certain operating expenses and taxes. The Lease will continue until midnight on the fifth anniversary date of the commencement date of the Lease. Lifted shall have the right to extend the original five year term of the Lease for one extension period of two years, commencing upon the expiration of the original term. Lifted and Landlord are required to execute an “Amendment of Extension” prior to six months before the expiration of the original term.
 
Under the terms of the lease, the tenant, Lifted, has the option to purchase the property at any time prior to December 31, 2025, and in any event, Lifted is obligated to purchase the property on or before that date. Pursuant to the Lease, in all cases Lifted’s purchase price for the Premises shall be in an amount equal to the greater of: (1) the fair market value of the Premises at the time Lifted purchases the Premises; or (2) any remaining principal balance of any purchase-money mortgage for the Premises existing at the time of the closing of Lifted’s purchase, plus the corresponding amount identified in the Additional Purchase Price Schedule attached as Exhibit B to the Lease, which is an additional amount ranging between $300,000 and $375,000 based on the number of years that have passed between the commencement of the Lease and the purchase of the Premises by Lifted.
 
Landlord is an entity owned by Nicholas S. Warrender, the Company’s Vice Chairman and COO, the CEO of Lifted, and the largest stockholder of the Company as beneficial owner of 3,900,455 common stock shares. Due to the potential conflict of interest, the terms and conditions of the Lease were negotiated on behalf of Lifted by Vincent J. Mesolella, the Lead Outside Director of the Company. Landlord and Lifted were represented by their own independent legal counsel in connection with the Lease. Under the terms of the Lease, Mr. Warrender is able to benefit through his entity 95th Holdings, LLC by receiving rent and by eventually selling the Premises to Lifted.
 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Lease Agreement and exhibits which were filed as Exhibit 10.58 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 22, 2020, and which are incorporated herein by reference.

Lifted owns 50% of SmplyLifted LLC (“SmplyLifted”). The other 50% of SmplyLifted is owned by SMPLSTC LLC and its principals, who are located in Costa Mesa, California. SmplyLifted conducts its business at Lifted’s and SMPLSTC LLC’s offices, currently without any rent or other charges being payable by SmplyLifted.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Lifted sources certain raw goods and products from independent suppliers. Lifted’s hemp and hemp-derived raw materials are third-party lab tested. Lifted also sources gel and liquid sanitizer from various third parties. 
 
Lifted acquires its disposable vape pens and cartridges from third party manufacturers and, in its clean room, adds Lifted’s proprietary vape solutions into the disposable vape pens and vape cartridges. 
 
Lifted also acquires a variety of vape pens and cartridges, bottles, containers, boxes, labels, packaging and other items from third party manufacturers. 
 
Lifted currently believes that it would be able to find replacement manufacturers with minimal negative impact on its business. However, Lifted's vape pens and cartridges are sourced exclusively from China, and much of Lifted's boxes, packaging and other items are sourced from China. COVID-19, Chinese holidays, and tariffs imposed on products sourced from China could make it difficult or impossible to source these products cost effectively, or at all, from China. COVID-19, Chinese holidays and/or tariffs could make it difficult or impossible for Lifted to manufacture needed quantities of its products, if at all, and could drastically increase Lifted's product costs, all of which could have a serious detrimental impact on Lifted’s sales and profit margins. 
 
SmplyLifted sources its inventory, packaging and marketing materials from independent suppliers.
 
Products
 
Lifted’s focus is manufacturing, sales and distribution of effective, quality products formulated in a clean room. In the past, Lifted has re-bottled and re-sold gel and liquid hand sanitizer. Such re-sales of hand sanitizer are unlikely to continue in the future. Lifted sources hemp-derived cannabinoids and other ingredients and products from many different suppliers. The ingredients are then incorporated into proprietary formulations in house. 
 
Lifted produces its own lines of hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products, as well as numerous hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products for private label clients. Lifted’s current list of products include: hemp flower; CBG delta-8-THC flower, hemp-derived delta-8-THC infused vape cartridges, a disposable delta-8-THC vape, saucy dmnds, gummies, chocolate, dabs and caviar cones; hemp-derived nano CBD water enhancer packets; hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused lotions, sexual lubricant, tinctures, bath bombs, oral sprays, bug spray, muscle gel, moon rocks, gummies, caviar cones, vape pens, vape cartridges, dog food and other edibles, and non-prescription cannabinoid formulations; and hemp cigarettes and joints. 
 
A third party manufacture makes cannabinoid-infused lotion for Lifted in accordance with Lifted's specifications. Lifted also produces its cannabinoid-infused gummy products and bath bombs through third party manufacturers.
 
Lifted also distributes disposable e-cigarettes containing nicotine.
 
Lifted owns 50% of SmplyLifted LLC, which sells tobacco-free nicotine pouches under the brand name FR3SH (www.GETFR3SH.com).
 
Product Risks
 
Some of Lifted's and SmplyLifted’s products currently contain nicotine, delta-8-THC, CBD and other cannabinoids. There is a risk that Lifted could be targeted by regulators or consumers with claims that its products are unsafe.
 
The market for cannabinoid-infused vapes and cartridges is currently subjected to prohibitions of certain products in certain jurisdictions in response to deaths and illnesses that have occurred and that are apparently associated with vaping. In addition, certain jurisdictions have prohibited the sale of smokable hemp and hemp-derived products, and delta-8-THC. These various prohibitions and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Lifted's financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Lifted maintains proprietary formulations and other trade secrets. However, Lifted owns no registered patents and has no patent applications pending.

8

R&D expenditures
 
Lifted's research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products. Lifted spent less than $10,000 on research and development efforts over the past two years. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. 
Marketing 
 
Lifted markets itself by networking throughout the industry through word of mouth and its website. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lifted also occasionally attended trade shows. During 2020, Lifted has also begun public relations and search engine optimization efforts. There can be no guarantee or assurance that these efforts will be successful or result in any additional sales or profits for Lifted.
 
SmplyLifted markets itself by networking throughout the industry through word of mouth and its website.
 
Distribution
 
Lifted’s and SmplyLifted’s distribution is done internally and through third party distributors who distribute throughout the U.S. Lifted, SmplyLifted and these distributors distribute Lifted’s and SmplyLifted’s products to vape and smoke shops, convenience stores, grocery stores, gyms, natural food stores, wellness stores, and other locations. Lifted and SmplyLifted believe but cannot guarantee that in the event that it lost its relationship with one or more of its current distributors, that other replacement distributors could be found without significant disruption to Lifted’s and SmplyLifted’s business. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted Lifted’s distribution channels, although such disruption has begun to decrease. Lifted has entered into a distribution agreement with Girish GPO for the distribution of CBD and delta-8-THC products to potentially thousands of independent pharmacies nationwide.
Online Sales of Lifted Made Products
 
Lifted sells its own brands of products and its private label clients’ products online primarily through www.LiftedMade.com.
 
Commissions on Sales
 
Lifted has agreed to pay 7% commissions on certain sales to certain individuals, some of whom are affiliated with the Company and some of whom are relatives of affiliates of the company.
 
Creation of SmplyLifted LLC
 
As described in the press release issued on October 19, 2020, Acquired Sales Corp. and Lifted Made and privately-held SMPLSTC, Costa Mesa, CA (www.SMPLSTCBD.com) have partnered to create an equally-owned new entity called SmplyLifted LLC, which has begun selling non-tobacco nicotine pouches in four flavors and four and six mg. nicotine strengths under the brand name FR3SH (www.GETFR3SH.com). The nicotine pouches are sold in plastic canisters containing 20 pouches. The canisters are competitively priced, and are expected to be sold globally by retailers and direct to consumers online. Lifted Made, SMPLSTC, and three individuals have a 50%, 20%, 10%, 10%, and 10% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC, respectively.
 
Online Sales of SmplyLifted LLC Products
 
Currently, SmplyLifted LLC sells its brand of nicotine pouches, FR3SH, to wholesalers and distributors. Soon, SmplyLifted LLC plans to sell its nicotine pouches direct-to-consumer online through www.GETFR3SH.com.
 
Description of Legal Proceedings 
 
Lifted currently is involved in one pending lawsuit, as the defendant:

Martha, Edgar v. Lifted Liquids – Edgar Martha, who worked as an independent contractor in Lifted’s production facility, has sued Lifted in regard to an alleged chemical burn. Mr. Martha has expressed to Lifted’s attorney that Mr. Martha is inclined to settle the case for $5,000. However, there can be no assurance or guarantee that the case can be settled for $5,000, as the medical bills in the case are significant and Mr. Martha’s medical insurance carrier has refused coverage. 
 
During 2020, Lifted entered into settlement agreements that were mutually acceptable to the parties which have resolved the following four lawsuits:

The Lifted Made Merger
 
The terms of the Lifted Merger were as follows:
 
·
The Company acquired 100% of the ownership of Lifted for $3,750,000 in cash, plus note consideration (the "Promissory Note") of $3,750,000, plus 3,900,455 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company (the "Stock Consideration"), plus 645,000 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company that will constitute deferred contingent compensation to be issued and delivered to certain persons specified by Nicholas S. Warrender in a schedule delivered by Nicholas S. Warrender to the Company at the closing of the Merger (the "Deferred Contingent Stock"), plus warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,820,000 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $5.00 per share that will be issued and delivered to certain persons specified by Nicholas S. Warrender in a schedule delivered by Nicholas S. Warrender to the Corporation at the closing of the Merger (the "Warrants"). 
 
·
The Promissory Note, payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to Nicholas S. Warrender, is in the principal amount of $3,750,000. The Promissory Note is secured by all of the assets of the Company and Lifted, and by a pledge of all of the common stock of Lifted, Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits that are owned by the Company. The Promissory Note accrues interest at the rate of 2% annually, and has a term of five years, subject to mandatory partial prepayment using 50% of all capital raised by the Company other than capital raised in connection with two potential acquisitions in Wisconsin, and subject to mandatory full prepayment if and when Lifted achieves an aggregate post-Closing EBITDA of $7,500,000. Lifted will not be using any of the loan or grant money that Lifted has received from the SBA to make any payments on the Promissory Note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to Nicholas S. Warrender. 
 
·
The purpose of the 645,000 shares of unregistered common stock of Acquired Sales that constitutes the Deferred Contingent Stock is to incentivize certain persons whom Nicholas S. Warrender considers necessary to allow Lifted and the Company to succeed going forward. Among other persons, Nicholas S. Warrender designated as recipients of shares of the Deferred Contingent Stock certain employees of Lifted and William C. "Jake" Jacobs, the Company's President and CFO. The vesting of certain shares of the Deferred Contingent Stock is subject to certain terms and conditions, and if any of such terms and conditions are not met then any unvested Deferred Contingent Stock will be issued and delivered to Nicholas S. Warrender as additional Merger consideration, unless Nicholas S. Warrender agrees to an alternative allocation of such unvested Deferred Contingent Stock. 
 
·
The purpose of the Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,820,000 shares of unregistered common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $5.00 per share is to incentivize certain persons whom Nicholas S. Warrender considers necessary to allow Lifted and the Company to succeed going forward. Among other persons, Nicholas S. Warrender designated as recipients of Warrants certain employees, officers and directors of Lifted and the Company. The vesting of certain of the Warrants will be subject to certain terms and conditions, and if any of such terms and conditions are not met then any unvested Warrants will be terminated or alternatively allocated to other employees of Lifted. 
 
·
Nicholas S. Warrender was granted certain registration rights for the 3,900,455 shares of the Company’s unregistered common stock that he received in the Merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Registration Rights Agreement. 
 
·
Nicholas S. Warrender, the Company's President and CFO William C. “Jake” Jacobs, and the Company's Chairman and CEO Gerard M. Jacobs, who together as a group have stockholder and managerial control of the Company, entered into a Stockholders Agreement to vote in concert regarding the election of directors of the Company and on certain other matters. 
 
·
The Company has entered into a long-term employment agreements with Nicholas S. Warrender, William C. "Jake" Jacobs, and Gerard M. Jacobs, pursuant to which each of them is entitled to $100,000 in base salary and an annual bonus stemming from the Company’s cash management bonus pool. 
 
·
The effects of the Merger are that all assets, property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses, and authority of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly d/b/a Lifted Liquids) and Lifted have vested in Lifted 

10

as the surviving entity in the Merger, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly d/b/a Lifted Liquids) have become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, and duties of Lifted as the surviving entity in the Merger. Lifted is operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
·
The articles of incorporation of Lifted are the articles of incorporation of the surviving entity in the Merger, and the by-laws of Lifted are the by-laws of the surviving entity of the Merger. 
 
·
Upon the Closing of the Merger, the authorized number of directors of the Corporation was increased from seven to nine. The Corporation’s directors currently consist of eight persons following the election of a new board of directors and the subsequent resignation of Michael D. McCaffrey: Gerard M. Jacobs, JD (Chairman), Nicholas S. Warrender (Vice Chairman), Vincent J. Mesolella (Lead Outside Director), Joshua A. Bloom, MD, James S. Jacobs, MD, Richard E. Morrissy, Kevin J. Rocio, and Robert T. Warrender II. 
 
·
Upon the Closing of the Merger, the officers of the Corporation are as follows, each to hold office until his successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with applicable Law: Gerard M. Jacobs, JD - Chairman, CEO and Secretary; William C. "Jake" Jacobs, CPA - President, CFO and Treasurer; and Nicholas S. Warrender - Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. 
 
Source of Funds for the Lifted Merger

The source of funds for the $3,750,000 cash component of the acquisition of Lifted was proceeds from previous sales of Acquired Sales Corp.’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (convertible at $1 per share of common stock of the Company) and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (convertible at $5 per share of common stock of the Company). We anticipate that the source of funds to repay the $3,750,000 Promissory Note component of the acquisition of Lifted will be proceeds from future sales of Acquired Sales Corp.’s equity securities, and revenue from Lifted's business. Professional costs in connection with the Merger were paid using cash on hand that was sourced from previous sales of Acquired Sales Corp.’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 
Post-Merger Shareholder Rights and Accounting Treatment of the Merger
 
There are no material differences in the rights of the Company’s shareholders as a result of the Merger, as the nature of the shares of common stock of the Company has not changed due to the Merger. However, there has been stockholder dilution with additional shares and warrants outstanding.
 
As of the date of acquisition (February 24, 2020), the Merger was considered a business combination. The accounting treatment of the Merger is that the Company is deemed to be the accounting acquirer of Lifted, and Lifted is deemed to be the accounting acquiree, under the acquisition method of accounting. 
 
The Application of Accounting Guidance to the Merger
 
Quoted below are the accounting standards codification guidance relating to the accounting treatment of the Company’s acquisition of Lifted as of the date of Merger, followed by the Company’s comments regarding the application of that guidance to the Merger:
Guidance: “Other pertinent facts and circumstances also shall be considered in identifying the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity interests, including the following:
 
1. a. 
The relative voting rights in the combined entity after the business combination. The acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined entity. In determining which group of owners retains or receives the largest portion of the voting rights, an entity shall consider the existence of any unusual or special voting arrangements and options, warrants, or convertible securities.”
The Company’s Comments: In evaluating which entity whose owners as a group retain or receive the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined entity, the Company observes that: (1) the voting rights held by the Company’s outstanding common stock, options and warrants, and convertible securities represented a total of 13,684,538 shares on a fully diluted basis; and (2) the voting rights held by the Company’s outstanding common stock, options and warrants, convertible securities, 3,900,455 shares of common stock issued to Nicholas S. Warrender, 645,000 shares of deferred contingent common stock issued in the merger, and the 1,820,000 warrants granted in the merger, represented a total of 20,049,993 shares on a fully diluted basis. Consequently, the existing shareholders of the Company owned 68% of the merged entity on a fully diluted basis. Note: many of the 645,000 shares of deferred contingent stock and many of the 1,820,000 warrants granted in the transaction were issued to current officers and directors of the Company, and, pursuant to the Compensation Agreement dated June 19, 2019, as a result of the Company’s closing of the acquisition of Lifted, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs were awarded warrants to purchase 250,000 and 225,000 shares of common stock of the Company at $5.00 per share, respectively, so the existing shareholders of the Company actually owned more than 68% of the combined entity on a fully diluted basis. 

11

The foregoing analysis of the relative voting rights of the combined entity suggests that the Company should be considered to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger. 
 
Guidance: “2. b. 
The existence of a large minority voting interest in the combined entity if no other owner or organized group of owners has a significant voting interest. The acquirer usually is the combining entity whose single owner or organized group of owners holds the largest minority voting interest in the combined entity.”
The Company’s Comments: The stockholders agreement entered into between Nicholas S. Warrender, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs effectively prevents Nicholas S. Warrender from exercising any control over the combined entity that is not approved by the Company’s current management team of Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs. This effect of the stockholders agreement suggests that the Company should be considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger.
Guidance: “3. c. 
The composition of the governing body of the combined entity. The acquirer usually is the combining entity whose owners have the ability to elect or appoint or to remove a majority of the members of the governing body of the combined entity.”
The Company’s Comments: The pre-closing directors of the Company had seven seats on the Board of Directors of the combined entity, and Nicholas S. Warrender and his nominee Kevin J. Rocio received only two seats. In addition, the stockholders agreement between Nicholas S. Warrender, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs effectively prevents Nicholas S. Warrender from taking control over the Board of Directors of the combined entity post-closing. The foregoing analysis suggests that the Company should be considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger. 
Guidance: “4. d. 
The composition of the senior management of the combined entity. The acquirer usually is the combining entity whose former management dominates the management of the combined entity.”
The Company’s Comments: The pre-closing officers of the Company continue to serve as the Company’s Chairman, CEO, President, CFO, Treasurer and Secretary. The only additional officer role is that of Nicholas S. Warrender, who now serves as the Company’s Vice Chairman and COO. The foregoing analysis suggests that the Company should be considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger. 
Guidance: “5. e. 
The terms of the exchange of equity interests. The acquirer usually is the combining entity that pays a premium over the precombination 
fair value of the equity interests of the other combining entity or entities.”
 
The Company’s Comments: It is very difficult to say with any certainty whether or not the Company paid a premium over the precombination fair value of Lifted. Most of the companies in the cannabis industry are losing money and nevertheless are enjoying market capitalizations that are massively higher than the consideration that the Company paid to acquire Lifted. However, Lifted has historically been involved in the vaping and e-liquids industry, and it is unclear what discount to fair value should be attributed to that involvement. The foregoing analysis does not assist us in reaching any conclusion as to which entity should be considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger.
Guidance: “55-13 
The acquirer usually is the combining entity whose relative size (measured in, for example, assets, revenues, or earnings) is significantly larger than that of the other combining entity or entities.”
The Company’s Comments: In terms of assets, prior to the closing, the Company’s cash on hand of over $4 million significantly exceeded Lifted’s assets. On the other hand, Lifted’s revenues and earnings significantly exceed the Company’s revenue and earnings. This analysis does not assist us in reaching any conclusion as to which entity should be considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger.
Guidance: “55-14 
In a business combination involving more than two entities, determining the acquirer shall include a consideration of, among other things, which of the combining entities initiated the combination, as well as the relative size of the combining entities, as discussed in the preceding paragraph.”
The Company’s Comments: This consideration is not applicable as the Merger of the Company and Lifted did not involve more than two entities.
 
Guidance: “55-15 
A new entity formed to effect a business combination is not necessarily the acquirer. If a new entity is formed to issue equity interests to effect a business combination, one of the combining entities that existed before the business combination shall be identified as the acquirer by applying the guidance in paragraphs 
805-10-55-10 through 55-14. In contrast, a new entity that transfers cash or other assets or incurs liabilities as consideration may be the acquirer.”
 
The Company’s Comments: This consideration is not applicable as the Company and Lifted are not structuring a business combination.

Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing analysis of the facts surrounding the Company’s acquisition of Lifted, it is the Company’s position that the Company is the accounting acquirer of Lifted in the Merger, and Lifted is the accounting acquiree in the Merger, under the acquisition method of accounting. 
 
As such, as of February 24, 2020 (the acquisition date), the Company recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the Merger. 
 
The federal income tax consequences of the Merger are as follows: the transaction is expected to be booked as a tax-free exchange of stock pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 368, resulting in no federal income tax consequences of the stock portion of the transaction.

Determination of the Fair Value of the Shares of Common Stock and Warrants Issued as Part of the Merger Consideration 
 
The Company determined the fair value of the shares of common stock issued on February 24, 2020 as part of the Merger Consideration by multiplying the stock closing price on January 7, 2020 ($2.75) by the number of common stock shares issued (3,900,455) in the Merger. January 7, 2020 was the date of entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger.
 
The Company determined the fair value of the warrants issued on February 24, 2020 as part of the Merger Consideration by using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which incorporated the following assumptions: expected future stock volatility 362%; risk-free interest rate of 1.55%; dividend yield of 0% and an expected term of 2.57 years. The expected future stock volatility was based on the historical volatility of Acquired Sales Corp.’s common stock price per share. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Federal treasury rate for instruments due over the expected term of the warrants. The expected term of each warrant was based on the midpoint between the date the warrant vested and the contractual term of the warrant. The values of the warrants were considered part of the Merger consideration.
 
Allocation of Purchase Price to Goodwill

13

The Company’s primary motivation for acquiring Lifted was to secure the exclusive services of Nicholas S. Warrender. Mr. Warrender founded Lifted in 2014 with $900, and since its inception has done a masterful job staying ahead of industry trends, navigating industry challenges and launching innovative, advanced branded products before competitors launched their branded products. Mr. Warrender is focused and relentless, and attracts many people who like his energy and creativeness and want to do business with him. In the Company’s opinion, Lifted’s customers do business with Lifted primarily because of Mr. Warrender; and, at the time of the Merger, Mr. Warrender was the only full time employee handling sales for Lifted. There were no other material identifiable intangible assets that were considered appropriate for recognition at the time of close. In a very significant sense, Lifted is Mr. Warrender, and Mr. Warrender is Lifted. This is why the Company recognized $22,292,767 of the total acquisition consideration paid in the Merger as being goodwill.
 
OLCC Review of New Directors of the Company 
 
To our knowledge, our directors Nicholas S. Warrender, Kevin J. Rocio and Robert T. Warrender II still need to be formally approved by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission ("OLCC"), in light of the Company's ownership of common stock of distilled spirits manufacturers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, Bend, Oregon. The Company has submitted to the OLCC Personal History Forms for Nicholas S. Warrender, Kevin J. Rocio and Robert T. Warrender II, and to the Company’s knowledge, none of Nicholas S. Warrender, Kevin J. Rocio nor Robert T. Warrender II has any personal history that would disqualify him from serving as a director of the Company. 
 
The Company would plan to consult with Oregon legal counsel in the event that the OLCC were to object to Nicholas S. Warrender, Kevin J. Rocio or Robert T. Warrender II serving as a director of the Company, a situation that the Company presently has no grounds to expect to occur. While no guarantee or assurance can be given as to the ultimate consequences in the event that the OLCC were to object to Nicholas S. Warrender, Kevin J. Rocio or Robert T. Warrender II serving as a director of the Company, the management of the Company believes that the worst case scenario in the event that the OLCC were to object to Kevin J. Rocio or Robert T. Warrender II serving as a director of the Company would involve Kevin J. Rocio or Robert T. Warrender II, as the case may be, being removed from the Board of Directors of the Company, and that the worst case scenario in the event that the OLCC were to object to Nicholas S. Warrender serving as a director of the Company would involve the Company being forced to sell the shares of common stock that the Company owns in Bendistillery Inc. and Bend Spirits, Inc., even if such a sale is at a loss.
 
Description of Certain Key Provisions of the Transaction Documents Relating to the Lifted Merger Agreement
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company signed a Registration Rights Agreement granting Nicholas S. Warrender, or his assigns, “piggyback” and “demand” registration rights in regard to any and all Company registration statements filed with the SEC on or prior to a termination date set out in the agreement, in order to permit the registration of all 3,900,455 shares of Common Stock issued to Mr. Warrender as Stock Consideration in the Merger ("Registrable Shares"). The Registration Rights Agreement can be summarized as follows:
 
Subject to certain limitations, Mr. Warrender, or his assigns, may demand registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Shares at any time beginning on the 120th day following the closing of the Merger Agreement. The Company must then file a registration statement within ten days. The Company may postpone for up to 180 days the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration if the board of directors determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that such demand registration would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate organization, financing, securities offering or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. The Company may delay a demand registration hereunder only once in any period of 12 consecutive months. 
 
No demand registration shall be required where in the judgment of the Company, its legal counsel, and/or SEC guidance and comments the registration would be deemed a primary offering pursuant to Securities Act Rule 415, which is interpreted by the SEC staff to prohibit registrations of stock for resale where the seller is deemed to be engaged in a primary offering of behalf of the issuer. The registration rights agreement shall terminate when no Registrable Shares remain outstanding.
 
Secured Promissory Note
 
At the closing of the Merger, the Company executed a secured promissory note of $3,750,000 payable to Nicholas S. Warrender (the “Promissory Note”) which can be summarized as follows:
 
Interest on the Promissory Note shall be 2% per year. The maturity date of the Promissory Note is the earlier of (a) the date which is 30 days after the last day of the calendar quarter during which Lifted's aggregate EBITDA (aggregate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ) since the Closing Date of the Merger exceeds $7.5 million, or (b) the date which is the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger.

14

The Promissory Note shall have mandatory prepayments, subject to certain limitations, within five business days following the closing of any equity or debt capital raise by the Company or Lifted following the date of the Merger Agreement wherein Mr. Warrender is entitled to be paid at least 50% of the net proceeds of such capital raise toward a prepayment of the principal and accrued interest on the Promissory Note, excluding only the capital raise for the potential Wisconsin Acquisitions referred to in Section 5.23(a) of the Merger Agreement. See “Obligation to Pursue Two Opportunities” below. Lifted did not use any of the loan or grant money that Lifted has received from the SBA to make any payments on the Promissory Note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to Nicholas S. Warrender. 
 
The Promissory Note is secured by (a) a first lien security interest in all of the assets of the Company and Lifted; and (b) a pledge of: (i) all of the capital stock of Lifted; (ii) all of the common stock of Bendistillery, Bend Spirits and Ablis that is owned by the Company; and (iii) all of the capital stock of any other entity owned by the Company, Lifted or any of their subsidiaries, pursuant to a Collateral Stock Pledge Agreement between Mr. Warrender, as Secured Party, and the Company and Lifted, as Pledgors. 
 
Stockholders Agreement
 
At the closing of the Merger Agreement, our COO Nicholas S. Warrender, our CEO Gerard M. Jacobs, and our President and CFO William C. "Jake" Jacobs entered into a Stockholders Agreement which can be summarized as follows: each of them will vote all shares of our common stock now or hereafter owned or controlled by him as unanimously agreed upon by all three of them, including as to the following matters: election, removal and filling vacancies on our board of directors; our charter and bylaws; employment agreements, consulting agreements, fee agreements, base salaries, bonuses, management bonus pools amounts and calculations, management bonus pool allocations and payments, future stock options or warrants issuances, and any other direct or indirect compensation or benefits of any nature whatsoever; acquisitions; divestitures; and capital raises. 
Executive Employment Agreements
 
At the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into employment agreements with Nicholas S. Warrender to serve as Co-Founder, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and as Chief Executive Officer of Lifted, with Gerard M. Jacobs, J.D., to serve as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company, and with William C. "Jake" Jacobs, CPA to serve as President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company (collectively the “Executive Employment Agreements”), which can be summarized as follows:
 
Each of the Executive Employment Agreements is a "rolling" five year employment agreement wherein the executive's employment is effective and shall continue until the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Executive Employment Agreement, unless terminated. Each of the Executive Employment Agreements shall be deemed to be automatically extended, upon the same terms and conditions, for additional periods of one year (extending the term of such Executive Employment Agreement to five years after each such extension date), unless either party provides written notice of such party’s intention not to extend the term of such Executive Employment Agreement at least 90 days’ prior to the applicable extension date.
 
During the employment term, each executive shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention to the performance of his duties under his Executive Employment Agreement and shall not engage in any other business, profession or occupation for compensation or otherwise which would conflict or interfere with the performance of such services either directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company; provided, that such executive shall be permitted to continue to participate as an officer of any corporation that owns real estate as of the date of his Executive Employment Agreement with the Company and that is owned by a family trust of which such executive is a grantor or beneficiary, and provided further that such executive, with the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to act as a director, trustee, committee member or principal of any type of business, civic or charitable organization and to purchase or own less than 5% of the publicly traded securities of any corporation provided, however, that such ownership represents a passive investment and that such executive is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, such corporation, and that such activities do not interfere with the performance of such executive's duties and responsibilities to the Company.
 
The annual rate of each executive's base salary under his Executive Employment Agreement is $100,000.
 
Each executive shall participate in the Company’s annual company-wide management bonus pool, which can be generally described as a cash set-aside for management bonuses of an amount equal to 33% of the amount (if any) by which the Company's actual annual consolidated EBITDA exceeds an annual consolidated EBITDA target amount that is mutually agreed upon between the Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the board of directors, on the one hand, and Nicholas S. Warrender, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. "Jake" Jacobs, on the other hand, with the allocation of such management bonus pool to be determined by unanimous written agreement of such three executives.

15

The Company will provide to each executive an employee benefits package including fully paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield or equivalent family health, vision and dental insurance. The Company will also provide to each executive prompt reimbursement for all documented business related expenses paid or incurred by such executive in connection with Acquired Sales, including but not limited to airfare, rail, taxi, rental cars, parking, tolls, gasoline for business trips, meals, entertainment, hotel, office supplies, mobile phone, internet, hotspot, and postage expenses.
 
Each executive's employment may be terminated by either the Company or such executive at any time and for any reason, provided that any termination of such executive's employment by the Company without cause will trigger significant payment obligations by the Company to such executive. 
 
Impact of the Merger on Gerard M. Jacobs' and William C. "Jake" Jacobs' Compensation Agreement
 
The Company entered into a Compensation Agreement dated as of June 19, 2019, with our CEO Gerard M. Jacobs and our President and CFO William C. "Jake" Jacobs. The material terms of the Compensation Agreement, as amended on December 1, 2020, can be summarized as follows:

"Jake" Jacobs as described in the section above entitled "Executive Employment Agreements";
 
(2) The closing of the Lifted Merger triggered obligations of the Company to pay cash bonuses to the Company's CEO Gerard M. Jacobs and the to the Company's President and CFO William C.

"Jake" Jacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, plus 2% annual interest accruing on and after January 1, 2021; 
 
(4) Upon the earlier of December 1, 2021, or the first date when we have raised a total of at least $25 million after January 1, 2019, we will pay Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. "Jake" Jacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively;
 
(5) The terms of Gerard M. Jacobs' stock options granted by us to purchase shares of common stock of AQSP which were set to expire (unless previously exercised) during November 2020 or during September 2021, respectively, have been extended so that all of such stock options may be exercised by Gerard M. Jacobs at any time on or before December 31, 2024;

(7) We issued to Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. "Jake" Jacobs five-year warrants containing a "cashless exercise" feature giving Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. "Jake" Jacobs (or his designee(s)) the right to purchase 250,000 and 225,000 shares, respectively, of common stock of Acquired Sales exercisable at $5.00 per share. 
 
Obligation to Pursue Two Acquisitions in Wisconsin
 
The Merger Agreement imposes a legally binding obligation upon us to use good faith efforts to acquire two companies located in Wisconsin. These two companies are completely unrelated to, and are not affiliated in any way with, Nicholas S. Warrender. Since the Merger Agreement was entered into, we and Nicholas S. Warrender have mutually agreed to abandon all efforts to acquire the two companies located in Wisconsin, and no further time, efforts, or expense are being incurred in relation to these two companies located in Wisconsin. 
Obligation to Pursue a Hemp Processing System Deal
 
The Merger Agreement imposes a legally binding obligation upon us to use good faith efforts to pursue an opportunity in the cannabinoid industry. Nicholas S. Warrender's father, Board member Robert T. Warrender II, has introduced us to a potential business opportunity to process CBD from hemp using a system that is currently undergoing proof of concept operational testing and that incorporates particular filtration and pump equipment and technology identified by Robert T. Warrender II. Robert T. Warrender II believes that this advanced hemp processing system has the potential to allow significantly higher throughput, and lower per unit costs of production. We have agreed to analyze the results of the proof of concept's construction, operating costs, and operating results. If such analysis is favorable and is approved by our Board in its discretion, then we will use good faith efforts to attempt to proceed forward, in a joint venture or other arrangement involving Robert T. Warrender II, with a project(s) consisting 

16

of one or more of such hemp processing systems, subject to various conditions including a capital raise associated therewith, and any equity compensation received by Robert T. Warrender II from the financing, construction, operation, leasing and/or sale of such project(s) shall be structured in the form of shares of common stock of Acquired Sales valued at the then-current trading price per share of common stock of Acquired Sales but in no event at higher than $5.00 per share of common stock of Acquired Sales.
 
Since the Company’s acquisition of Lifted Made in February 2020, there have been no material discussions among the Company, Lifted Made, and Robert T. Warrender II regarding the development or financing of any hemp processing system and to date no such project has proceeded forward. If the project proceeds, and there is no assurance that it will proceed, a company owned by Robert T. Warrender II could potentially supply certain pumps and other equipment for that project. 
 
Post-Merger Business
 
Our cash on hand is expected to be sufficient to allow us to pay the post-closing salaries of Gerard M. Jacobs, our CEO, and of William C. "Jake" Jacobs, our President and CFO during 2021, the fees and expenses of our securities lawyer and auditors during 2021, and certain other operational expenses. 
 
However, beyond those payments, our available capital is limited. We have not yet paid an aggregate of $350,000 of bonuses owed to Gerard M. Jacobs, our CEO, and to William C. "Jake" Jacobs, our President and CFO, because we currently do not have the funds to do so. These bonuses are payable upon demand. Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs are entitled to an additional aggregate of $350,000 of bonuses that are payable to them upon demand on or after January 1, 2021. And we do not have available capital to fund further acquisitions.
 
Nevertheless, we still intend to continue post-closing our strategy of acquiring Canna-Infused Products Companies. In order to continue our acquisition strategy, we will need to raise a significant amount of additional capital to pay the cash portion of the consideration paid in our acquisitions, and to inject growth capital into the acquired companies. We anticipate that additional capital will need to be raised in some combination of the following: (1) Private placements of shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock convertible at $5 per share; (2) Private placements of shares of newly declared series of convertible preferred stock convertible at to-be-negotiated price(s) per share, which may be significantly less than the current trading price per share of our common stock, depending upon the financial performance of Lifted, market conditions, and cannabinoid industry conditions; (3) Private placements of newly issued shares of our common stock, at to-be-negotiated price(s) per share, which may be significantly less than the current trading price per share of our common stock, depending upon the financial performance of Lifted, market conditions, and cannabinoid industry conditions; (4) Borrowings from banks or other third parties, which may not be available, or which may be expensive if available at all; (5) Structuring potential acquisitions either as all stock deals, or as a combination of stock plus notes; (6) Using cash flow generated by Lifted's business to pay the cash portion of merger consideration; and/or (7) Merging into Acquired Sales an entity or entities that have cash on hand or cash flow that would allow other acquisitions to be completed. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Currently, the Company’s only wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifted Made, is generating enough free cash flow to allow the Company and Lifted Made to fund their operations at their current levels and to grow Lifted Made’s business in a conservative, capital-constrained fashion. However, no guarantee or assurance can be given that Lifted Made’s current level of free cash flow will continue in the future, especially in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and executive orders that are associated with the pandemic or that otherwise impact hemp-derived products and nicotine products.
 
The Company and Lifted Made have aspirations to grow significantly faster than at their current levels, both organically and via acquisitions. But, to do so would require the Company to raise many millions of dollars of additional capital.
 
The $3,750,000 note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted Made to Nicholas S. Warrender (the “Note”) is secured by a perfected first lien security interest (the “Security Interest”) that encumbers all of the assets of the Company and Lifted Made. 
 
The existence of the Note and the Security Interest make it extremely difficult for the Company and Lifted Made to raise capital via borrowing, since few if any potential lenders are interested in making loans to the Company and/or to Lifted Made that would be unsecured or that would be secured by a second lien that is subordinate to the Note and the Security Interest, except perhaps on terms that would be extremely expensive or otherwise unattractive to the Company.
 
And currently, management of the Company is reluctant to raise capital by selling equity securities of the Company (common stock and/or convertible preferred stock) at or below the current trading price of the Company’s common stock.
 
Even if the Company is able to raise additional capital via borrowing or the sale of equity securities of the Company: (1) the Company is contractually obligated to allocate and apply 50% of all such additional capital toward a partial or full repayment of the Note; and (2) the Company is currently obligated to pay a total of $350,000 in management bonuses to Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs, and there will also be a total of an additional $350,000 in management bonuses payable to Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs upon demand by them anytime on or after January 1, 2021. Additional capital raised by the Company that is 

17

used to pay down the Note or that is used to pay accrued management bonuses to Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs is collectively referred to as the “Allocated Capital”.
 
If, notwithstanding these impediments, the Company and/or Lifted Made is able to raise debt or equity capital that is in addition to the Allocated Capital (the “Growth Capital”), then the Growth Capital would likely be used first to assist Lifted Made’s organic growth. Lifted Made could expend $1,000,000 or more of the Growth Capital to purchase additional raw materials and inventory, and to hire more sales people and production staff.
 
Any additional Growth Capital available would likely be used in connection with potential acquisitions. It is unclear how much additional Growth Capital would be needed to fund future acquisitions. While the Company would prefer to engage in 100% stock-for-stock acquisitions, potential acquisition candidates frequently prefer that a significant portion of the acquisition consideration be in cash. Also, the process of conducting a due diligence investigation and audit of potential acquisition candidates can be very expensive and requires cash. Also, some potential acquisitions may only make sense if the Company is in a position to inject cash into the potential acquisition candidates simultaneously with the closing of the acquisitions, in order to pay off accrued liabilities or to provide needed growth capital.
 
There is no assurance that the Company and Lifted Made will be able obtain the additional Growth Capital needed to accelerate our growth beyond current levels. Our ability to obtain Growth Capital will depend on the level of pandemic-related stress on Lifted Made’s distributors and customers, investor demand, our performance and reputation, the price of the Company’s common stock, and other factors beyond our control. 
 
Our inability to raise additional Growth Capital could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of our growth objectives. 
 
There can be no assurance or guarantee that any additional Growth Capital will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. The lack of availability of additional Growth Capital could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.
 
The Market
 
Delta-8-THC, CBD, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids can be derived from hemp. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, which is more commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”. The 2018 Farm Bill legalizes hemp cultivation and declassifies hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance. The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under federal law, the FDA continues to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In addition, several states have enacted laws and regulations that negatively impact the sale of hemp and hemp-derived products.
 
Lifted’s product sales of hemp-derived products are typically made through distributors, with a limited but growing number of sales online or direct to retail outlets.
 
While Lifted is optimistic regarding the future of its business selling hemp-derived products, the manufacture and sale of Canna-Infused Products involve significant risks that have the potential to bankrupt Lifted and the Company. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Lifted is subject to a variety of laws in the United States and elsewhere. In the United States, despite cannabis having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult recreational use in a number of states, cannabis, other than plants of the same genus that meet the definition of industrial hemp, continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (“CSIEA”). As of December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill, formally known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, has reclassified hemp for commercial use by removing it from its Schedule I Status under the CSA, and Lifted seeks to operate in compliance with the legislation. 
 
Nicotine and Canna-Infused Products Companies are subject to regulation by federal government, state and local governments. The health and safety impacts of nicotine, delta-8-THC, CBD, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids have not yet been established via traditional scientific and/or clinical studies. The FDA appears to believe that CBD may or could have significant adverse health impacts upon human beings, especially in regard to potential liver toxicity or liver damage. 
 
The regulation of nicotine, hemp, hemp oil, hemp-derived cannabinoids, and cannabinoid-infused products is evolving. Lifted may become subject to new rules, regulations, moratoriums, prohibitions, or other restrictions or impediments upon nicotine and Canna-Infused Products Companies imposed by U.S. federal agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the US Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), and/or state and local governments. 

18

The FDA sometimes appears to believe that cannabinoids are drugs, and that the sale of most cannabinoid-infused products without FDA approval is illegal. In deference to the FDA’s position, various states and municipalities have similarly declared that the sale of certain hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products is illegal. 
 
Other hemp-derived cannabinoids, such as delta-8-THC, have generated controversy among legal commentators, regarding their legality. In particular, the DEA has issued a statement that some have interpreted as making hemp-derived delta-8-THC illegal. Lifted sells significant quantities of products containing hemp-derived delta-8-THC, and any legislative and/or regulatory crackdown on delta-8-THC could have a material adverse effect upon our Company’s business and upon the trading price of our common stock.
 
Hemp and hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products which exceed a delta-9-THC concentration of 0.3% are currently illegal. Any failure to keep the delta-9-THC concentration in hemp-derived or cannabinoid-infused products below 0.3% could subject us to action by regulatory authorities and/or to lawsuits by consumers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our Company's business and upon the trading price of our common stock. 
 
In addition, the approval of medical and recreational marijuana by many states has created a situation in which it may be difficult or impossible for regulators and courts to determine whether the THC levels reflected in consumers’ blood tests are the result of legal hemp-derived products or marijuana-infused products. This may result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against the Company.
 
Also, certain hemp-derived products may, over time, gradually increase their delta-9-THC concentration, and this may ultimately cause such products to exceed the 0.3% delta-9-THC concentration level, making such products illegal in certain jurisdictions. If this happens, we could be subject to regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect upon our Company.
 
Lifted is attempting to only conduct business related to manufacturing and commercializing hemp-derived products to the extent permitted in jurisdictions where it may operate.
 
The legislative and regulatory landscape surrounding nicotine-containing products has created risks for Lifted’s business. Laws and regulations have been adopted that can impose significant liabilities upon companies operating in the nicotine industry, especially in regard to sales to minors.
 
Competition 
 
Lifted faces intense competition in the cannabinoid industry and in the nicotine products industry from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar products to Lifted. Some of Lifted's current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases. Given the rapid changes affecting the cannabinoid industry nationally and locally, Lifted may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to keep pace with any changes in local and national markets, especially in light of legal and regulatory changes. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance. 
Receipt of Loans under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and the Paycheck Protection Program 
 
In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) is making small business owners eligible to apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan advance of up to $10,000 under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan program (the “EIDL”). This advance provides economic relief to businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue. This loan advance will not have to be repaid. Lifted applied for and received a $10,000 loan advance under the EIDL (“EIDL Advance”) on April 20, 2020. Lifted recognized a $10,000 gain on the forgiveness of the EIDL Advance on April 21, 2020. 
 
Lifted also applied for and received a loan (the “PPP Loan”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted March 27, 2020. The PPP Loan was issued by BMO Harris Bank (the “Lender”) in the aggregate principal amount of $149,622.50 and evidenced by a promissory note (the “Note”), dated April 14, 2020 issued by Lifted to the Lender. The Note matures on April 14, 2022. The Note bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing on November 14, 2020, following an initial deferral period as specified under the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, Lifted had an accrual of $1,074 for the interest on the PPP Loan. The Note may be prepaid by Lifted at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loan will be available to Lifted to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs and other permitted expenses, in accordance with the PPP. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest of the PPP Loan may be forgiven to the extent that at least 75% of the PPP Loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the SBA under the PPP. Acquired Sales Corp. believes that Lifted has used at least 75% of the PPP Loan amount for designated qualifying expenses and Lifted plans to apply for forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the terms of the PPP. No assurance can be given that Lifted will obtain forgiveness of the PPP Loan in whole or in part.

19

With respect to any portion of the PPP Loan that is not forgiven, the PPP Loan will be subject to customary provisions for a loan of this type, including customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, and breaches of the provisions of the Note.
 
Acceptance of Subscriptions From Accredited Investors to Purchase Newly Issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”)
 
Between February 27, 2019 and May 13, 2019, the Company accepted subscriptions from accredited investors to purchase 66,150 shares of newly issued Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $6,615,000 in cash. These 66,150 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holders into 6,615,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company, or $1.00 per share of common stock of the Company. The Series A Preferred Stock will receive an annual 3% dividend, and will be subject to mandatory conversion, under terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock. On July 6, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC an amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A covering 30% of the common stock shares into which the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted. On December 10, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC a second amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A covering 30% of the common stock shares into which the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted.
Acceptance of Subscriptions From Accredited Investors to Purchase Newly Issued Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”)
 
Between July 24, 2019 and December 5, 2019, the Company accepted subscriptions from accredited investors to purchase 100,000 shares of newly issued Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 in cash. These 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at the option of the holder into 100,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock will receive an annual 3% dividend, and will be subject to mandatory conversion, under terms and conditions set forth in the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock. On July 6, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC an amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A covering 30% of the common stock shares into which the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted. On December 10, 2020, the Company filed with the SEC a second amended Registration Statement on Form S-1/A covering 30% of the common stock shares into which the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted.
Acquisition Process
 
The structure of the Company’s participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational. 
 
The Company is likely to structure future acquisitions as a purchase of 19.99% or less, or 100%, of a target company’s equity ownership interest, or as a so-called tax-free reorganization. However, in particular situations, the Company is willing to consider alternative deal structures including joint ventures. For example, during 2020, the Company’s Lifted Made subsidiary entered into a 50-50 joint venture called SmplyLifted LLC, with the other 50% of SmplyLifted LLC being owned by SMPLSTC LLC and its principals.
 
In deals that are structured as tax-free reorganizations, it is expected that the Company will issue a relatively large number of newly issued shares of the Company, and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders. 
 
The Company’s present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or purchase of stock. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity or the persons who provide the capital to the Company to finance a merger or purchase of stock will gain control of the Company’s voting stock and the Company’s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace the Company’s officers without stockholder vote.
 
Closing such purchases of stock or so-called tax-free reorganizations will likely require the Company to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction consideration. The Company can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that it will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. 
 
An Investment Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently consisting of our CEO Gerard M. Jacobs, JD, our Chief Operating Officer Nicholas S. Warrender, and our President and CFO William C. "Jake" Jacobs, CPA, will review material furnished to it and will vote whether or not the Investment Committee believes a potential acquisition is in the Company’s best interests and the interests of the Company’s shareholders. If the Investment Committee votes unanimously to approve a potential acquisition, then such acquisition will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Company for their review and a vote. The Company does not intend to proceed forward with a potential acquisition without the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee and approval by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors. 
 
The Company intends to source acquisition opportunities through Gerard M. Jacobs, Nicholas S. Warrender, William C. "Jake" Jacobs, and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include professional advisors such as 

20

attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, other members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) the Company’s ownership of shares in Lifted and other Canna-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) the Company’s flexibility with respect to the manner in which the Company may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors. Inasmuch as the Company will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, the Company will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. The Company will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by the Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.
 
In a due diligence investigation, the Company intends to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, the Company intends to cause the Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.
 
There is no guarantee that the Company can obtain or maintain the funding needed for its operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.
 
As of March 27, 2021, the consolidated cash on hand of Acquired Sales Corp., Younite Corp. and Lifted Made was a total of $761,707, including the Federal Financial Assistance. To date, Lifted has also invested cash of $587,500 into a company called SmplyLifted LLC, which SmplyLifted LLC has primarily used to purchase inventory of tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Lifted expects to invest additional cash into SmplyLifted LLC, also to be primarily used to purchase inventory of tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Lifted has a 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC. 
 
In prior years, Acquired Sales Corp.’s payables have been greater than its cash on hand. Historically, Acquired Sales Corp. has had inconsistent income generating ability and is therefore has been reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.
 
Employees
 
Gerard M. Jacobs, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, manages the Company’s operations with the assistance of William C. "Jake" Jacobs, our President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and Nicholas S. Warrender, our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, under the Executive Employment Agreements described above.
 
We expect to continue to use consultants, attorneys, accountants, other professionals and independent contractors as necessary.

Mr. Hines was a member of the Company’s Nominating, Audit and Investment Committees and no longer serves in those roles.
Robert T. Warrender, II, age 68, is the owner and founder of American Process Equipment, Inc. in Zion, IL. In 1993, Mr. Warrender founded American Process Equipment, Inc., which specializes in specialty pumps and related systems. Mr. Warrender has authored industry publications and technical papers for the pump industry and has served as a consultant to companies in related industries. Mr. Warrender attended the University of Wisconsin-Parkside. Mr. Warrender coached junior high school basketball for 20 years. Mr. Warrender is the father of Nicholas S. Warrender who currently serves as the Company’s Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer, and as the CEO of Acquired Sales Corp.’s wholly owned subsidiary Lifted Made.
 
On October 12, 2020, Michael D. McCaffrey, J.D, resigned from the Board of Directors of Acquired Sales Corp. Mr. McCaffrey served as a member of the Nominating, Compensation and Audit Committees of the Board. Mr. McCaffrey confirmed that his resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company.

December 1, 2020 Amendment to Compensation Agreement dated as of June 19, 2019
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and for other reasons, the Company was not in a position to pay Gerard M. Jacobs, CEO, and William C. “Jake” Jacobs, President and CFO, the $250,000 and $100,000 bonuses, that were to be paid to them, respectively, on December 1, 2020, pursuant to the Compensation Agreement dated as of June 19, 2019. In recognition of this reality, the Company, Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs agreed that in lieu of such payments, upon the earlier of the date when Gerard M. Jacobs or William C. “Jake” Jacobs delivers to the Company written demands for payments which may not be sooner than January 1, 2021, or the first date when the Company has raised a total of at least $15 million after January 1, 2019, the Company shall pay Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs cash bonuses in the amounts of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively (the “Delayed December 1, 2020 Cash Bonuses”); provided that (i) commencing on January 1, 2021, the cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000 that were due and payable by the Company to Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs upon the closing of the Company’s acquisition of Lifted, which have not yet been paid and are payable upon demand by Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs, shall accrue interest until paid in full at the rate of 2% per year, and (ii) commencing on January 1, 2021, the Delayed December 1, 2020 Cash Bonuses, which have not yet been paid and are payable upon demand by Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. “Jake” Jacobs on or after January 1, 2021, shall accrue interest until paid in full at the rate of 2% per year.
