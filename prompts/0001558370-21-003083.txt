Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel cancer therapeutics that reactivate mutant p53 tumor suppressor protein. p53 is the protein expressed from the TP53 gene, the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. We believe that mutant p53 is an attractive therapeutic target due to the high incidence of p53 mutations across a range of cancer types and its involvement in key cellular activities such as apoptosis. Cancer patients with mutant p53 face a significantly inferior prognosis even when treated with the current standard of care, and a large unmet need for these patients remains. Our lead product candidate, APR-246, or eprenetapopt, is a small molecule p53 reactivator that is in clinical development for hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. Eprenetapopt has received Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for MDS, Fast Track designation from the FDA for AML, and Orphan Drug designation from the European Commission for MDS, AML and ovarian cancer, and we believe eprenetapopt will be a first-in-class therapy if approved by applicable regulators. 
We are conducting multiple trials in hematologic malignancy indications, including a Phase 3 trial of eprenetapopt with azacitidine for frontline treatment of TP53 mutant MDS and which is supported by recently published data from two Phase 1b/2 investigator-initiated trials in the U.S. and France; a Phase 2 trial of eprenetapopt with azacitidine for the post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) maintenance treatment of TP53 mutant MDS/AML; a Phase 1/2 trial of eprenetapopt with venetoclax ± azacitidine for the treatment of frontline and relapsed/refractory AML; and a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of TP53 mutant chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) with either eprenetapopt with venetoclax and rituximab, or eprenetapopt with ibrutinib. In addition, we are also testing eprenetapopt with anti-PD-1 therapy in solid tumor patients through a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in advanced gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancers. We are also developing an orally-dosed next-generation small molecule p53 reactivator, APR-548, as a potential therapeutic for multiple hematologic and solid tumor indications. We have received authorization from the FDA to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials with APR-548 and anticipate the first patients to be enrolled early in the second quarter of 2021. We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel oncology drugs to support our mission of developing p53-reactivating therapies for cancer patients.
Our lead programs are summarized below. We currently retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.

We believe that targeting p53 and thereby reactivating key intrinsic cellular functions has the potential to significantly impact patients’ lives and treatment strategies for a wide variety of cancers. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that in its normal state functions to sense DNA damage and induce cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, senescence and cellular apoptosis. Mutant p53 is an attractive target because it is widely mutated across hematologic and solid tumors and is associated with an aggressive clinical and molecular phenotype. In preclinical studies and clinical trials, mutations in p53 and the apoptotic pathway have been shown to play a key role in cancer genesis, proliferation and resistance to currently marketed therapeutic agents. Many approved and clinical stage oncology drugs are more effective with a functional p53 pathway. Our approach is to restore normal function to p53, thereby re-enabling a cell’s ability to undergo apoptosis. Accordingly, we believe that by targeting p53, our drug candidates may enhance the ability of other anti-cancer therapies to induce cancer cell death. In addition, we believe that our approach may counteract resistance mechanisms that characterize many of the most aggressive cancers. Although we have observed single agent activity in preclinical testing of eprenetapopt, our current clinical program is focused on combination therapy based on the strong additive or synergistic effects we have observed in combination with multiple conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, DNA hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins and immuno-oncology checkpoint blockade agents.
Our lead product candidate, eprenetapopt, is a small molecule that has demonstrated reactivation of mutant p53 in clinical trials. Promising clinical data support the application of eprenetapopt across a variety of hematologic malignancies and other oncologic indications. Eprenetapopt is a pro-drug that is administered intravenously and forms the active moiety, 2-methylene-quinuclidin-3-one, or MQ, under physiological conditions. Eprenetapopt has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells with mutant p53 in Phase 1/2 trials. We believe the mechanism of action and current adverse event profile of eprenetapopt may provide the basis for its combination with both conventional and novel therapies, such as targeted therapies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immuno-therapy. Eprenetapopt has received

Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for MDS, Fast Track designation from the FDA for AML, and Orphan Drug designation from the European Commission for MDS, AML and ovarian cancer. 
We are conducting, supporting and planning multiple clinical trials of eprenetapopt:

● | Phase 3 MDS Trial—We recently reported primary data cutoff results, including the primary endpoint of complete remission (CR), from a Phase 3 randomized, controlled trial evaluating eprenetapopt with azacitidine as frontline therapy in HMA-naïve TP53 mutant MDS patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint at this data cut demonstrated a 53% higher number of patients achieving a CR in the experimental arm receiving eprenetapopt with azacitidine versus the control arm receiving azacitidine alone but did not reach statistical significance. In the intention-to-treat population of 154 patients, the CR rate in the eprenetapopt with azacitidine arm was 33.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.1 – 44.9%) compared to 22.4% (95% CI: 13.6% - 33.4%) in the azacitidine alone arm (P = 0.13). While analysis of certain secondary endpoints (objective response rate (ORR) and duration of responses) appears to favor the experimental arm at the primary data cut, the differences were not statistically significant. Additional patients in the study who have not achieved a CR remain on study treatment and the data will be analyzed at future pre-specified timepoints as set forth in the statistical analysis plan. The combination of eprenetapopt with azacitidine appeared well-tolerated, with an adverse event profile that was similar to our prior Phase 2 clinical trials in MDS/AML.

● | U.S. Phase 1b/2 MDS/AML Trial—We supported an investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label trial in the United States, sponsored by Dr. David Sallman of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, or Moffitt, evaluating eprenetapopt with azacitidine as frontline therapy in HMA-naïve patients with TP53 mutant MDS or AML. We collaborated with Moffitt on this trial by supplying eprenetapopt, in addition to providing financial support. The trial enrolled 55 patients. The primary endpoint of the trial was CR rate. In the intention-to-treat population reported in Sallman et al, J Clin Oncol, 2021, the ORR was 71% (95% CI: 57 – 82%) and 44% of patients achieved a CR. In the 40 MDS patients the ORR was 73% (95% CI: 56 – 85%) with 50% achieving a CR. In the 11 AML patients the ORR was 64% (95% CI: 31 – 89%) with 36% achieving a CR. In MDS patients the median duration of response was 8.4 months (95% CI: 6.5 – 13.2 months) and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.8 months – not estimable). In AML patients the median duration of response was 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.2 months – not estimable) and the median duration of CR was 7.0 months (95% CI: 3.3 months – not estimable). At a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, the median OS in the intention-to-treat population was 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.1 − 13.4 months), which was similar between the MDS (10.4 months; 95% CI: 7.6 – 13.3 months) and AML (10.8 months; 95% CI: 5.1 – 16.5 months) disease cohorts.

● | French Phase 1b/2 MDS/AML Trial—We are supporting a parallel investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label trial in France, sponsored by Groupe Francophone des Myélodysplasies, or GFM, under lead investigator Prof. Pierre Fenaux, evaluating eprenetapopt with azacitidine as frontline therapy in HMA-naïve patients with TP53 mutant MDS or AML. We are collaborating with GFM on this trial by supplying eprenetapopt, in addition to providing financial support. The trial enrolled 52 patients. The primary endpoint of the trial was CR rate. In the intention-to-treat population reported in Cluzeau et al, J Clin Oncol, 2021, the ORR was 52% with 37% of patients achieving CR. In the 34 MDS patients the ORR was 62% with 47% achieving a CR. In the 18 AML patients the ORR was 33% with 17% achieving a CR. In MDS patients the median duration of response was 10.4 months (95% CI: 2.8 – 16.8 months) and the median duration of CR was 11.4 months (95% CI: 6.5 - 16.8 months). In AML patients the median duration of response was 12.7 months (95% CI: 6.0 – 17.3 months) and the median duration of CR was 14.0 months (95% CI: 11.3 – 17.3 months). At a median follow-up time of 9.7 months, the median OS in the intention-to-treat population was 12.1 months (95% CI: 8.1 – 13.4 months). Median OS was 12.1 months for MDS patients and 10.4 months for AML patients but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.92).

● | Phase 2 MDS/AML Post-Transplant Trial—We have completed enrollment of 33 patients in a single-arm, open-label Phase 2 trial evaluating eprenetapopt with azacitidine as post-transplant maintenance

therapy in TP53 mutant MDS and AML patients who have received allo-HCT. We anticipate initial results for the primary endpoint of relapse-free survival at 12 months in the second quarter of 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 1/2 AML Trial—We are currently enrolling a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of eprenetapopt therapy in TP53 mutant AML patients. The lead-in portion of the trial evaluated the tolerability of eprenetapopt with venetoclax, with or without azacitidine, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 12 patients receiving either regimen. Based on these results, we have expanded the trial to treat 33 additional frontline TP53 mutant AML patients with the combination of eprenetapopt, venetoclax and azacitidine. In 19 frontline AML patients who are evaluable for efficacy with the triplet regimen, we have observed a 63% CR + CRi composite response rate and a 31% CR rate. We anticipate completion of enrollment in the triplet regimen expansion cohort during the second quarter of 2021 and availability of preliminary response rate data from the cohort also in the second quarter of 2021.

● | Phase 1 NHL Trial—We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory TP53 mutant chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) assessing eprenetapopt with venetoclax and rituximab, and eprenetapopt with ibrutinib in order to further assess eprenetapopt in hematological malignancies. The first patient was enrolled in the first quarter of 2021. We are also planning to evaluate the combination of eprenetapopt with venetoclax in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

● | Phase 1/2 Solid Tumor Trial—We are currently enrolling a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in relapsed/refractory gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancers assessing eprenetapopt with anti-PD-1 therapy. The dose-escalation phase of the trial enrolled 6 patients with advanced solid tumors and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Based on these results, we are enrolling expansion cohorts for patients with advanced gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancers and have currently enrolled 8 patients across these expansion arms.

Our second product candidate, APR-548, is a next-generation p53 reactivator with the potential for oral administration. APR-548 is a unique analog of eprenetapopt and therefore a pro-drug of MQ. APR-548 exhibits high oral bioavailability in preclinical testing and is being developed in an oral dosage form. We have planned a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of APR-548 with azacitidine in frontline and relapsed/refractory MDS patients. We anticipate the first patient to be enrolled in the second quarter of 2021.
We have assembled an outstanding team, which includes world-class scientific and clinical oncology leaders, to execute on our mission to create novel p53-reactivating therapies to help patients suffering with cancer. Together with our board of directors, our scientific founders and members of our management team have significant experience in drug discovery and development and finance. Collectively, we believe our team’s strong capabilities position us to build a leading biotech company focused on developing novel cancer therapies to address the significant unmet medical need of patients with p53 mutant malignancies, for whom there are limited effective therapeutic options.
Our strategy
Our mission is to be the leading player in the development and commercialization of p53-targeted cancer therapies. The key elements of our strategy are to:

● | Complete the ongoing analysis of our Phase 3 trial in TP53 mutant MDS. We are in the process of completing our ongoing analysis of our Phase 3 data set including subgroup analysis, molecular analysis, and dose modifications to advise future trials in MDS as well as our existing development pipeline in hematologic malignancies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapidly develop our lead mutant p53 reactivator, eprenetapopt, in combination therapy for TP53 mutant AML. We are currently advancing the clinical development of eprenetapopt in TP53 mutant AML through our Phase 1/2 AML trial evaluating eprenetapopt with venetoclax and with or without azacitidine in both frontline and relapsed/refractory AML patients, where there are no approved p53 targeted therapies and a

continued high unmet medical need. We believe that the data generated to date with eprenetapopt combination therapy in TP53 mutant AML support compelling clinical activity in this underserved patient population.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand the clinical opportunity for eprenetapopt by pursuing development of combination therapy for post-transplant maintenance in TP53 mutant MDS and AML. Allo-HCT is currently considered the only curative option for patients with TP53 mutant MDS/AML, and even with transplantation the outcomes for these patients remain poor. We are currently advancing eprenetapopt as post-transplant maintenance therapy in TP53 mutant MDS and AML in our Phase 2 MDS/AML Post-Transplant Trial. We believe that this approach may offer an opportunity to quickly expand the commercial potential of eprenetapopt.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our next-generation p53 reactivator, APR-548, initially in frontline and relapsed/refractory TP53 mutant MDS. We are developing a next-generation small molecule p53 reactivator with the potential to be delivered in an oral dosage form. We intend to initially develop APR-548 in TP53 mutant MDS/AML and we intend to explore additional malignancies for future development. We believe that an oral p53-reactivating drug will improve patient convenience and compliance, if approved, including for patients receiving prolonged therapy in the maintenance setting. We are currently advancing the clinical development of APR-548 in a Phase 1 clinical trial and anticipate the first patient to be enrolled early in the second quarter of 2021. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Explore additional oncology indications for eprenetapopt and APR-548. We are evaluating novel combination treatment with our product candidates in additional hematologic and solid tumor indications where mutant and dysfunctional p53 is a driver of disease. We are also evaluating potential novel combinations of our product candidates to explore secondary mechanisms of action relating to the role of increased cellular stress to induce anti-cancer responses. In addition to the clinical trials that we are currently conducting in Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and advanced solid tumors, we have preclinical models that show synergistic effects of eprenetapopt and APR-548 with a variety of anti-cancer agents including multiple conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, HMAs, inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins and immuno-oncology checkpoint blockade agents. Based on our preclinical data, we believe there is potential to expand eprenetapopt and APR-548 into additional oncological indications.

● | Maximize the commercial opportunity of our product candidates across global markets. We currently retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to all our product candidates. We intend to retain commercial rights to our product candidates in the United States and may elect to build a focused commercial oncology organization to market any of our product candidates that are approved. Outside of the United States, we may elect to selectively evaluate strategic partnership opportunities for our product candidates with partners whose development and commercial capabilities complement our own.

Our approach
Background on p53, a key tumor suppressor protein
TP53 is the most widely mutated gene in human cancers. Since its discovery in 1979, p53 has been extensively studied by researchers and the pharmaceutical industry due to its central role in preventing the initiation and progression of liquid and solid tumors. p53 has long been referred to as “the guardian of the genome” because it is the body’s first line of cellular defense against cancers. Among its multiple biologic functions, p53 regulates a variety of tumor suppressive responses including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence.
p53 is activated when DNA damage is detected and when oxidative or other cellular stresses exceed thresholds for normal cellular function. The result of p53 activation is to facilitate the repair of the cell or trigger killing of the damaged cell, through a process known as apoptosis, before it can become cancerous and replicate. Given that the mutational status of p53 in a tumor has a strong impact on sensitivity to commonly used anti-cancer drugs and radiotherapy, p53 is important both as clinical marker and as a novel therapeutic target. Importantly, mutations in p53 not only diminish tumor suppression function but also often lead to the acquisition of new pro-tumor functions.

9



To date, more than 25,000 unique TP53 mutations have been reported and thus a key challenge in the development of p53-targeted therapies is the vast number of mutations that compromise tumor suppression activity. Incidence of TP53 mutations increases after treatment with chemotherapy or radiation. The most common of these are missense mutations, involving the site-specific exchange of one amino acid for another, and account for 75% of all p53 mutations; however, even the six most frequently mutated “hotspot” missense mutations in p53 collectively represent only ~30% of all missense mutations. Therefore, we believe that a therapeutic agent that targets a small subset of TP53 mutations would be of limited benefit. To circumvent these challenges, previous drug development efforts have primarily focused on gene therapy delivery of wild type p53 or drugs that disrupt interaction with proteins that control p53 activation and abundance. We believe the more effective approach is our direct conformational reactivation of mutant p53 and restoration of wild-type structure and activity, independent of the type of mutation.
Our approach to re-activating p53
One of the most attractive features of apoptosis activation as a cancer therapy is its potential to induce tumor regression rather than to simply stop tumor growth. However, pro-apoptotic agents that cannot discriminate between malignant and normal cells carry a significant risk of side effects. This is an important issue with traditional cancer treatments: radiotherapy and chemotherapy induce apoptosis only as a secondary effect of the cellular damage they induce. These treatments affect most proliferating cells without distinction between malignant or normal cells. Our product candidates, in contrast, are designed to reactivate mutant, non-functional p53 to restore normal apoptotic functions in cancer cells without triggering apoptosis in normal cells, thereby selectively enhancing the effects of other chemotherapy drugs in malignant cancer cells with mutant p53.
Eprenetapopt and MQ, have been extensively studied. MQ-modified mutant p53 protein has been shown to induce significant levels of apoptosis, indicating that covalent binding of MQ activates mutant p53 and induces a p53-dependent apoptotic response. Experiments by our founders looking directly at the conformational state of p53 protein in cells have confirmed that binding of MQ stabilizes mutant p53 in the functional, wild type conformation. Structural biology studies performed by our collaborators have produced the first-ever crystal structures of several single-site missense mutant p53 forms bound to DNA. These structures confirm both the sites of MQ binding to mutant p53 and the stabilization of mutant p53 by MQ in the wild type conformation. Reactivation of mutant p53 via stabilization of the properly folded wild type conformation is the key step in our product candidates’ mechanism of action. The following diagram illustrates this mechanism.
​
​
In in vitro and in vivo experiments, our lead p53 re-activating product candidate, eprenetapopt, via MQ, impaired tumor cells’ capacity to respond to oxidative stress. In parallel to binding mutant p53, and as published by Liu et al, Nat Commun, 2017, 14844, MQ depletes intracellular glutathione, or GSH, and induces reactive oxygen species, or ROS. Furthermore, as published in Peng et al, Cell Death Dis, 2013, e881, MQ has been shown to inhibit the reductase activities of the redox enzyme thioredoxin reductase, or TrxR1, and convert the enzyme to a dedicated oxidase, thereby increasing levels of ROS. Additional results reported in Haffo et al, Sci. Reports, 2018, 12671, have demonstrated MQ inhibition of thioredoxin, or Trx1, and glutaredoxin, or Grx1, which further augment oxidative stress, and ribonucleotide reductase, or RNR, which decreases the cell’s ability to repair damaged DNA. These effects on the cellular redox system, illustrated in the following diagram, may contribute to the anticancer activity of eprenetapopt as well as the selectivity for effects on cancer cells versus healthy normal cells. Malignant cells have higher levels of ROS than healthy 

10



cells and are thus more susceptible to increased stress that can trigger pro-apoptotic responses. MQ-induced oxidative stress is therefore an important secondary feature of the mechanism of action.

Cell fate is a function of the extent and severity of cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress and DNA damage. A network of proteins translates information about cellular stress into biochemical signals and relays this information back to p53, the center of the network. p53 integrates these biochemical signals and becomes activated to initiate cell cycle arrest. When cellular stress and damage are sufficiently high, such as with chemotherapy, p53 initiates apoptosis. MQ restores the ability of a cell to respond to oxidative stress and DNA damage via reactivation of mutant p53 and induces heightened oxidative stress signals to which reactivated p53 can respond. The overlap of these features of the mechanism of action may in turn provide more efficient induction of apoptosis.
Market opportunity for p53 re-activating product candidates
We believe there is a significant market opportunity for therapies targeting mutant p53 because these mutations occur in more than half of all tumors and confer an inferior prognosis relative to patients with wild type p53. Preclinical anti-tumor activity has been observed with eprenetapopt in a wide variety of hematological and solid tumor models and cell lines as reviewed and referenced in Perdrix et al, Cancer 2017, 9, 172. Given the importance of p53 mutations as disease-driver mutations, the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to oxidative stress and continued unmet medical need, we have initially focused our clinical development in hematological malignancies with TP53 mutations.
Myelodysplastic syndromes—disease background and opportunity
MDS is a collection of bone marrow disorders in which malignant hematopoietic cells prevent production of healthy, mature blood cells. Low blood cell counts, called cytopenias, are a hallmark feature of MDS and are a principal cause of morbidity and mortality from infection and bleeding. MDS can develop de novo or may arise secondary to chemotherapy or radiation treatment for a different, prior malignancy or following an antecedent hematological disorder. Treatment-related MDS is associated with increased complex chromosomal abnormalities and carries a worse prognosis than de novo MDS. As of 2019, there are an estimated 200,000 MDS patients worldwide, with 68,000 of these in the United States and 69,000 MDS patients across the five major markets of the European Union and Japan. Globally, MDS prevalence is expected to increase 2-3% annually in mature markets and 3-4% annually in emerging markets as populations age. MDS predominantly affects older adults, with approximately 75% of patients aged 60 years or older at diagnosis. Around 30% of patients diagnosed with MDS will progress to AML, with the rate being higher for patients with more advanced disease.

11



MDS patients are segmented into different risk groups according to the number of cytopenias, bone marrow blast percentage, and cytogenetic abnormalities. The presence of three or more coincident structural genetic abnormalities is classified as a complex karyotype, which correlates with poor prognosis, low response to intensive chemotherapy, high rate of relapse and inferior survival. Mutations in TP53 occur in approximately 20% of patients with de novo MDS and in more than 30% of patients with therapy-related MDS who develop disease secondary to chemotherapy or radiation treatment for other cancers. Sequencing of a panel of commonly mutated genes, including TP53, is standard practice in the diagnosis of MDS.
Historically, treatment response rates in TP53 mutant MDS patients have been poor regardless of therapy. There are no established curative pharmacologic therapies for MDS.Allo-HCT is currently the only recognized therapy believed to increase the likelihood of long-term survival for TP53 mutant MDS patients; however, many patients are not candidates for allo-HCT due to lack of sufficient clinical response to initial therapy, advanced age, comorbidities or lack of a suitable donor. Unfortunately, even for those TP53 mutant MDS patients who receive allo-HCT, the post-transplantation prognosis is poor: TP53 mutations are associated with a 4-fold increased risk of death and 1-year relapse-free survival of only 30% following transplantation.
Given the poor prognosis for patients with TP53 mutant MDS there is a significant need for more effective therapies in this population, particularly if such treatments have a favorable safety profile, a mechanism of action that targets mutant p53 directly, and may be used in combination with existing or future treatment options.
Acute myeloid leukemia—disease background and opportunity
AML is the most common form of adult leukemia, with the highest incidence in patients aged 60 years and older. AML is characterized by proliferation of abnormal immature white blood cells which, like MDS, impairs production of normal blood cells. AML can develop de novo or may arise secondary to progression of other hematologic disorders or from chemotherapy or radiation treatment for a different, prior malignancy; secondary AML carries a worse prognosis than de novo AML. As of 2019, there are an estimated 213,000 AML patients worldwide, with 37,000 of these in the United States and 41,000 across the five major European Union markets and Japan. Globally, AML prevalence is expected to increase approximately 1-2% annually in mature markets and 2-3% in emerging markets.
AML patients are segmented into different risk groups according to cytogenetic abnormalities. The presence of three or more coincident structural genetic abnormalities is classified as a complex karyotype, which correlates with adverse prognosis, low response to intensive chemotherapy, high rate of relapse and inferior survival. Mutations in TP53 occur in approximately 20% of patients with newly diagnosed AML, more than 30% of patients with therapy-related AML and approximately 70-80% of patients with complex karyotype. Sequencing of a panel of commonly mutated genes, including TP53, is standard practice in the diagnosis of AML.
Historically, treatment response rates in TP53 mutant AML patients have been poor regardless of therapy. Similar to MDS, allo-HCT is currently the only recognized therapy believed to increase the likelihood of long-term survival for TP53 mutant AML patients; however, many patients are not candidates for allo-HCT due to lack of sufficient clinical response to therapy, advanced age, comorbidities or lack of a suitable donor. Unfortunately, even for those TP53 mutant AML patients who receive allo-HCT, the post-transplantation prognosis is poor: TP53 mutations are associated with a 4-fold increased risk of death and 1-year relapse-free survival of only 30% following transplantation.
Given the poor prognosis for patients with TP53 mutant AML there is a significant need for more effective therapies in this population, particularly if such treatments have a favorable safety profile, a mechanism of action that targets mutant p53 directly, and may be used in combination with existing or future treatment options.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia—disease background and opportunity
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal lymphocytes. As of 2017, the estimated prevalence of CLL was approximately 205,000 in the United States and approximately 180,000 across the five major European Union markets and Japan.

12



CLL is associated with a highly heterogeneous disease course that is partly explained by the diverse genetic aberrations identified in CLL patients. Deletions in chromosome 17p [del(17p)] and TP53 mutations belong to the strongest prognostic and predictive markers guiding treatment decisions in CLL. Del(17p) results in loss of one copy of the TP53 gene and is often accompanied by mutation in the remaining TP53 gene copy. TP53 mutation occurs in approximately 25% of CLL and up to approximately 85% of del(17p) CLL. TP53 mutant CLL and del(17p) CLL are associated with markedly decreased survival and impaired response to therapy and many patients will experience disease relapse and progression.
Mantle cell lymphoma—disease background and opportunity
​
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive form of NHL that accounts for approximately 6% of all NHL cases. It is characterized by accumulation of malignant B lymphocytes in the outer edge, or mantle zone, of lymph node follicles. As of 2017, the estimated prevalence of MCL was approximately 16,000 in the United States and approximately 16,000 across the five major European Union markets and Japan.
There are two major variants of MCL, known as classical and leukemic non-nodal (L-NN). Classical nodal MCL, accounting for 80-90% of cases, affects the lymph nodes and extra nodal sites. In contrast, L-NN MCL involves the bone marrow, peripheral blood and spleen. Of these, classical MCL is the more aggressive disease. Like CLL, del(17p) and TP53 mutation are the most frequent findings in MCL. TP53 mutations occur in approximately 20% of cases and are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to first-line and later-line regimens. There is no standard of care therapy for relapsed/refractory MCL but ibrutinib is a preferred treatment option.
Gastric cancer—disease background and opportunity
Gastric cancer includes cancers of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction. It is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. In 2020, the estimated prevalence of gastric cancer is approximately 45,000 in the United States, approximately 90,000 in the five major European Union markets and approximately 350,000 in Japan.
Gastric cancer is typically detected at an advanced stage and disease progression after first-line chemotherapy is common. TP53 mutation occurs in approximately 35%-55% of gastric cancers, and up to 90% in high-risk populations. Therapeutic options are limited for patients whose disease progresses after two or more lines of treatment. The humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with recurrent gastric cancer after two or more prior lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy and, if appropriate, HER2/new-targeted therapy, and whose tumors express PD-L1. 
Bladder cancer—disease background and opportunity
Bladder cancer is a common cancer worldwide and is more common in men than in women. In 2018, the estimated prevalence of bladder cancer was approximately 275,000 in the United States, approximately 370,000 in the five major European Union markets and approximately 120,000 in Japan.
TP53 mutation occurs in approximately 50% of bladder cancer cases. First-line treatment with platinum agents is standard of care; however, few therapeutic options exist for second-line treatment of patients with platinum-refractory bladder cancer. The humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic, PD-L1 positive bladder cancer who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy; in patients who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status; and in patients who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Non-small cell lung cancer—disease background and opportunity
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of all lung cancer diagnoses. In 2019, the 

13



estimated prevalence of NSCLC was approximately 312,000 in the United States, 194,000 in the five major European Union markets and approximately 312,000 in Japan.
TP53 mutation occurs in up to 80% of NSCLC cases. The humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, is approved by the US FDA as a single agent in NSCLC for the first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive metastatic disease or in patients who have progressive disease during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Treatment options are limited for patients whose disease is R/R to prior anti-PD-1 therapy.
Our lead product candidate, eprenetapopt
Our lead product candidate, eprenetapopt, is a small molecule that has demonstrated reactivation of mutant p53 in both clinical trials and preclinical studies. Promising clinical and preclinical data support the application of eprenetapopt across a variety of hematologic malignancies and other oncologic indications. Based on its mechanism of action of p53 reactivation and the complementary increase in oxidative stress, as well as its established synergy with anti-cancer agents as evidenced in preclinical studies, eprenetapopt treatment may be effective in a broad range of clinical settings.
Clinical trials of eprenetapopt in hematologic malignancies
We are currently evaluating eprenetapopt with azacitidine for the treatment of TP53 mutant MDS and/or AML patients, including frontline therapy, relapsed/refractory, or R/R, therapy and post-allo-HCT maintenance therapy; and relapsed/refractory TP53 mutant NHL patients.
The Phase 3 MDS Trial
​
We are conducting a Phase 3 trial of eprenetapopt with azacitidine in TP53 mutant MDS patients. The trial was fully enrolled with 154 patients randomized 1:1 to either the azacitidine control arm or to the eprenetapopt + azacitidine experimental arm. The primary endpoint of the trial was CR rate. In December 2020 we announced that the Phase 3 trial failed to meet the predefined CR primary endpoint at the primary data cut. In the intention to treat population of 154 patients the CR rate in the eprenetapopt with azacitidine arm was 33.3% (95% CI: 23.1 – 44.9%) compared to 22.4% (95% CI: 13.6 – 33.4%) in the azacitidine alone arm (P = 0.13). Analysis of the primary endpoint at this data cut demonstrated a 53% higher number of patients achieving a CR in the experimental arm receiving eprenetapopt with azacitidine versus the control arm receiving azacitidine alone but did not reach statistical significance.
 ​
While analysis of certain secondary endpoints (ORR and duration of responses) appears to favor the experimental arm, the differences are not statistically significant. Additional patients in the study who have not achieved a CR remain on study treatment and the data will be analyzed at future pre-specified timepoints as set forth in the statistical analysis plan. 
The combination of eprenetapopt with azacitidine appeared well-tolerated, with an adverse event profile that was similar to that of our other Phase 2 trials. As of March 2, 2021, the most common (≥20%) adverse events in patients in the Phase 3 with MDS who received eprenetapopt with azacitidine were nausea (64%), constipation (63%), vomiting (53%), anemia (47%), neutrophil count decreased (43%), febrile neutropenia (42%), fatigue (41%), white blood cell count decreased (39%), platelet count decreased (33%), headache (33%), dizziness (32%), pyrexia (30%), diarrhea (29%), peripheral edema (25%), cough (24%), thrombocytopenia (24%), hypokalemia (24%), injection site reaction (21%), neutropenia (21%), and decreased appetite (21%). Fatal adverse events occurred in 17% of patients who received eprenetapopt and azacitidine; of these, 3 were reported by an investigator as possibly related to eprenetapopt and azacitidine and 1 as possibly related to eprenetapopt only. The most common (≥5%) serious adverse events in patients who received eprenetapopt with azacitidine were febrile neutropenia (33%), pneumonia (12%), pyrexia (11%), sepsis (9%), muscular weakness (7%) and respiratory failure (5%).
We are continuing our analysis of the data from this Phase 3 clinical trial and subsequent analyses of the trial data, including secondary endpoints, will be conducted as the duration of patient follow-up increases. We intend to provide a further update in the second quarter of 2021 and expect to present additional data from the trial at a future scientific conference.

The U.S. Phase 1b/2 MDS/AML Trial
We supported an investigator-initiated Phase 1b/2 single-arm, open-label, multi-center trial in the United States of eprenetapopt with azacitidine in HMA-naïve patients with TP53 mutant myeloid neoplasms including MDS and AML. The primary endpoint of the trial was CR rate. Results of the trial were published with open access by Sallman and colleagues in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in January 2021. 
The trial included a Phase 1b dose-escalation part that enrolled 12 patients and a Phase 2 part that enrolled 43 patients. Most patients were higher-risk MDS (65%) or AML (20%), with complex karyotype (84%). High risk patients with complex karyotypes and TP53 mutation have been reported to have the poorest prognosis of all MDS and AML patients.
In the intention-to-treat population reported by Sallman et al, the ORR was 71% (95% CI: 57 – 82%) and 44% of patients achieved a CR. In the 40 MDS patients the ORR was 73% (95% CI: 56 – 85%) with 50% achieving a CR. In the 11 AML patients the ORR was 64% (95% CI: 31 – 89%) with 36% achieving a CR. In MDS patients the median duration of response in was 8.4 months (95% CI: 6.5 – 13.2 months) and the median duration of CR was 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.8 months – not estimable). In AML patients the median duration of response was 7.5 months (95% CI: 4.2 months – not estimable) and the median duration of CR was 7.0 months (95% CI: 3.3 months – not estimable). Twenty-one MDS/AML patients discontinued treatment for allo-HCT, as transplant is viewed as a potentially curative option for patients with TP53 mutant MDS and AML. At a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, the median OS in the intention-to-treat population was 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.1 − 13.4 months), which was similar between the MDS (10.4 months; 95% CI: 7.6 – 13.3 months) and AML (10.8 months; 95% CI: 5.1 – 16.5 months) disease cohorts.
The most common (≥20%) adverse events reported by Sallman et al were nausea (64%), vomiting (45%), fatigue (44%), constipation (42%), edema (38%), dizziness (36%), diarrhea (33%), febrile neutropenia (33%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (31%), leukopenia (31%), dyspnea (29%), headache (29%), lung infection (29%), neutropenia (29%), thrombocytopenia (29%), cough (27%), pruritus (25%), anorexia (24%), ataxia (24%), fever (22%), alanine aminotransferase increased (20%), mucositis oral (20%) and tremor (20%). As of March 2, 2021, fatal adverse events occurred in 13% of patients; none were reported by an investigator as possibly related to eprenetapopt or to azacitidine. The most common (≥5%) serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (33%), pneumonia (25%), sepsis (11%), pyrexia (7%), dehydration (5%), embolism (5%), muscle weakness (5%), respiratory failure (5%) and vomiting (5%).
The French Phase 1b/2 MDS/AML Trial
We are supporting an ongoing investigator-initiated single-arm, open-label Phase 1b/2 trial in France of eprenetapopt with azacitidine in HMA-naïve patients with TP53 mutant MDS and AML. The primary endpoint of the trial was CR rate. Results of the trial were published with open access by Cluzeau and colleagues in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in February 2021. 
The trial enrolled 52 patients. Most patients were higher-risk MDS (58%) or AML (35%) with complex karyotype (87%). High risk patients with complex karyotype and TP53 mutation have been reported to have the poorest prognosis of all MDS and AML patients.
In the intention-to-treat population reported by Cluzeau et al, the ORR was 52% with 37% of patients achieving CR. In the 34 MDS patients the ORR was 62% with 47% achieving a CR. In the 18 AML patients the ORR was 33% with 17% achieving a CR. In MDS patients the median duration of response was 10.4 months (95% CI: 2.8 – 16.8 months) and the median duration of CR was 11.4 months (95% CI: 6.5 - 16.8 months). In AML patients the median duration of response was 12.7 months (95% CI: 6.0 – 17.3 months) and the median duration of CR was 14.0 months (95% CI: 11.3 – 17.3 months). At a median follow-up time of 9.7 months, the median OS in the intention-to-treat population was 12.1 months (95% CI: 8.1 – 13.4 months). Median OS was 12.1 months for MDS patients and 10.4 months for AML patients and this difference was not significant (P = 0.92).
The most common (≥20%) adverse events reported by Cluzeau et al were febrile neutropenia (37%) and ataxia (25%). As of March 2, 2021, fatal adverse events occurred in 23% of patients; of these, 4 were reported by an investigator as possibly related to azacitidine and none were reported by an investigator as related to eprenetapopt. The most common 

15



(≥5%) serious adverse advents were febrile neutropenia (27%), device related infection (12%), pneumonia (8%), sepsis (8%), corona virus infection (6%) and lung disorder (6%).
The Phase 2 MDS/AML Post-transplant Trial
There is a significant unmet medical need for more effective therapies for patients with TP53 mutant AML and MDS following allo-HCT given that the one-year post-transplant relapse-free survival, or RFS, rate is only 30%. In the second quarter of 2019, we opened enrollment to our Phase 2 MDS/AML Post-Transplant Trial to evaluate the adverse event profile and the clinical benefit of eprenetapopt with azacitidine in TP53 mutant MDS and AML patients who have received allo-HCT. The primary endpoint of the trial is the rate of RFS at 1 year. Enrollment is complete with 33 patients included in the trial. We anticipate initial availability of data on the primary endpoint of 1-year RFS in the second quarter of 2021.
As of March 2, 2021, fatal adverse events occurred in one patient and was not reported as related to study treatment. The most common (≥5%) serious adverse events were pyrexia (12%), confusional state (6%), dyspnea (6%) and febrile neutropenia (6%).
The Phase 1/2 AML Trial
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the adverse event profile and efficacy of treatment with eprenetapopt and venetoclax with or without azacitidine, in frontline and R/R TP53 mutant AML. In preclinical studies, we have observed strong synergy when eprenetapopt and venetoclax are combined in TP53 mutant AML cell lines and believe that this combination may provide meaningful improvements in durable responses for TP53 mutant AML patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory AML.
In the AML trial, frontline and R/R TP53 mutant AML patients who have received prior HMA therapy receive treatment with eprenetapopt and venetoclax, and frontline patients who are HMA-naïve receive treatment with eprenetapopt, venetoclax and azacitidine. The primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen. The lead-in portion of the trial evaluated the tolerability of eprenetapopt with venetoclax, with or without azacitidine, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 12 patients receiving either regimen. Based on these results, we have expanded the trial to treat 33 additional frontline TP53 mutant AML patients with the combination of eprenetapopt, venetoclax and azacitidine. We also may activate a separate cohort in the trial to evaluate the combination of eprenetapopt with azacitidine in approximately 30 frontline TP53 mutant AML patients. 
In addition to the 6 patients enrolled in the lead-in phase, we have enrolled 22 patients into the expansion arm for the eprenetapopt + venetoclax + azacitidine triplet therapy, of whom 13 have undergone repeat bone marrow biopsy and are evaluable for response. As of February 25, 2021, the combined CR + CRi rate in these 19 patients is 63%, including 31% CR. We anticipate completion of enrollment in the triplet regimen expansion cohort during the second quarter of 2021 and availability of preliminary response rate data from the cohort also in the second quarter of 2021. As warranted by adverse event and efficacy data, we may further expand enrollment into this triplet regimen in the Phase 2 part to potentially enable a path to registration in frontline AML. 
As of March 2, 2021, fatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients, none of which were reported by an investigator as related to study treatment. The most common (≥5%) serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (41%), sepsis (15%), pneumonia (12%), muscular weakness (9%), subdural hematoma (9%), blood bilirubin increased (6%), diverticulitis (6%), nausea (6%) and pyrexia (6%).
The Phase 1 NHL Trial
We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the adverse event profile and preliminary efficacy of eprenetapopt with venetoclax and rituximab, and eprenetapopt with ibrutinib in R/R TP53 mutant CLL. The first patient was enrolled on the first quarter of 2021. We intend to expand the number of patients in individual arms of the trial in a Phase 2 part, as warranted by adverse event and efficacy data. We are also planning to evaluate the combination of eprenetapopt with venetoclax in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

Clinical development in solid tumors
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Eprenetapopt in R/R Gastric, Bladder and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers
We are currently enrolling a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the adverse event profile and preliminary efficacy of eprenetapopt with anti-PD-1 therapy in advanced solid tumors including R/R gastric cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. In preclinical studies reported by Ghosh and colleagues from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center at the 2019 AACR annual meeting, we have observed synergy in mouse cancer models when eprenetapopt was combined with immuno-oncology agents, including anti-PD-1. The trial is enrolling both TP53 mutant and TP53 wild-type patients.
Enrollment of the safety lead-in cohort was completed and no dose-limiting toxicities were reported for the 6 patients enrolled. Enrollment of the gastric, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer expansion cohorts is ongoing and we have currently enrolled 8 patients across these expansion arms. Preliminary tolerability and efficacy data is anticipated in the second half of 2021.
As of March 2, 2021, fatal adverse events occurred in one patient and was not reported by investigators as related to study treatment. No serious adverse events, regardless of causality, have been reported in more than one patient.
Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial of Eprenetapopt in Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer, or PiSARRO
As part of the early development strategy, eprenetapopt was evaluated in clinical trials in ovarian cancer and this decision was based on the anticipated market size and high prevalence of TP53 mutation of greater than 95% in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, or HGSOC. In March 2014, a Phase 1b trial was initiated as a part of a combined Phase 1b/2 protocol in platinum-sensitive HGSOC to evaluate eprenetapopt with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or PLD. All patients had previously been treated with platinum-based antineoplastic agents and all had accumulation of p53, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, or IHC, as a surrogate marker of mutant p53. Archival samples were available for 29 patients, of which 27 had DNA of sufficient quality for sequencing and all 27 were confirmed to be TP53 mutant.
The Phase 1b part of the trial was conducted as a dose-escalation in 35 platinum-sensitive and partially platinum-sensitive patients. The primary trial objectives of the Phase 1b portion were to assess the adverse event profile of eprenetapopt with carboplatin and PLD, to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose level, or RP2D, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of eprenetapopt with carboplatin and PLD. Tumor response was a secondary objective.
The most frequently reported eprenetapopt -related AEs were nausea, dizziness, and fatigue, of which most were low-grade. A limited number of eprenetapopt -related grade 3+ AEs were reported, including neutropenia (37%), vomiting (14%), thrombocytopenia (9%), dizziness (6%), anemia (6%), fatigue (3%), headache (3%) and decreased appetite (3%). The most common (>5%) serious adverse events, regardless of causality, were device related infection (17%), vomiting (17%), febrile neutropenia (9%), infection (6%), small intestinal obstruction (6%) and thrombocytopenia (6%).
Although efficacy was not a Phase 1b trial objective, tumor response was evaluated. A 67% ORR was observed in 27 patients who were evaluable for radiological response according to RECIST 1.1, including 11% with complete response and 56% with partial response. In addition, an 84% ORR was observed in 25 patients who were evaluable for CA-125 response according to Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup, or GCIG, criteria. All patients who were evaluable by RECIST 1.1 achieved a best response of stable disease or better, where stable disease indicates lack of objective response but without disease progression. The median time between prior platinum therapy and disease progression prior to enrollment in the trial, known as platinum free interval, or PFI, was 9.4 months, and 40% of patients had received more than one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy. Two-thirds of patients enrolled in the trial were partially platinum-sensitive, with PFI 6-12 months. The remaining one-third of patients were platinum-sensitive, with PFI greater than 12 months. The median progression-free survival, or PFS, was 10.2 months across all patients and was 10 months and 11.4 months in partially platinum-sensitive and platinum sensitive patients, respectively. The median OS was 

17



24.3 months. This was the first clinical trial of eprenetapopt with cytotoxic chemotherapy and we believe that the data demonstrated that the agent can be combined with carboplatin and PLD at standard doses.
Data supporting the carboplatin and PLD doublet as a treatment option in platinum-sensitive HGSOC were generated in the CALYPSO trial, a phase 3 clinical trial sponsored by an international consortium of 10 cancer research organizations. The CALYPSO trial enrolled 976 patients, randomized to receive either carboplatin and PLD (48%) or carboplatin and paclitaxel (52%). All patients had received a maximum of two prior lines of chemotherapy; in the carboplatin and PLD arm, 88% had received one prior line and 12% had received two prior lines. The median interval since last chemotherapy, or therapy-free interval, was 15.2 months in the carboplatin and PLD arm, of whom 35% had a therapy-free interval of 6-12 months and 65% had a therapy-free interval in excess of 12 months. The most frequently reported AEs in the carboplatin and PLD arm included neutropenia (80%), nausea (78%), fatigue (78%), anemia (66%), constipation (55%) and vomiting (49%). The most common grade 3+ AEs included neutropenia (35%), thrombocytopenia (16%) and anemia (8%). In the carboplatin and PLD arm PFS was reported as 11.3 months and OS as 30.7 months. Median PFS in the carboplatin and PLD arm was greater than the 9.4 months PFS in the carboplatin and paclitaxel arm (hazard ratio: 0.821, 95% CI, 0.72 – 0.94, P = 0.005). Historically, Phase 3 clinical trials in ovarian cancer, including the CALYPSO trial, have enrolled approximately 500 – 1000 patients to demonstrate statistical significance in PFS.
In the third quarter of 2016, enrollment commenced in the Phase 2 portion of the PiSARRO trial and enrollment was concluded at 211 patients in April 2018. The Phase 2 part was an open-label, randomized, controlled multi-center trial to assess whether patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent HGSOC would benefit from treatment with eprenetapopt in combination with carboplatin/PLD chemotherapy regimen. All patients were required to have accumulation of p53 as assessed by immunohistochemistry. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 part was PFS, defined as the time from registration to the time of disease progression or relapse or death, or the date of last tumor assessment without any such event.
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eprenetapopt with carboplatin and PLD (Arm A) or carboplatin and PLD only (Arm B), with treatment to be repeated every 28 days for up to six cycles. Of 105 patients enrolled in Arm A, 99 received eprenetapopt with carboplatin and PLD and 96 patients were efficacy-evaluable. Of 106 patients enrolled in Arm B, 101 patients received carboplatin and PLD and 97 patients were efficacy-evaluable. 
In Arm A, 10 patients (9.5%) achieved CR compared to 3 patients (2.8%) in Arm B; overall response rate (CR+PR) was 49.5% in Arm A (n=52) and 50.0% in Arm B (n=53). Median duration of response by RECIST v1.1 in Arm A was 231 days (95% CI: 198 - 256 days) and 213 days (95% CI: 184 - 265 days) in Arm B (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.58-1.45). In the intention-to-treat population, median PFS duration based on RECIST v1.1 adjusting for three stratification factors including platinum-free interval (>6 to12 vs. >12 to<24 months), BRCA status (known positive vs. other) and prior lines of platinum treatment (1 vs. 2) was 283 days (95% CI: 240 days, 314 days) in Arm A patients (n=105) that received APR 246 in combination with carboplatin/PLD therapy, as compared to 295 days (95% CI: 259 days, 335 days) in Arm B patients (n=106) that received carboplatin/PLD therapy alone (HR 1.32, 95% CI: 0.95-1.83, P = 0.10). In Arm A, the median OS duration was 600 days (95% CI: 543 days – not estimable) compared to 620 days in Arm B (95% CI: 504 - 741 days) (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.59-1.38, P = 0.64).
Eprenetapopt in combination with carboplatin and PLD was generally well tolerated and adverse events were generally transient and reversible. The most common (≥20%) adverse events in Arm A were nausea (68%), neutropenia (57%), fatigue (48%), vomiting (42%), dizziness (42%), constipation (36%), anemia (31%), thrombocytopenia (23%) and mucosal inflammation (20%). No patients in Arm A died while on-study or within 30 days after last dose. The most common serious adverse events were related to gastrointestinal disorders (13%), and infections and infestations (8%). In Arm A there were no serious adverse events that occurred in ≥5% of patients. 
​
Recruitment to the study was concluded in April 2018 and the final results indicate that a statistically significant difference in the PFS, OS, ORR, and DOR was not observed across the two arms in the limited number of patients enrolled to the study. We believe that the combination of eprenetapopt with carboplatin and PLD was tolerable and that a larger study would be required to determine a difference in the efficacy endpoints of the study, including the rate of CR, which was observed in the study to be substantially higher in the experimental arm. We believe this study further 

18



supports the clinical development of eprenetapopt as a potential therapy in cancers where TP53 mutations are indicated to be contributing to the prognosis and disease progression.
​
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Eprenetapopt in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer, or PiSARRO-R
In July 2017 we initiated an open-label, multicenter Phase 2 trial, PiSARRO-R, to evaluate the adverse event profile and preliminary efficacy of varying infusion regimens of eprenetapopt with systemic PLD chemotherapy in platinum-resistant HGSOC. The trial enrolled 36 patients and all patients were required to have recurrent disease with PFI between 4 weeks and 6 months, and accumulation of p53 as assessed by immunohistochemistry. A significant majority (69%) of patients had received 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients received either a 4500 mg/d fixed dose of eprenetapopt as a 6-hour intravenous infusion (n=28, 78%), or the same or lower fixed dose over 3 or 4 hours (n=8, 22%) for four consecutive days, followed by 40 mg/m2 PLD on Day 4. 
​
Across all patients enrolled in the trial the most common (≥20%) adverse events were nausea (64%), vomiting (53%), constipation (39%), abdominal pain (36%), fatigue (36%), decreased appetite (33%), asthenia (28%), mucosal inflammation (25%), dizziness (25%), anemia (25%), diarrhea (22%), Nine patients died while on-study and 2 patients died within 30 days of last dose; all deaths were due to disease progression. The most common serious adverse events were related to gastrointestinal disorders (25%) and were not increased with shorter duration of infusion. There were no serious adverse events that occurred in ≥5% of patients enrolled in the PiSARRO-R trial. We believe the available adverse event data from the trial demonstrates that reduced duration infusion regimens with eprenetapopt are feasible.
​
Our second product candidate, APR-548
We are developing a next-generation small molecule mutant p53 reactivator, APR-548, a novel pro-drug of MQ that has the potential to be administered in an oral dosage form. Our initial development of APR-548 is in TP53 mutant hematological malignancies and we intend to explore additional malignancies for future development. We believe that an oral p53-reactivating drug will improve patient convenience and compliance, if approved, including for patients receiving prolonged therapy in the maintenance setting.
In preclinical testing we have observed potency with APR-548 that was superior to that of eprenetapopt in a Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line expressing an Arg273His mutant p53 and the MIA-PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line harboring an Arg248Trp mutant p53. The half maximal inhibitory concentration, or IC50, in the Saos-2 cell line was calculated to be 5.6 μM ± 1.0 μM (n=3) for APR-548 and 9.5 μM ± 1.2 μM (n=37) for eprenetapopt, representing an approximately 40% reduction in IC50 with APR-548. In the MIA-PaCa-2 cell line, the IC50 for APR-548 was calculated to be 6.0 μM (n=1) versus 19 μM (n=1) for eprenetapopt, representing a nearly 70% reduction in IC50 with APR-548.

In xenograft studies in which mice were implanted with a mutant TP53 breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231-luc, we tested the in vivo efficacy of APR-548 when administered as a single agent by twice-daily oral (PO) gavage. In these studies, mice received APR-548 for three cycles where each cycle consisted of 5 consecutive days of dosing followed by 2 days without dosing. Tumor growth inhibition was assessed by measurement of tumor weight at 

20



post-mortem examination on day 33 post-inoculation. In mice receiving APR-548 via oral administration, we observed reductions in tumor weight relative to untreated control mice. Results from these studies are summarized in the following graph.

We received authorization to proceed under an IND for APR-548 on October 2, 2020 and have planned a Phase 1 clinical trial of APR-548 with azacitidine in frontline and relapsed/refractory TP53 mutant MDS patients. We anticipate enrollment of the first patient early in the second quarter of 2021.
We have developed a scalable, high-purity process for the manufacture of APR-548 and have completed development of a prototype tablet formulation that provides for rapid dissolution and is well-suited for automated production.
Manufacturing
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for certain preclinical trials and clinical trial materials, including raw materials and consumables necessary for their manufacture, consistent with applicable cGMP requirements. We routinely assess both capacity and the current clinical supply chain associated with 

21



the production of eprenetapopt and are not currently aware of any disruption to our ability to provide supply for our on-going clinical trials. We will continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our clinical trial supply chain. We intend to continue to contract for these materials in the future, including commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We do not own or operate cGMP manufacturing facilities, nor do we currently plan to build our own cGMP manufacturing capabilities for the production of our product candidates for clinical or commercial use. Although we rely upon contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for IND-enabling trials and clinical trials, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience who oversee our contract manufacturers. In the future, we may also rely upon collaboration partners, in addition to contract manufacturers, for the manufacture of our product candidates or any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for eprenetapopt is currently manufactured by a single contract manufacturer. Although we may do so in the future, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of the API for eprenetapopt. We contract with a different manufacturer for formulation of drug product, sterile fill of vials, labeling and packaging, and the storage and distribution of eprenetapopt to clinical sites. We believe that these third parties have sufficient capacity to meet our current demand and, in the event they fail to meet our demand, we believe that adequate alternative sources for the supply of materials for eprenetapopt exist. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the API and other services for eprenetapopt prior to seeking marketing approval for eprenetapopt.
We believe that, because eprenetapopt is a small molecule, it can be manufactured through reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available raw materials and then purified and packaged for clinical use. We believe that the chemistry process is amenable to scale-up and requires only customary equipment in the manufacturing process.
We have a manufacturing and supply agreement and quality agreement with Syngene International Private Limited for the manufacture of API. We have a service agreement with Cobra Biopharma for the clinical manufacture, labeling and packaging of formulated drug product. We have a manufacturing and supply agreements and quality agreement with Siegfried Hameln GmbH for the manufacture, supply, labeling and packaging of formulated drug product.
Manufacturing clinical products is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our contract manufacturers are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice regulations, which are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally, and the cancer drug sector specifically, are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, evolving understanding of disease etiology and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our product candidates, development capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face significant potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including the indications for which we may develop product candidates. Many of the companies that we compete against or may compete against in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

22



Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and therapy with drugs or biologics. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently-approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and may be established as standard of care for the treatment of indications for which we may choose to seek regulatory approvals. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors, and even if our drug candidates were to be approved, there can be no assurance that our drugs would displace existing treatments.
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of drugs in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer, including for the treatment of the indications for which we are developing product candidates. These clinical-stage drug candidates may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently-marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval.
We are developing our lead product candidate, eprenetapopt and APR-548, to reactivate p53 for the treatment of various cancers. We are aware of other product candidates that are in clinical development as potential treatments of various cancers through the reactivation of p53. Although there is a subset of drugs that directly target the p53 pathway, there are many cancer drugs that claim to affect the p53 pathway by upstream or complementary pathways. We are aware of molecules in development that also are being explored for p53 upregulation / activation in various stages of clinical development being tested by Actavalon, Inc., CDG Therapeutics, Inc., Cotinga Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Innovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MedVax Technologies, Inc., PMV Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Senhwa Biosciences, Inc., among others. We are also aware of selective small molecule inhibitors that are designed to target the p53-MDM2 interaction in various stages of clinical development being tested by F-Hoffman La Roche Ltd and Hoffman La Roche Inc., or collectively Roche, Amgen Inc., Novartis AG, Kartos Therapeutics, Inc., Aileron Therapeutics and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (out licensed worldwide rights to Rain Therapeutics, Inc.), including testing MDM2 inhibitors in combination with a variety of other anti-cancer agents. Finally, we are aware of several small molecules that are designed to inhibit the activity of Bcl-2 and the related protein Mcl-1 and relieve inhibition of the apoptotic cascade. Abbvie Inc.’s venetoclax has been approved in AML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; companies with Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 inhibitors in various stages of preclinical or clinical development include Amgen Inc., Servier SAS, AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc. and Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., among others.
If eprenetapopt were approved for the indications for which we currently have ongoing clinical trials, it would compete with currently-marketed drugs and would likely compete with other drugs that are currently in clinical development, each as discussed below.
MDS / AML
The front-line treatments for patients with higher-risk MDS in the United States are combination chemotherapy or HMAs such as Dacogen (decitabine) or Vidaza (azacitidine).

Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Gilead Sciences Inc., Incyte Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Juno Therapeutics Inc., Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Merck & Co Inc., and TG Therapeutics Inc.
​
Gastric cancer
The preferred treatment options for R/R gastric cancer in the United States are dependent on regimens received in first-line therapy as well as patient performance status. Second- and later-line treatments include taxanes, fluoropyrimidines, ramucirumab, irinotecan and pembrolizumab. We are aware of several ongoing clinical trials aimed at expanding the use of approved chemotherapy and immunomodulatory agents in R/R gastric cancer, as well as several new clinical programs testing novel technologies in this area, including product candidates from Altor Bioscience LLC, BeiGene Ltd, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Incyte Corp, Merck & Co Inc., Pfizer Inc., and TG Therapeutics Inc.
​
Bladder cancer
The preferred treatment option for R/R bladder cancer in the United States is the anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, Alternative regimens include other anti-PD-1 antibodies, antibodies targeting PD-L1 or CD274, FGFR inhibitors, taxanes, and topoisomerase inhibitors. We are aware of several ongoing clinical trials aimed at expanding the use of approved chemotherapy and immunomodulatory agents in R/R bladder cancer, as well as several new clinical programs testing novel technologies in this area, including product candidates from Altor Bioscience LLC, AstraZeneca Plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, and Merck & Co Inc.
​
NSCLC
The preferred treatment options for R/R NSCLC depend on tumor subtype and the presence of tumor biomarkers such as genetic mutations or PD-L1 expression. Therapeutic agents include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, platinum agents, taxanes, and topoisomerase inhibitors. We are aware of several ongoing clinical trials aimed at expanding the use of approved chemotherapy and immunomodulatory agents in R/R NSCLC, as well as several new clinical programs testing novel technologies in this area, including product candidates from AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca Plc., Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Gilead Sciences Inc., Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Milennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Pfizer Inc.
​
Intellectual property
​
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the methods-of-use, formulations, dosing, manufacturing processes, and crystalline solid form of one or more of our product candidates, including eprenetapopt, and composition of matter of our other product candidates, related technology, and other inventions that are important to our business.

24



Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. If it becomes necessary for us to use patented or proprietary technology of third parties to develop or commercialize our product candidates, we may need to seek a license from such third parties. Our business could be harmed, possibly materially, if we are unable to obtain such a license on terms that are commercially reasonable, or at all.
We may seek to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment, diagnostics, and additional compounds and their derivatives. Specifically, we have sought and will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds of our product candidates other than eprenetapopt and a crystal form of eprenetapopt, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies. The chemical structure of eprenetapopt is in the public domain. Accordingly, we do not own or license any composition of matter patents claiming the compound of eprenetapopt and will not in the future own or license any composition of matter patents claiming the chemical structure of eprenetapopt as described in the public domain.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings at the USPTO or at a foreign patent office, such as inter partes review and post grant review proceedings at the USPTO and opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Intellectual property protection
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent holder to apply for patent term extension of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, which, if granted, can extend the patent term of such patent to compensate for part of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. This extension can be for up to five years beyond the original expiration date of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. While we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our patents in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology, know-how and other aspects our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or 

28



research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulation
Government regulation and product approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drug products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and approval of drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, debarment, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and other applicable regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29




● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
Preclinical studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, a sponsor must submit, among other things, a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor may be a company seeking to develop the drug or, as in the case of an investigator-initiated trial, the sponsor may be an investigator who is conducting the trial. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is 

30



not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, FDA has promulgated regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical trials not conducted under an IND, establishing that such studies will be accepted as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and use of proper procedures for obtaining informed consent from subjects, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if FDA deems such inspection necessary. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. If a marketing application is based solely on foreign clinical data, the FDA requires that the foreign data be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies must have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the FDA must be able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means, if the FDA deems such an inspection to be necessary.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials in support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.

31



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

Phase 1: | | The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. | ​
Phase 2: | ​ | The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. | ​
Phase 3: | ​ | The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. | ​
Phase 4: | ​ | Post-approval studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. | ​

​
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious AEs occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions for which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from several alternative sources, including investigator-initiated trials that are not sponsored by company. Under federal law, the submission of NDAs requiring clinical data is additionally subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2021 is $2,875,842. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which for fiscal year 2021 are $336,432 per eligible product.

32



The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the filing date, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as APIs), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new product candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a product candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application 

33



does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated approval pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval 

34



studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
The FDA’s decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-approval requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the NDA holder may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, including total or partial suspension of production, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35




● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in a manner and for uses consistent with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription drug products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Abbreviated new drug applications for generic drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the API, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. An applicant may submit an ANDA suitability petition to request the FDA’s prior permission to submit an abbreviated application for a drug that differs from the RLD in route of administration, dosage form, or strength, or for a drug that has one different active ingredient in a fixed-combination drug product (i.e., a drug product with multiple active ingredients). At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists may consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years from the date the NDA is approved, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a listed patent for the RLD is 

36



invalid or will not be infringed by the drug that is the subject of the ANDA, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would only be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it does, however, block the FDA from approving ANDAs during the period of exclusivity. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional bridging studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. An RLD’s unexpired non-patent exclusivities would also block FDA from accepting or approving 505(b)(2) NDAs in the same way as they apply to ANDAs.
Hatch-Waxman patent certification and the 30-Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods-of-use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the 

37



listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from granting final approval of the application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
Pediatric studies and exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data.
Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. FDA may only grant pediatric exclusivity if existing patent or exclusivity protections for the drug would otherwise expire at least 9 months after the grant of the pediatric exclusivity; FDA has 180 days to make a pediatric exclusivity determination once the NDA sponsor submits study reports required under the written request.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation 

38



are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA or BLA application fee. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize that the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug.
If the sponsor of a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and FDA approval of the same therapeutic candidate for the same condition or disease as our orphan-designated drug.
Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
In addition, as the FDA has interpreted the Orphan Drug Act, even if a previously approved same drug does not have unexpired orphan exclusivity, a demonstration of clinical superiority is required for a subsequent marketing application for the same orphan-designated drug for the same disease or condition to be awarded a 7-year period of orphan exclusivity upon marketing approval. In recent years, there have been multiple legal challenges to this FDA interpretation, and in August 2017, Congress amended the orphan drug provisions of the FDCA through enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 to codify FDA’s longstanding interpretation. Section 527 of the FDCA now expressly provides that if a sponsor of an orphan-designated drug that is otherwise the same as an already approved drug for the same rare disease or condition is seeking orphan exclusivity, FDA shall require such sponsor, to demonstrate that such drug is clinically superior to any already approved or licensed drug that is the same drug in order to obtain orphan drug exclusivity.
Patent term restoration and extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA less any time the applicant did not act with due diligence during the period, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date less any time the applicant did not act with due diligence during the period. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.

FDA approval and regulation of companion diagnostics
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.
If FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a PMA for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for use with eprenetapopt will utilize the PMA pathway.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee of $365,657 for most PMAs for FY 2021. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, 

40



which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
The 21st Century Cures Act
On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, became law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the PHSA to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Cures Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
Regulations outside the United States
Regulations and procedures governing approval of drug products in the EU
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of drug products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States and involves satisfactorily completing preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication, as well as the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorisation application, or MAA, and actual granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU Member States.
Clinical Trial Approval. Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, both as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the EU Member States. Under this system, an applicant must 

41



obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted.
Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational drug product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, as amended, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the EU, the new EU clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU Member States without the need for implementation into national laws. All clinical trials performed in the EU are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the new Clinical Trials Regulation is currently expected to become applicable in December 2021. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the EU Clinical Trials Information System; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies in different EU Member States; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed jointly by all EU Member States concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each EU Member State concerned; strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the EU Member State concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
Investigational product must be manufactured in accordance with the EU’s GMP requirements, including Commission Directive 2003/94/EC, as amended, and – once Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 applies – Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1569 and Commission Directive (EU) 2017/1572, both as amended.
Marketing Authorization. To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. In the case of pediatric patients, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid in all EU Member States. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan drug products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients at EU level, the centralized procedure is optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Based on a recommendation from the CHMP, the European Commission takes the final 

42



decision to grant a marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a drug product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. In exceptional cases, an applicant may also apply for a so-called rolling review, which means that data will be reviewed as they become available on a rolling basis, while development is still ongoing.
Regulatory data protection in the EU. In the EU, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic drug product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Periods of authorization and renewals. A marketing authorization is generally valid for five years and may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, on orphan drug products provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, as amended, sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the EU. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the EU Member State competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar drug product (i.e., a similar active substance) for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.

43



This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar drug product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by an EU Member State in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply).
Regulatory requirements after a marketing authorization has been obtained. In case an authorization for a drug in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of drug products. These include:

● | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed, has to be ensured.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacturing of authorized drugs, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EU’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements in the EU, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC and EU member state laws.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authorization to market companion diagnostics in the EU.
In the EU, in vitro medical devices are currently required to conform with the essential requirements of Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of IVD and its classification. The conformity assessment of medium-and high-risk IVDs require the intervention of an accredited notified body. Under Regulation (EU) 2017/746, companion diagnostics will generally be classified as Class C devices, i.e., medium-to high-risk. In addition to the intervention by a notified body, the conformity assessment may also necessitate the intervention of the EMA or competent EU Member State national authority. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EU. As from May 26, 2022, Regulation (EU) 2017/746, as amended, repeals and replaces Directive No 98/79/EC. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, a regulation is directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EU Member State laws implementing them, in all EU Member States. Regulation (EU) 2017/746, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for IVDs and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Once applicable, Regulation (EU) 2017/746 will among other things:

● | strengthen the rules on placing IVDs on the market and reinforce market surveillance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance, and safety of IVDs placed on the market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
On December 30, 2020, the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, was signed and has since been approved by the U.K. Parliament, European Council, and the European Parliament. The TCA does not contain wholesale mutual recognition of regulatory regimes for pharmaceuticals as was hoped. There is mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities, but it does not include reciprocal arrangements for the recognition of batch testing certification, in order to avoid unnecessary re-testing on importation of products. The Northern Ireland Protocol of December 2020 is an arrangement to avoid border checks on goods along the Northern Ireland/ Ireland border. This has resulted in Northern Ireland pharmaceutical products still being governed by EU laws and companies developing, manufacturing, or placing products on the market in the U.K. having to comply with dual legal requirements with some extra cost burdens. The TCA allows for future deviation from the current regulatory framework and it is not known if and/or when any deviations may occur, which may have an impact on development, manufacture, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing, and reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and healthcare providers are unlikely to use our products unless third-party payor coverage is provided and reimbursement by such payor is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other comparable government authorities. Even if our product candidates are approved, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including federal health care programs in the United States, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for, examining the medical necessity of, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic product is:

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce health care provider prescribing and/or patient utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an 

45



adequate reimbursement rate will be established. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party coverage and reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
In addition, prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by federal health care programs (such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program) or discounts and rebates requested by private payors. In addition, any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States may also impact the pricing of drugs. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to products for which the company receives marketing approval in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal health care programs is not always consistent. Further, private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies established under Medicare. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products for which we receive marketing approval.
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued an interim final rule with comment period (“IFC”) to implement a Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) Model for certain included drugs and biological products payable under Medicare Part B. Throughout its seven-year performance period, the MFN Model would gradually reduce Medicare Part B reimbursement for included products to their respective MFN price, which generally reflects the lowest price for a pharmaceutical product sold in certain economically-comparable member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The MFN Model was scheduled to commence on January 1, 2021; however, litigation challenging the MFN Model has delayed its implementation, and the future of the MFN Model is unclear. It is also unclear whether the Biden administration will implement changes to the MFN Model or rescind the IFC. Notwithstanding this, separate regulatory actions by the Biden administration, legislation passed by the new Congress, and/or actions taken by state and foreign governments could further impact the pharmaceutical and broader healthcare industries in ways that are difficult to predict but that could also materially impact our operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare reforms will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation and, accordingly, face uncertainties that might result from additional reforms.  Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from member state to member state. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe 

46



fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
Healthcare law and regulation
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, may have to comply with the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA (defined below), and may be subject to similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to these broadly applicable healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements.
The applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, without limitation, the following:

● | The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute—An intent-based federal criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The PPACA (as defined below), among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, to clarify that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. The Anti-Kickback Statute applies to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and individuals, such as prescribers, patients, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, grants, charitable contributions, and patient support offerings, among others. A conviction for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment and requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Exclusion may also be imposed if the government determines that an entity has committed acts that are prohibited by the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry practices from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn, and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor. The Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors have been the subject of recent regulatory reforms. On November 20, 2020, OIG issued two regulations finalizing significant safe harbor modifications. The first rule finalized new safe harbors and modified existing safe harbors to promote certain value-based and coordinated care arrangements and reduce regulatory burden, which became effective January 19, 2021. The second rule (the “Rebate Rule”) created new safe harbor protection for certain (i) point-of-sale discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations, and their contracted pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), and (ii) fees for certain services that PBMs provide to pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, the Rebate Rule revised the discount safe harbor to exclude from protection price reductions (e.g., rebates) for pharmaceutical products from manufacturers to Part D plans when made directly or indirectly through a PBM. Implementation of the Rebate Rule is uncertain due, at least in part, to a change in the U.S. presidential administration and ongoing litigation challenging the Rebate Rule. Specifically, the new safe harbor provisions in the Rebate Rule affecting certain point-of-sale discounts and PBM service fees have

been delayed from January 29, 2021 until March 22, 2021 pursuant to the January 20, 2021 White House memorandum, titled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review,” which directed federal agencies to take steps to facilitate the incoming Biden administration’s review of regulatory actions by the Trump administration, including delaying the effective dates of certain regulations. In addition, litigation challenging the Rebate Rule has resulted in a delay of its provisions affecting the discount safe harbor from January 1, 2022 until January 1, 2023, and the litigants have agreed to hold the case in abeyance pending a review of the Rebate Rule by the Biden administration. We cannot predict the full impact of the Rebate Rule, if implemented, and subsequent related regulatory actions on our operations. As a general matter, however, any changes to the safe harbors may impact our future contractual and other arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, group purchasing organizations, third-party payors, wholesalers and distributors, healthcare providers and prescribers, and other entities, as well as our future pricing strategies.

● | The Federal Civil False Claims Act—Imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to a federal health care program or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, currently set at $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and/or subject to government enforcement actions asserting liability under the federal civil False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes (e.g., under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program), and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. There is also the federal criminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the federal civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those that make or present a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim to the federal government.

● | The Federal Criminal Statute on False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters—Makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA Criminal Federal Health Care Fraud Statute—Enacted as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully execute, or attempt to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of any health care benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law—Authorizes the imposition of substantial civil monetary penalties against an entity, such as a pharmaceutical manufacturer, that engages in activities including, among others (1) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or that is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) arranging for or contracting with an individual or entity that is excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs to provide items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program; (3) violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or (4) failing to report and return a known overpayment.

● | HIPAA Health Information Privacy and Security—HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) imposes privacy, security, and breach reporting obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable protected health information, including, among other requirements, to implement certain policies and procedures, to support certain substantive rights of patients, mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards to protect the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act—Requires “applicable manufacturers” of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, among others, to track and report annually to the federal government (for disclosure to the public) certain payments and other transfers of value they make to “covered recipients.” The term covered recipients includes U.S.-licensed physicians, teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act—A set of laws, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analogous State and Foreign Laws—There are state and foreign law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers (i.e., so-called “all-payor anti-kickback laws”), as well as state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and, with respect to state laws, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | State and Foreign Laws Regulating Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Compliance Programs, Drug Price Transparency, and Other Practices—Some state and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation, or other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare providers. Several U.S. states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports, and/or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. Other state laws prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. In addition, several recently passed state laws require disclosures related to state agencies and/or commercial purchasers with respect to certain price increases that exceed a certain level as identified in the relevant statutes. Some of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements that government officials have not yet clarified. Given the lack of clarity in the laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect that one or more of our products, if approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, including coverage for outpatient services and supplies, such as certain drug products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, 

49



one or more of our products, if approved, may be covered and reimbursed under other federal health care programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and pay quarterly rebates based on utilization of a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs under the program as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients and in order for payment to be available for a manufacturer’s drugs under Medicare Part B. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are also required to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in order for payment to be available for a manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, a manufacturer must charge to more than the 340B “ceiling price” for its covered outpatient drugs purchased by statutorily defined covered entities that participate in the program. 
In addition, federal law requires that, in order for payment to be available for a manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it must also participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. To participate, manufacturers are required to enter into an FSS contract and other agreements with the VA for their covered drugs. Under these agreements, manufacturers must make their covered drugs available to the “Big Four” federal agencies— the VA, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service), and the Coast Guard—at pricing that is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula. The FCP is based on a weighted average non-federal average manufacturer price, which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and annual basis to the VA. Further, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers may enter into an agreement with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) under which they agree to honor “Big Four” pricing for their covered drugs when they are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE retail network pharmacies.
As part of the requirements to participate in these government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, best price, average sales price, and non-federal average manufacturer price. The calculations can be complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements, or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. Any failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations, when applicable, could negatively impact our financial results. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government, if a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of its average sales price, or if a manufacturer fails to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate a manufacturer’s Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs and may provide a basis for other potential liability under other federal laws such as the False Claims Act.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, guidance, case law or other applicable law. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations pursuant to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products, if approved, and adversely impact our financial results. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, these risks cannot be eliminated entirely. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources, and they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.

U.S. healthcare reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of our future collaborators, to effectively sell any drugs for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or our future collaborators, may receive for any approved drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as emended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, “PPACA”) has substantially changed and continues to impact healthcare financing and delivery by both government payors and private insurers. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain federal programs identified in the PPACA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of beneficiary eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program that, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, requires manufacturers to provide a now 70% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reporting of certain financial arrangements between manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices, and medical supplies and physicians and teaching hospitals under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | annual reporting of certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to licensed practitioners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The framework of the PPACA continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments that have challenged the law and contribute to legal uncertainty that could affect the profitability of our 

51



products. While Congress has not enacted legislation to comprehensively repeal the PPACA, legislation affecting the PPACA has been signed into law, including the elimination, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the PPACA’s individual mandate, without the penalty that was eliminated effective January 1, 2019, was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the PPACA. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the PPACA were also invalid. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the PPACA (i.e., whether the entire PPACA was therefore also unconstitutional). The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on March 2, 2020 and conducted oral argument in November 2020. The case is expected to be decided in 2021.
Effective January 1, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, further amended portions of the Social Security Act implemented as part of the PPACA to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the Coverage Gap Discount Program must provide to eligible Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” and to reduce standard beneficiary cost sharing in the coverage gap from 30% to 25% in most Medicare Part D plans. In addition, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, signed into law December 20, 2019, fully repealed the PPACA’s “Cadillac Tax” on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans (for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019), the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share (for calendar year 2021)
, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices 
(for sales after December 31, 2019). In the future, there may be additional challenges and/or amendments to the PPACA. It remains to be seen precisely what any new legislation will provide, when or if it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability and cost of healthcare items and services, including drug products.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in reductions in payments to Medicare providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension of the payment reduction from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to providers from three to five years. These legislative changes may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
Recently, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals has been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. Congress considered and passed legislation, and the Trump administration pursued several regulatory reforms to further increase transparency around prices and price increases, lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers, and decrease spending on prescription drugs by government programs. Congress also continued to conduct inquiries into the prescription drug industry’s pricing practices. While several proposed reform measures will require Congress to pass legislation to become effective, Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to address prescription drug costs. Since the Presidential inauguration, the Biden administration has taken several recent executive actions that signal changes in policy from the prior administration. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration directed all federal departments and agencies to consider taking steps to withdraw or delay certain regulations and guidance issued by the Trump administration that had not become effective as of January 20, 2021 to permit the Biden administration to review such actions for questions of fact, law, and policy. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and states are implementing regulations designed to control spending on and patient out-of-pocket costs for drug products. Implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms that affect the pricing and/or availability of drug products may impact our ability to generate revenue, attain or maintain profitability, or commercialize products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.

52



We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and/or new payment methodologies, and place additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians and other healthcare providers receive for administering any approved product we might bring to market. Reductions in reimbursement levels and imposition of more rigorous coverage criteria or new payment methodologies may negatively impact the prices we receive or the frequency with which our products are prescribed or administered. Any coverage or reimbursement policies instituted by Medicare or other federal health care programs may result in similar policies from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may affect our ability to generate revenue, attain or maintain profitability, or commercialize our drug candidates. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Human Capital Resources and Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 17 full-time employees, of which 11 employees are directly engaged in research and development with the rest providing administrative, business and operations support. We also utilize outside consultants and independent contractors to supplement our full-time workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resource objectives include, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain and motivate employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the prior March 31st, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, meaning that the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held

by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
