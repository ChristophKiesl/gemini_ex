Business
We are a publicly-traded company that operates our business through one reportable segment by acquiring, managing and capitalizing ground leases. We believe that our business has characteristics comparable to a high-grade, fixed income investment business, but with certain unique advantages. Relative to alternative fixed income investments generally, our ground leases typically benefit from built-in growth derived from contractual base rent increases (either at a specified percentage or consumer price index ("CPI") based, or both), and the opportunity to realize value from residual rights to take ownership of the buildings and other improvements on our land at no additional cost to us. We believe that these features offer us the opportunity to realize superior risk-adjusted total returns when compared to certain alternative highly-rated investments.
Ground leases generally represent the ownership of land underlying commercial real estate projects that is net leased on a long-term basis (base terms are typically 30 to 99 years, often with tenant renewal options) by the fee owner of the land (landlord) to the owners/operators of the real estate projects built thereon ("Ground Lease"), or what we refer to as a SafeholdTM. The property is generally leased on a triple net basis with the tenant generally responsible for taxes, maintenance and insurance as well as all operating costs and capital expenditures. Ground Leases typically provide that at the end of the lease term or upon tenant default and the termination of the Ground Lease upon such default, the land, building and all improvements revert to the landlord. We have become the industry leader in Ground Leases by demonstrating the value of the product to real estate investors, owners, operators and developers and expanding their use throughout major metropolitan areas.
We have a portfolio of properties diversified by property type and region. Our portfolio is comprised of Ground Leases and one master lease (relating to five hotel assets that we refer to as our “Park Hotels Portfolio”) that provide for contractual periodic rent escalations and in some cases percentage rent participations in gross revenues generated at the relevant properties.

We have chosen to focus on Ground Leases because we believe they meet an important need in the real estate capital markets for our customers. We also believe Ground Leases offer a unique combination of safety, income growth and the potential for capital appreciation for investors for the following reasons:
High Quality Long-Term Cash Flow: We believe that a Ground Lease represents a safe position in a property’s capital structure. The combined value of the land and buildings and improvements subject to a Ground Lease (the "Combined Property Value") typically significantly exceeds a landlord’s investment in a Ground Lease. Therefore, even if the landlord takes over the property following a tenant default or upon expiration of the Ground Lease, the landlord is reasonably likely to recover substantially all of its Ground Lease investment, and possibly amounts in excess of its investment, depending upon prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the typical structure of a Ground Lease provides the landlord with a residual right to regain possession of its land and take ownership of the buildings and improvements thereon upon a tenant default. The landlord’s residual right provides a strong incentive for a Ground Lease tenant or its leasehold lender to make the required Ground Lease rent payments.
Income Growth: Ground Leases typically provide growing income streams through contractual base rent escalators that may compound over the duration of the lease. These rent escalators may be based on fixed increases, CPI or a combination thereof, and may also include a participation in the gross revenues of the property. We believe that this growth in the lease rate over time can mitigate the effects of inflation and capture anticipated increases in land values over time, as well as serving as a basis for growing our dividend.
Opportunity for Capital Appreciation: The opportunity for capital appreciation comes in two forms. First, as the ground rent grows over time, the value of the Ground Lease should grow under market conditions in which capitalization rates remain flat. Second, our residual right to regain possession of the land underlying the Ground Lease and take title to the buildings and other improvements thereon for no additional consideration creates additional potential value to our shareholders.
We generally target Ground Lease investments in which the initial cost of the Ground Lease represents 30% to 45% of the Combined Property Value as if the Ground Lease did not exist. If the initial cost of a Ground Lease is equal to 35% of the Combined Property Value, the remaining 65% of the Combined Property Value represents potential excess value over the amount of our investment that would be turned over to us upon the reversion of the property, assuming no intervening change in the Combined Property Value. In our view, there is a strong correlation between inflation and commercial real estate values over time, which supports our belief that the value of our owned residual portfolio should increase over time as inflation increases, although our ability to recognize value in certain cases may be limited by the rights of our tenants under some of our Ground Leases, including tenant rights to purchase our land in certain circumstances and the right of one tenant to demolish improvements prior to the expiration of the lease. See "Risk Factors" for a discussion of these tenant rights.
Owned Residual Portfolio: We believe that the residual right is a unique feature distinguishing Ground Leases from other fixed income investments and property types. We refer to the value of the land and improvements subject to a Ground Lease in excess of our investment basis as unrealized capital appreciation (“UCA”). We track the UCA in the value of our owned residual portfolio over our basis because we believe it provides relevant information with regard to the three key investment characteristics of our Ground Leases: (1) the safety of our position in a tenant’s capital structure; (2) the quality of the long-term cash flows generated by our portfolio rent that increases over time; and (3) increases and decreases in the Combined Property Value of the portfolio that reverts to us pursuant to such residual rights.
We believe that, similar to a loan to value metric, tracking changes in the value of our owned residual portfolio is useful as an indicator of the quality of our cash flows and the safety of our position in a tenant’s capital structure, which, in turn, supports our objective to pay and grow dividends over time. Observing changes in our owned residual portfolio value also helps us monitor changes in the value of the real estate portfolio that reverts to us under the terms of the leases, either at the expiration or earlier termination of the lease. The value may be realized by us at the relevant time by entering into a new lease reflecting then current market terms and values, selling the building, selling the building with the land, or operating the building directly and leasing the spaces to tenants at prevailing market rates.

We have engaged an independent valuation firm to prepare: (a) initial reports of the Combined Property Value associated with our Ground Lease portfolio; and (b) periodic updates of such reports, which we use, in part, to determine the current estimated value of our owned residual portfolio. We calculate this estimated value by subtracting our original aggregate cost basis in the Ground Leases from our estimated aggregate Combined Property Value based on estimates by the valuation firm and by management.
The table below shows the current estimated UCA as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 ($ in millions):(1)

See "Risk Factors-Certain tenant rights under our Ground Leases may limit the value and the UCA we are able to realize upon lease expiration, sale of our land and Ground Leases or other events" for a discussion of certain tenant rights and other terms of the leases that may limit our ability to realize value from the UCA.

Ground Lease Cost includes our applicable percentage interests in our unconsolidated ventures and $308.2 million and $165.5 million of unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our gross book value as a percentage of Combined Property Value was 40%.

In 2018, we established the Caret program through the formation of a subsidiary called Caret Ventures LLC. The Caret program is designed to recognize the two distinct components of value in our Ground Lease portfolio by separating them into:

● | the “bond component,” which consists of the bond-like income stream we receive from contractual rent payments under its Ground Leases, plus the return of our investment basis in each asset; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the “Caret component,” which consists of the UCA above our investment basis in its Ground Leases due to our ownership of the land and improvements at the end of the term of the applicable Ground Lease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Caret Venture’s two classes of limited liability company interests are designed to track these two components: “GL units” are intended to track the bond component and “Caret units” are designed to track the Caret component (the “Caret program”). We currently hold all of the GL units indirectly through the Operating Partnership (defined below).
​
In general, all of our Ground Leases are subject to the Caret program, and holders of Caret units are generally entitled to amounts equal to the net proceeds from the disposition of a Ground Lease asset in excess of the cost borne by us to acquire such asset (including amounts paid to the tenant in connection with the initial development of improvements at the properties). However, we are entitled to deduct accrued unpaid rent under the applicable Ground Lease from the amount payable to the holders of Caret units on account of such net proceeds. 
​
During the third quarter of 2018, we adopted, and in the second quarter of 2019, our stockholders approved, the Caret Performance Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the “Plan”). The Plan is intended to encourage personnel to make attractive Ground Lease investments. Under the Plan, 1,500,000 Caret units were reserved for grants of performance-based awards to Plan participants, including certain executives of iStar Inc. (“iStar”), the parent company of SFTY Manager, LLC (our "Manager" – refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), and our directors and service providers. Grants under the Plan were subject to graduated vesting based on time-based service conditions and hurdles of our common stock price, all of which were satisfied as of December 31, 2021, except with respect to approximately 38,206 Caret units that vested on December 31, 2022. In addition, in February 2022 we granted awards that will vest upon satisfaction of continuing service conditions and as of December 31, 2022, 1,100 of these Caret units are scheduled to vest on December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, Plan participants held 1,423,056 Caret units, representing 14.93% of the then-outstanding Caret units and 14.23% of the then-authorized Caret units, which includes 735,000 Caret units, representing 7.71% of the then-outstanding Caret units and 7.35% of the then-authorized Caret units, and 337,500 Caret units, representing 3.54% of the then-outstanding Caret units and 3.38% of the then-authorized Caret units, held directly and

indirectly by Jay Sugarman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Marcos Alvarado, our President and Chief Investment Officer, respectively. 
​
In February 2022, we sold 108,571 Caret units for $19.0 million to third-party investors and received a commitment from an existing shareholder for the purchase of 28,571 Caret units for $5.0 million (refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Those 137,142 Caret units equal 1.37% of the then-authorized Caret units. As part of the sale, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide public market liquidity for the Caret units by seeking to provide a listing of the Caret units (or securities into which they may be exchanged) on a public exchange within two years of the sale. In the event market liquidity of the Caret units is not achieved within such two year period at a valuation not less than the purchase price for the Caret units purchased in February 2022, reduced by an amount equal to the amount of subsequent cash distributions made to investors on account of such Caret units, then the investors in the February 2022 transaction have the right to cause their Caret units purchased in February 2022 to be redeemed by Caret Ventures LLC at such purchase price as so reduced.
​
In August 2022, we entered into an agreement with MSD Partners who has subscribed to purchase 100,000 Caret units from us for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million conditioned on the closing of the Spin-Off and the Merger (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). MSD Partners’ obligations to purchase the Caret units are also subject to certain other conditions (refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). In November 2022, we entered into subscription agreements for an aggregate of 22,500 Caret units for an aggregate $4.5 million, or $200 per unit, with certain third-party investors. The third-party investors obligations to purchase the Caret units is contingent upon the MSD Partners’ Caret unit purchase.
​
In September 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement, as approved by our board of directors, to sell a Ground Lease in the Washington, D.C. market for $136.0 million to a third-party purchaser. The sale closed on September 29, 2022. The transaction generated a net book gain for us of approximately $46.4 million. After paying closing costs, establishing reserves for Caret-related expenses and deducting the original $76.7 million cost basis to us, the remaining proceeds have been distributed approximately 84% to us and approximately 16% to the minority holders of Caret units. In addition, MSD Partners will receive a credit against their purchase price for Caret units equal to the amount they would have received had they held Caret units at the time of the distribution.
​
Market Opportunity: We believe that there is a significant market opportunity for a dedicated provider of Ground Lease capital like us. We believe that the market for existing Ground Leases is fragmented with ownership comprised primarily of high net worth individuals, pension funds, life insurance companies, estates and endowments. However, while we intend to pursue acquisitions of existing Ground Leases, our investment thesis is predicated, in part, on what we believe is an untapped market opportunity to expand the use of Ground Leases to a broader component of the approximately $7.0 trillion institutional commercial property market in the U.S. We intend to capture this market opportunity by utilizing multiple sourcing and origination channels, including manufacturing new Ground Leases with third-party owners and developers of commercial real estate and originating Ground Leases to provide capital for development and redevelopment. We further believe that Ground Leases generally represent an attractive source of capital for our tenants and may allow them to generate superior returns on their invested equity as compared to utilizing alternative sources of capital. We draw on the extensive investment origination and sourcing platform of iStar to actively promote the benefits of the Ground Lease structure to prospective Ground Lease tenants.
We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in June 2017. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SAFE." We are managed by our Manager pursuant to a management contract. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2017. We are structured as an Umbrella Partnership REIT ("UPREIT"). As such, all of our properties are owned through a subsidiary partnership, Safehold Operating Partnership LP (the "Operating Partnership"). As of December 31, 2022, we owned 100% of the limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours owned 100% of the general partner interests in the Operating Partnership. The UPREIT structure may afford us certain benefits as we seek to acquire properties from third parties who may want to defer taxes by contributing their Ground Leases to us.

Investment Strategy
Our primary investment objective is to construct a diversified portfolio of Ground Leases that will generate attractive high-quality risk-adjusted returns and support stable and growing distributions to our shareholders. We have identified several channels for pursuing Ground Lease investment opportunities which include:

● | Create a Ground Lease with a Third Party at Acquisition or Recapitalization. We seek to pursue opportunities where a third party acquiror or existing owner of a commercial property may be interested in utilizing a Ground Lease structure to facilitate its options with respect to its interests in the property. We will create the Ground Lease by splitting ownership of the property into an ownership interest and Ground Lease on the land, and a separate leasehold interest of the building and improvements thereon. We will acquire the ownership interest and Ground Lease on the land from the third party.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Originate Ground Leases to Provide Capital For Development or Value-Add Redevelopment or Repositioning. We seek opportunities where we can purchase land and simultaneously lease it pursuant to a new Ground Lease to a tenant who plans to develop a new, or significantly improve an existing, commercial property on the land.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquire Existing Ground Leases. We seek to acquire existing Ground Leases or options to acquire existing Ground Leases that are marketed for sale and actively solicit potential sellers and related property brokers of existing Ground Leases to engage in off-market transactions. Our structure as an UPREIT gives us the ability to acquire Ground Leases from owners, particularly estates and high net worth individuals, using Operating Partnership units that may provide the seller with tax advantages, as well as liquidity, portfolio diversification and professional management.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We generally intend to target Ground Leases that meet some or all of the following investment criteria:

● | Properties of any type that are located in the top 30 metropolitan areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Properties that we believe are well located in markets with high barriers to entry and that have durable cash flow;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transaction sizes between $10 million and $500 million or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Average remaining initial lease terms that are typically 30 to 99 years;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Periodic contractual rent escalators or percentage rent participations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ground Rent Coverage, defined as the ratio of the Property’s NOI to the annualized rental payment due us, of approximately 2.0x to 4.5x. Property NOI is defined as the trailing twelve month net operating income of the building and improvements being operated at the property without giving effect to any rent paid or payable under our Ground Lease, and for this purpose we use estimates of the stabilized Property NOI if we don’t receive current tenant information and for properties under construction or in transition, in each case based on leasing activity at the property and available market information, including leasing activity at comparable properties in the relevant market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value of approximately 30% to 45% of the Combined Property Value at the commencement of the lease or the acquisition date; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | First year cash return on asset of between 2.5% and 5.0% and effective yields between 4.5% and 7.0%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financing Strategy
We utilize and expect to continue to utilize leverage. Our current strategy is to generally target overall leverage at an amount that is approximately 25% of the aggregate Combined Property Value of our portfolio, but not to exceed an overall ratio of 2:1 relative to our total equity. However, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. We anticipate that our Manager, under the supervision of our board of directors, will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or floating rate. Our board of directors may from time to time modify our leverage policies in light of the then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general market conditions for debt and equity issuances, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors, including the restrictive covenants under our debt obligations. 

5



Subject to our qualification as a REIT, we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements.
To the extent our board of directors determines to obtain additional capital, we may, without stockholder approval, borrow funds or issue debt or equity securities, including additional Operating Partnership units, retain earnings (subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs under the Code) or pursue a combination of these methods. As long as our Operating Partnership is in existence, the proceeds of all equity capital raised by us will be contributed to our Operating Partnership in exchange for additional interests in our Operating Partnership, which will dilute the ownership interests of the then existing limited partners in our Operating Partnership.
Hedging Strategy
We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. We intend to structure hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our qualification as a REIT.
Conflict of Interest Policies
Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with iStar and its affiliates, including our Manager, our executive officers and/or directors who are also officers and/or directors of iStar, and any limited partner of our Operating Partnership. Conflicts may include, without limitation: conflicts arising from the enforcement of agreements between us and iStar or our Manager; conflicts in the amount of time that officers and employees of our Manager will spend on our affairs versus iStar’s other affairs; conflicts in future transactions that we may pursue with iStar; conflicts between the interests of our stockholders and the management holders of Caret units; and conflicts in allocating investments to an iStar-managed investment fund in which we may invest. iStar is our largest shareholder and owned approximately 54.3% of our common stock as of December 31, 2022. In addition, two directors of iStar serve on our board of directors, including Jay Sugarman, who is the chief executive officer of iStar and our chief executive officer. Our Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of iStar. As a result of the foregoing relationships, iStar has significant influence over us. We have adopted a policy that all transactions between iStar (and its affiliates) and us must be approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. However, we cannot assure you this policy or other policies and provisions of law will always succeed in eliminating the influence of such conflicts. If they are not successful, decisions could be made that might fail to reflect the best interest of all shareholders. See "Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Relationship with our Manager and its Affiliates – There are various potential conflicts of interest in our relationship with iStar and its affiliates, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our shareholders."
Competition
We compete with numerous commercial developers, real estate companies (including other REITs), financial institutions (such as banks and insurance companies) and other investors (such as pension funds, investment funds, private companies and individuals) for investment opportunities and tenants. This competition may result in higher costs for properties, lower returns and impact our ability to grow. Some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to more attractive capital than we do. However, due to our focus on Ground Leases located throughout the U.S., and because some of our competitors are locally and/or regionally focused, we do not always encounter the same competitors in each market.
Regulation
We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has enabled us to maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and we intend to continue to do so. In addition, our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations. Our tenants are generally responsible under our Ground Leases for taxes, maintenance and insurance as well as all operating costs and capital expenditures, including capital expenditures that may result from compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations. Although our tenants are primarily responsible for any damages and claims arising from the leased properties’ compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations, a tenant’s 

6



bankruptcy or inability to satisfy its obligations for these types of damages or claims could require us to satisfy such liabilities. In addition, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease.
Code of Conduct
The Company has adopted a code of conduct that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our directors, officers, Manager and employees of our Manager who perform services for us (the "Code of Conduct"). The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Conduct has been provided to each of our directors, officers, the Manager and relevant employees, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Conduct. A copy of the Company’s Code of Conduct has been previously filed with the SEC and is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 14.1. The Code of Conduct is also available on the Company’s website at www.safeholdinc.com. The Company will disclose on its website material changes to its Code of Conduct, or any waivers for directors or executive officers, if any, within four business days of any such event. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no amendments to the Code of Conduct and the Company has not granted any waivers from any provision of the Code of Conduct to any directors or executive officers.
Human Capital Resources
We have no employees and rely on our Manager for our human capital resources. Our management agreement requires that our Manager provide us with an executive management team and other appropriate support personnel to manage our business in accordance with the agreement. Our Manager is responsible for directly compensating and providing benefits to its employees who provide services to us, although we have granted equity compensation in the form of Caret units and other stock-based awards to members of senior management and other iStar employees and expect to do so in the future. Our Manager has advised us that it had 118 employees as of December 31, 2022 compared to 143 employees as of December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our Manager’s employees are full time employees.
Our Manager has publicly announced that scaling our business is one of its principal business strategies and that it has devoted substantial additional personnel and other resources to these efforts beginning in early 2019 when we and iStar announced an expansion of our relationship. In March 2022, iStar sold its net lease portfolio and in August 2022, we and iStar announced that we entered into a merger agreement that provides, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, that we will merge with and into iStar (the “Merger”). The aforementioned transactions have and may continue to reduce the number of iStar employees.
Our Manager has reported that in its recruiting efforts, our Manager generally strives to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for roles. In addition, our Manager has reported that it maintains a variety of development, health and wellness and charitable programs for its personnel, including those who provide services to us.
