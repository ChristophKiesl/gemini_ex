General
 
BorrowMoney.com, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on January 27, 2000, originally known as Sports.com, Inc. Since its inception and up until May 4, 2015, the Company has undergone several name changes, the last being BorrowMoney.com, Inc. On May 4, 2015, the Company became BorrowMoney.com, Inc. Simultaneously, it completed a share exchange with all of the shareholders of BorrowMoney.com, Inc., a New York corporation where 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of the New York Corporation were exchanged for shares in the Florida Corporation which resulted in Borrowmoney.com, Inc., the New York Corporation becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Florida Corporation.
 
BorrowMoney.com, Inc.’s business objective is to provide a service for the internet mortgage and loan provider business. BorrowMoney.com, Inc.’s business model envisions providing current, qualified leads to local lending institutions who are currently members of the National Mortgage Listing Service. These leads will represent qualified borrowers in targeted zip code locations where the lender conducts business. Our internet platform offers a portal geared toward providing services to lending institutions who would be our customers. The key function of our platform is to provide qualified leads to local mortgage and lending professionals. The Company also sell advertising space on its website and creates revenue through the sale of advertisement space, membership fees and lead packages.
 
Through our proprietary platform, we provide institutional lenders with a digital solution by offering technologically gathered leads. The key function of our platform is to provide qualified leads to local mortgage and lending professionals. The Company expects to monetize the customer inquiries through the use of various advertising methods.
 
Products and Services
 
The Company has created an Internet-based loan marketplace for consumers and our customers, which are lenders. Our technology is now operational and we are able to collect consumer credit requests and compare those requests and related credit information for submission to lenders which have joined our technology platform. We are not a lender. We currently can intake consumer applications and inquiries for submission to participating lenders who receive consumer credit requests that are received online from consumers. We currently have no revenues from lenders and must have additional lenders join our marketplace to generate significant revenues. As more lenders join our network within a consumer’s geographic areas within the United States, consumers will receive up to three (3) offers in response to a single credit request and then be able to compare, review, and accept the offer that best suits their needs. Lenders can generate new business that meets their specific underwriting criteria at a cost that is lower than the costs associated with off-line loan originations. Our marketplace encompasses most consumer credit categories, including mortgages, home equity loans, automobile loans, and personal loans. We have an additional category for submissions to lenders for business loans. We recently added capabilities to our technology and proprietary Internet platform which allows a consumer to find a realtor within the geographic area that the consumer is attempting to either purchase or sell real property.
 
We are not a lender; instead, we attract consumers to our Website through various forms of advertising and send their loan requests to subscribed lenders and loan brokers (“Lenders”) participating on our exchange. Our technology platform is the technology that powers our Internet based lending exchange at www.borrowmoney.com.
 
Consumers begin the Borrowmoney.com process by completing a simple on-line credit request (which we refer to as a “qualification form”). After the consumer completes the qualification form, the consumers’ data is automatically compared to the underwriting criteria of the subscribed Lenders participating on our lending exchange. Qualified consumers can receive multiple loan offers on-line in response to a single credit request and then compare, review, and accept the offer that best suits their needs. Lenders can generate new business that meets their specific underwriting criteria at a lower cost of acquisition than traditional marketing channels. Our lending exchange encompasses most consumer credit categories, including mortgages, home equity loans, automobile loans, credit cards, and personal loans. Additionally, through our Website we also provide access to other realty services related to owning, maintaining and buying and selling a home, including a network of real estate brokers.

We intend to earn revenue from the Lenders on our exchange which pay us fees (“Transmission Fees”) for qualification forms that meet their underwriting criteria and are transmitted to them. Since a qualification form can be transmitted to more than one Lender, we may generate multiple Transmission Fees for the same form. We also intend to earn revenue for loans that the Lenders on our exchange close with consumers that we referred to them (“Closed-Loan Fees”). We refer to the aggregate of these fees as our Exchanged revenue.
 
Industry Background
 
For Lenders, the traditional loan origination process is paper-intensive, time-consuming, and usually accompanied by high fixed costs and labor expense. This inefficient process often involves significant marketing and origination costs.
 
For consumers, the traditional loan process is time-consuming, requires completion of multiple forms, and can often be frustrating and confusing. Consumers typically search through a variety of loan products from many different lenders, apply to one lender at a time for that lender’s offered terms, and then wait for that lender to approve or reject the application. Competing online lending sites generally mirror the traditional loan origination process. Consumers can visit our Website, view a list of loan products, apply for one product from a lender, and are either given an offer or rate quote or are rejected by the lender. While the consumer proposition presented by online lending websites is the same as the traditional offline process, the business models for online lending websites generally fall into the following two categories:
 
Lender/Broker Model.
 
The operators of websites such as Mortgagebot.com, QuickenLoans, and Ditech generate a large portion of revenue in the same way as traditional lenders, from a mark-up over their cost of capital, whether the source of capital is a lender, secondary market purchaser, or warehouse line of credit. In exchange for these mark-ups, the lender/broker undertakes all of the document processing, verification, and customer interaction. In addition, to the extent the lenders/brokers fund originated loans with their own capital, they are often directly exposed to interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and must also effectively manage their loan pipeline.
 
Referral Agent Model.
 
The operators of websites such as Providian’s GetSmart typically generate revenue by providing referrals to lenders. Because referral agents typically do not generate any revenue upon loan closings, there is little incentive for these companies to ensure that lenders and consumers consummate the loan transaction. Additionally, because referral websites do not offer the consumers multiple offers on their sites, they are not able to continually give best practices and pricing data to lender participants.
 
Borrowmoney.com believes that the inefficiencies of the traditional lending process and the shortcomings of other online business models, combined with the large and recurring nature of consumer loan demand, offer a substantial opportunity for its lead processing business model.

The Borrowmoney.com Process
 
Our process consists of the following steps:
 
Credit Request. Consumers access our exchange at www.BorrowMoney.com and select a loan product from our multiple loan categories. Consumers complete a single qualification form for the selected loan product with information such as income, assets and liabilities, loan preferences and other data. Consumers also consent to our retrieval of their credit report.
Qualification Form Filtering and Transmission.
 
Our filtering process matches the consumer’s qualification form data, credit profile, and geographic location to the preset underwriting criteria provided by participating Lenders. Lenders are able to modify their underwriting criteria in real-time directly through a password-protected Website upon our proprietary platform. Once qualification forms pass the filters, they are transmitted to up to three Lenders who have subscribed to our marketplace whose lending criteria match that of the consumers’ profile and location.
Lender Evaluation and Response.
 
Lenders evaluate and respond to the qualification forms that pass their filters. This response takes place on the automated interface technology that we have developed.
 
Communication of Offer.
 
Once a Lender evaluates a qualification form, renders a decision, and responds with an offer, our system automatically notifies the consumer via e-mail and displays the offers on the Website where the request originated. The e-mail contains instructions to return to our Website and provides instructions directing the consumer to the “Check Status” page where consumers can view and compare the terms of each offer including: interest rate, closing costs, monthly payment amount, lender fees and other information.
Offer Acceptance.
 
The consumer has the ability to accept, reject or request more information about any particular loan offer. When the consumer selects one of these options, our system automatically notifies the chosen Lender and the remainder of the process is conducted offline.
Other Services
 
Real Estate Services
 
We intend to refer consumers from our exchange or various third party sites to participants in our network of real estate agents located in most states. As of August 31, 2017, we had relationships with approximately 700 real estate brokerages or agents to support referrals supplied by us. These relationships involved real estate brokerages or agents testing their personal profiles with our website. Currently, nearly all of these real estate brokerages or agents that have submitted profiles are on a trial basis and are not being charged. Several have elected to pay the annual membership fee currently established at $150.00. If the real estate brokerage or agent elected to become a member by paying the annual membership fee, they will receive real estate sales and testing services without additional charge. For non-members, we offer nationwide real estate sales and rental listing services at a current monthly charge of $25 per listing, along with quarterly or annual listing service packages.
Advertising and Banner Services
 
Borrowmoney.com offers various advertising services which are displayed on the Website. Advertising prices on our Website are based on several industry methods as described below.

Borrowmoney’s advertising rates are based on either a pay-per-click basis, ad display basis, or on a flat rate basis. Pay-per-click and ad display advertisers are only charged when a prospective customer visits our Website and the ad is displayed or clicked on the viewing page by the person presently on the site. Advertising charges per ad exposures begin at a minimum of 10,000 clicks with a charge of .24 cents per click and an exposure charge of .02 cents.

The Company offers more than just placement of ads on its Website. We offer design services to our customers. Charges are based upon the type of ad requested as well as a fixed per hour cost for design services.
 
Lender Services
 
Borrowmoney.com intends to provide through its proprietary technology a system for lenders to electronically join the system as a subscribed lender providing quotes after final approval by a borrowmoney.com. To become a subscribed lender, a representative of the Company first logs into www.borrowmoney.com. There a potential lender will provide basic account information, contact information, lender information regarding licensing, loans loan types, such as automobile loans, real estate loans, commercial loans, personal loans, construction loans, and others, for electronic submittal to borrowmoney.com. At this same time, the lender will submit their pricing package, which is initially established as a no-cost trial period, and a monthly marketing budget, if they so choose. Upon receipt of the lender registration, we verify the information and contact the lender for final negotiations regarding the pricing packages selected.
 
Based on the package amount selected by the Lender, we negotiate the demographic where the Lender selects to run the campaign, and return on investment expected by the Lender. Borrowmoney will charge the Lender a flat fee or a percentage of the loan amount requested by a customer lead referred to the Lender. Currently we have signed up and partnered with Capital One, National Association, SecurityNational Mortgage Company, and Apollo Capital Corp.
