Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Company Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2010 and are a majority-owned subsidiary of Cellectis. We are a technology company focused on delivering plant-based innovations and solutions with substantial disruption potential across multiple industries. We are a leader in gene editing with exclusive access to proprietary TALEN® and other technologies for use in plants, which we used to successfully commercialize the first gene edited food product in the United States. We have a robust development pipeline that spans multiple crops and that is focused on several important trends including consumer health and sustainability. 
 
We are pursuing projects in large addressable markets including oats, hemp, and soybeans. We expect to commence additional projects in our areas of focus based on additional technological advancements we make, and researched ideas generated by our newly formed Scientific Advisory Board. We expect to use a variety of technologies to develop these product candidates.
 
Using our proprietary technologies and expertise, including TALEN gene editing technology exclusively licensed to us in the field of agriculture, we develop crops with targeted traits quickly and more cost effectively than through traditional methods. Our technologies enable precise cuts to DNA in a single plant cell, and then the plant’s natural repair mechanism occurs resulting in the edited plant. We then regenerate the edited single cell into a full plant. We believe that we can assess the viability of a trait in less than two years by utilizing these proprietary technologies.
 
Our capital-efficient business model comprises three differentiated go-to-market strategies. Specific deal structure and the amount and timing of cash flows and revenues will vary depending upon several factors, including cost to develop, size of the opportunity, and the stage at which a partner or licensee enters the development process. Summaries of potential revenues and cash flows of our go-to-market strategies are as follows:
 
 
• | Trait Development and Licensing Arrangements: Through development and licensing agreements with downstream partners with respect to traits we develop in exchange for negotiated upfront, milestone or annual payments and potential royalties upon the licensees’ commercial sale of products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seed Sale Arrangements: Through purchase agreements for traited seed we have produced.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology Licensing Arrangements: Through technology licensing agreements with third parties in exchange for negotiated upfront and annual payments, and potential royalties upon the licensees’ commercial sale of products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For technology licensing and trait and product development and licensing arrangements, we expect that our customers will primarily be seed companies, biotechnology companies, germplasm providers, large agricultural processors, others in the relevant crop’s supply chain, and growers, who would, in each case, utilize our technology for their own trait development in specified crops. For seed sale arrangements, we expect that our customers will be seed retailers and large agribusiness companies, including millers and crushers, or others in the relevant crop’s supply chain, with developed agronomy infrastructure and commercialization expertise. Across each of these go-to-market strategies, we will seek to develop relationships with strategic customers where our product candidates are most likely to benefit from the counterparty’s deep agronomy, product management, and commercialization expertise. Placing our products and traits with such strategic customers will reduce our expenses and downstream risk exposure, while allowing us to pursue diversified growth across multiple revenue streams.
 
We believe that our streamlined business model with differentiated go-to-market strategies provides a capital-efficient, lower-cost, and highly scalable approach. Our strategy is based on focusing on our core strengths in research and development, including gene editing, plant breeding, and trait development. We will continue to focus on advancing our technologies toward developing high value innovations and plant-based solutions with substantial disruption potential, while leveraging our partners and licensees to manage commercialization and the associated costs and risks. We believe that focusing our efforts on our technology and trait development expertise, while contracting with commercialization partners or licensees for downstream execution strikes a balance where we are best positioned for cost-efficient paths to market.
 
In late February 2019, we commercialized our high oleic soybean oil and meal products and began generating revenue from their sale. In August 2020, as part of the broader transition of our business model, we announced a change in the go-to-market strategy for these products and as a result are no longer marketing high oleic soybean oil or meal and instead will sell the underlying grain throughout 2021. We restructured our personnel to support the execution of our streamlined business model, including staffing adjustments related 
 4


to soybean processing and product sales. We have contracted to sell all of the grain from the 2020 crop at prices to be determined on the basis of agricultural commodity market prices in effect at the time our planned deliveries of grain are agreed upon, with the purchaser responsible for crushing the grain and marketing and selling the resulting oil and meal. In 2021 we expect to move this product to the seed sales go-to-market strategy, where we will sell seed outright to processors who will contract acres with growers and purchase the resulting grain produced. We will recognize revenue on the sale of seed. 
 
We are currently exploring product and partnership opportunities in various crops for potential applications across a range of industries, including food, nutraceutical, energy, and agriculture. Applying our streamlined business model with differentiated go-to-market strategies, we are well positioned to nimbly develop plant-based input solutions for specific downstream issues, including consumer preferences, sustainability, cost, quality, and regulatory compliance. As of the date of this report, we have nine projects at Phase 1 or later in our development process across alfalfa, hemp, oats, soybeans, and wheat.
 
Our current seed product line is focused on the United States. This may expand over time to other geographies, as we opportunistically pursue business arrangements that bring seed innovations developed for the United States to new territories.  We will also pursue trait development and licensing as well as technology licensing opportunities globally. Any such potential geographic expansion will be subject to customer demand and regulatory requirements, among other factors. 
 
Market and Industry Overview
 
Our focus on output trait development activity strategically positions us to take advantage of market trends toward healthy and sustainable innovation that we expect to drive demand for our development expertise.
 
Our near-term focus is on products in these areas: 
 
 
• | functional nutrition, which is in high demand as consumers look for healthier ingredients in their food;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regenerative agricultural practices, which are being utilized to benefit soil health and the environment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sustainability, which has gained momentum as stakeholders increasingly pursue practices that can contribute to combatting climate change, including by focusing on soil health, water management, and fertilizer usage;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | plant-based protein, which is increasingly becoming a staple on menus and commanding premium shelf space in supermarkets, with consumer demand for the health and sustainability benefits of non-animal sourced proteins expected to continue to grow; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | animal nutrition, which is important across agriculture given the impact it has on the environment, as well as from a consumer perspective, for pet food that delivers nutritional benefits with better and higher performing ingredients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate our technology licensing activities to span a broad range of potential crop development markets.
 
Our Technology
 
Our proprietary technologies and intellectual property portfolio are focused on TALEN, CRISPR, and other adjacent technologies, data analytics, plant breeding, systems, and work processes. Our suite of technologies enable us to edit the plant genome by knocking out genes or making precise gene edits. We take advantage of our knowledge about plant gene function to identify and select beneficial genetic variation that results in traits of value. A key difference between our current gene edited trait product portfolio and transgenic organisms is that a transgenic product contains foreign DNA whereas our products contain no foreign DNA. 
 
Our gene editing platform relies on our capacity to custom design DNA-sequence specific cutting enzymes (nucleases) for a chosen gene and our capability to enable such custom-made nucleases to make a desired edit into the living plant cells we want to edit. Our platform also relies on precisely chosen binding elements that can specifically recognize unique DNA sequences and can be tailored to target such sequences in a chosen gene or genetic region. 
 
We use transcription activator-like effector nucleases, or TALEN, as the foundation of our gene editing platform. TALEN first recognizes a specific DNA sequence and then precisely induces a controlled DNA double-strand break. A DNA double-strand break is the key to unlocking gene editing. The removal of nucleotides (through non-homologous end-joining) can result in gene inactivation or a gene knock-out. If a DNA fragment from a different region of the genome with a similar sequence to the TALEN binding site is provided at the time of the DNA break, then the DNA fragment can be moved or copied into the targeted region of the plant genome to repair a broken gene (through homologous recombination). We are currently focused on using gene knockouts and gene repair to develop new traits, which result in products containing no foreign DNA.

Key Advantages of Calyxt’s Technology Platform
 
 
• | Precision—We are able to design single or multiple TALEN to edit at any selected gene or set of genes within the plant’s genome.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiency—A large percentage of cells treated by TALEN bear the desired gene edit. Because of this efficiency, only a handful of plants must be regenerated to recover those with edits in the target gene. This efficiency drives down development cost. Recently published research from the University of Illinois1 demonstrates TALEN gene editing is more efficient than CRISPR-Cas9 in compact DNA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost—We have successfully edited genes in several plant species and can generate thousands of TALEN per week. When combined with the efficiency benefits of TALEN and streamlined regulatory requirements, we believe our platform is very cost effective compared to others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Speed-to-Market—We have a strong intellectual property position with respect to TALEN technology, its use to develop product candidates, and proven regulatory expertise in bringing these products to market, which enables our development cycle to commercial planting availability to be as fast as five to six years, including assessing the viability of a trait in as little as two years.

We are actively involved in the prosecution and protection of our key technology, which globally includes approximately 80 patent families comprised of approximately 300 patents and over 100 patent applications. Of those patents, approximately 40 have been issued in the United States, with the remaining issued in key geographies outside the U.S., primarily Europe, Japan, and China. This number also includes European patents validated in individual European countries. Of those patent applications, approximately 30 are pending in the United States, with the remaining pending as international applications or country-specific applications in key geographies outside the U.S. 
 
Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The issued patents that we have in-licensed will expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2037. If patents are issued on the pending patent applications owned by us or that we have in-licensed, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2040. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
License Agreement with Cellectis
 
Through our license agreement with Cellectis, we have access to intellectual property that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using “chimeric restriction endonucleases,” which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases. We believe this umbrella intellectual property applies broadly across gene editing in plants and makes us a key player in the gene editing intellectual property space.
 
Under our license agreement with Cellectis, we have exclusive sublicense rights (subject to existing non-exclusive sublicenses to third parties) to intellectual property exclusively licensed to Cellectis from the University of Minnesota in the field of researching, developing, and commercializing agricultural and food products, including traits, seeds, and feed and food ingredients (excluding any application in connection with animals or animal cells). These patent applications cover the use of DNA replicons for gene editing.

We have also been granted a non-exclusive license to use the TALEN trademark in connection with our use of licensed products under the agreement. Any improvements we make to the in-licensed intellectual property are owned by us and licensed back to Cellectis on an exclusive basis for any use outside of our exclusive agricultural field of use. The exclusivity of our license agreement with Cellectis is subject to certain non-exclusive licenses Cellectis granted to third parties in the field of research.
 
In consideration for the license from Cellectis, we are required to pay to Cellectis, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, a royalty of three percent of net sales less certain items as defined, including costs for grain and seed of any products that are covered by the patents licensed from Cellectis. In addition, we are required to pay Cellectis 30 percent of revenue we receive for sublicensing our rights under the agreement to third parties. Our payment obligations to Cellectis will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patents licensed to us by Cellectis.
 
Under our license agreement with Cellectis, and as between the parties, Cellectis has the first right to control the prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of the licensed intellectual property and we will have the right to step in and assume such control with respect to the patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement if Cellectis elects to not prosecute, maintain, defend, or enforce such patents. In certain circumstances, if Cellectis elects to abandon any patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement, we have the right to assume ownership of such patents. In addition, some of the intellectual property that is licensed to us by Cellectis consists of a sublicense of intellectual property originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota. Our license from Cellectis is subject to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis and should our activities under such sublicense violate the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, we are responsible for any related damages that Cellectis may incur. In addition, we are required to reimburse Cellectis for any payments made by Cellectis to the University of Minnesota pursuant to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis to the extent that such payments are required to be made as a result of our applicable activities. Under the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed intellectual property.
 
Our license agreement with Cellectis is perpetual. However, it may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written agreement of both parties, either party’s uncured material breach of the agreement, or upon certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events.
 
License Agreement between Cellectis and Regents of the University of Minnesota—TALEN
 
In January 2011, Cellectis entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota, which was amended in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Cellectis and its affiliates were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Minnesota, to make, use, sell, import, and otherwise dispose of products covered by the licensed patents, in all fields of use. These licensed patents relate to TALEN molecules and their use in gene editing.
 
Pursuant to the agreement, with respect to the agricultural field, Cellectis is required to pay to the University of Minnesota a yearly fee, as well as a commercialization fee for every seed variety containing new traits developed using the licensed technology. Cellectis is also required to pay the University of Minnesota milestone payments based on the net sales of licensed products in the agricultural field. Cellectis must also pay the University of Minnesota certain patent-related expenses for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents; and under our license agreement with Cellectis, we are obligated to reimburse Cellectis for these prosecution costs.
 
The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement upon advance written notice in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Cellectis, and immediately upon written notice if Cellectis challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Cellectis and the University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other party’s breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach.

License Agreement between Calyxt and Regents of the University of Minnesota—CRISPR
 
In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive license with the University of Minnesota, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under a specified patent application and any patents that issue therefrom owned by the University of Minnesota relating to the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to make use, and commercialize products covered by the licensed patents in any field of use. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology and to manufacture, offer to sell, and sell licensed products as soon as practicable and to maximize sales. We must also achieve certain sales- and patent-related milestones.
 
Per the terms of the agreement, we paid the University of Minnesota an upfront license fee. We are also required to pay an annual fee, patent-related expenses for prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents, and a percentage of any revenues received by us under sublicenses. If we undergo a change of control and wish to assign all our rights and duties under the agreement, we must pay the University of Minnesota a specified transfer fee.
 
Unless earlier terminated under the terms of the agreement, the agreement will continue in effect until no licensed patent is active and until no licensed patent application is pending. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement for our uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice, or 60 days’ prior written notice if the breach relates to our payment obligations under the agreement. The University of Minnesota may also terminate the agreement, upon 10 days’ prior written notice, if we file for bankruptcy or become insolvent. The University of Minnesota may also immediately terminate the agreement if we or our agents or representatives commences or maintains an action in any court or before any governmental agency asserting or alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement for The University of Minnesota’s uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice. We may also terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice.
 
Trademarks
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have four issued trademarks in the United States.
 
High Oleic Soybean 
 
We developed a soybean trait that produces oil with a fatty acid profile that contains 80 percent oleic acid, 20 percent less saturated fatty acids compared to commodity soybean oil and zero grams of trans fat per serving.
 
Prior to adopting our current go-to-market strategies, our high oleic soybean seed was sold either directly by us or through distributors to farmers, and we then purchased and processed the resulting grain and sold the resulting oil and meal products. In late February 2019, we commenced commercial sales and began generating revenue.
 
In August 2020, as part of the broader transition of our business model, we announced a change in the go-to-market strategy for these products and as a result are no longer marketing high oleic soybean oil or meal, and instead will sell the underlying grain throughout 2021. We are still obligated to purchase seed and grain pursuant to our 2020 grower contracts. We have contracted to sell all of the grain from the 2020 crop at prices to be determined on the basis of agricultural commodity market prices in effect at the time our planned deliveries of grain are agreed upon. During 2020, we also successfully exited most of the toll-based contracts associated with the operation of our identity-preserved supply chain.
 
With the adoption of our streamlined business model, in 2021, we expect to move this product to the seed sales go-to-market strategy, where we will sell seed outright to processors who will contract acres with growers and purchase the resulting grain produced. We will recognize revenue on the sale of seeds.
 
Our high oleic soybean seed sales are targeted directly to soybean processors, who will contract for acres directly with growers and will drive demand for the seed. In addition to its favorable fatty acid profile, oil produced from our high oleic soybean also has desirable characteristics that we believe will make our soybean seed attractive.
 
The high level of oleic acid in oil produced from our high oleic soybean enhances oxidative stability compared to other premium and commodity oils. This eliminates the need for partial hydrogenation, and thus little to no trans fats are produced during oil production. Furthermore, oil produced from our high oleic soybean offers up to a threefold increase in fry-life and reduced polymerization upon frying at high temperatures. The oil produced from our high oleic soybean is also neutral in flavor, odorless and colorless, which are desirable features in the food ingredient market as a result of the limited impact on the sensory characteristics of the final food product. 
 9


Oil produced from our high oleic soybean has also found applicability in markets outside of food, including the industrial lubricant market, where its characteristics enable it to act as an attractive alternative to other plant-based oils or fossil-fuel based lubricants.
 
For our high oleic soybean, we introduced a single variety in the northern United States in 2017, which was designed to grow well in parts of South Dakota and Minnesota and remained our only variety in the market during 2018 and 2019. We contracted more than 17,000 acres in 2018 and more than 36,000 acres in 2019. 
 
For the 2020 planting season, we sought to increase acreage and diversify weather risk, and launched five new soybean seed varieties, which expanded our maturity groups and expanded our growing regions to include South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska—the states in which over 45 percent of the total United States soybean acres are grown. Because of weather and other factors, we planted approximately 72,000 acres in 2020, short of our initial goal of 100,000 acres contracted. We intend to support broader geographical coverage with the launch of new soybean varieties in 2021 and 2022.
 
Through our streamlined model, we expect to recognize revenue and see the benefits of positive gross margin when we sell seed, unlike under our legacy approach where those amounts were recorded as a reduction of the purchase price of purchased grain.
 
Our Product Pipeline
 
We identify product concepts from our own research and inbound interest from potential collaborators. We continue to refine our trait portfolio and seek to take advantage of the largest market opportunities. We categorize our stages of development, all of which are pre-commercial, as follows:

• | Discovery, where we identify genes of interest or make initial development crosses between favorable breeding lines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1, where we conduct our gene editing and or produce our initial breeding stock with desired traits, produce the initial seed for testing, and voluntarily consult with applicable regulatory authorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2, where we perform validation testing and currently voluntarily consult with applicable regulatory authorities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3, where we or our collaborator develops the first commercial-scale pilot production and performs final testing prior to commercialization.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of nine product candidates in our development pipeline at Phase 1 or later, comprised of two product candidates in Phase 3, two product candidates in Phase 2, and five product candidates in Phase 1. Our target is for at least five product candidates to be available for commercial planting from now through 2024, including our improved digestibility alfalfa product in 2021, our high fiber wheat product candidate as early as 2023, and three additional product candidates thereafter.
 
Our December 31, 2020 pipeline gives effect to a prioritization process, which halted development on several legacy, pre-IPO project concepts that no longer aligned with our strategy. 
 
A summary of our pipeline at December 31, 2020 is as follows:
 
 
CROP | DEVELOPMENT PHASE | TRAIT1 | TARGET COMMERCIAL PLANTING YEAR | TARGET GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY
--------+-------------------+------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------
Alfalfa | Phase 3 | Improved Digestibility | 2021 | Trait 
Wheat | Phase 3 | High Fiber | 2023 | Trait 
Soybean | Phase 2 | High Oleic, Low Linolenic (HOLL) | 2023 | Seed 
Hemp | Phase 1 | Marketable Yield | 2023 | Seed or Trait 
Hemp | Phase 1 | Low THC for Food, Fiber, & Nutraceutical | 2024 | Seed or Trait 
Oat | Phase 1 | Winter (Cold Tolerant) | 2026 | Seed or Trait 
Soybean | Phase 2 | Improved HOLL | 2026 | Seed or Trait 
Soybean | Phase 1 | High Saturated Fat | 2026 | Seed or Trait 
Soybean | Phase 1 | Enhanced Protein Flavor | 2027 | Trait 

 
1 The agronomic and functional quality of our product candidates and the timing of development are subject to a variety of factors and risks, which are described in this annual report under the caption “Risk Factors.”.

We are also actively negotiating agreements with potential partners with respect to specific opportunities for which development activity would only commence upon reaching a commercial agreement. These projects are not included in the preceding table and would only be reported if we reach a development agreement with a partner.
 
Improved Digestibility Alfalfa
 
Alfalfa is a key feedstock in the production of milk from dairy cattle. The dairy industry is a significant producer of greenhouse gas and user of water. Dairy herds also produce substantial amounts of solid waste. Our alfalfa is designed to enable dairy producers to reduce their footprint in all three areas. We developed an alfalfa trait that has reduced lignin content in the stem of the plant, enabling it to be more digestible by livestock. Because the alfalfa is more digestible, fewer cows are needed to produce the same quantity of milk, potentially reducing the aggregate amount of water consumed and waste produced. 
 
We developed our improved quality alfalfa in collaboration with S&W Seed Company (S&W) and have granted S&W an exclusive license for improved quality alfalfa seed in the United States and several geographies outside the United States excluding the European Union, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Russia, and India. The new alfalfa seed will be sold as part of the S&W seed portfolio and branded IQ™ Alfalfa (IQA). This marks our first commercial trait license agreement. We expect the commercial product to launch in 2021 following the completion of field trials, testing and any voluntary regulatory consultations. 
 
High Fiber Wheat
 
Fiber is the indigestible portion of food that is essential for healthy digestion. Research has shown that fiber plays an important role in maintaining digestive health, lowering cholesterol, stabilizing blood glucose levels, and controlling weight gain. In recent years, the awareness of the health benefits of high fiber diets has increased. This has translated to a strong growth in demand for high fiber food products.
 
We are developing our high fiber wheat product candidate, which could be used to produce white flour with up to three times more dietary fiber than standard white flour while maintaining the same flavor and convenience of use. In March 2018 we received confirmation from USDA that our high fiber wheat is deemed non-regulated pursuant to APHIS’s regulatory procedures. We began planting high fiber wheat in field trials in 2018 and continued testing in 2019 and 2020. 
 
During the first quarter of 2020, we were notified that a significant portion of our high fiber wheat plants were damaged in field trials due to improper aerial chemical applications by unaffiliated third parties. While we are continuing to assess the impact of this damage on the overall development process and timeline for this product candidate, it has delayed our development by at least one year. This product candidate is currently in Phase 3 of our development pipeline. Our Phase 3 development activities in 2021 will include testing the product concept in field conditions, completing food application studies, and voluntarily consulting with FDA. Given the damage to our field trials described above, the timeline for the trait to be available for a commercial launch is uncertain, but not expected before 2023. In line with our strategic advancement of the business model in high oleic soybeans, we plan to introduce our high fiber wheat innovation as a licensed trait through leading wheat ingredient companies.
 
High Oleic, Low Linolenic (HOLL) Soybean and Improved Oil Soybean
 
Our HOLL soybean is our second-generation high oleic product candidate. Food processors desire an oil that delivers higher performance with an improved nutritional profile, ideally one that offers flexibility for blending for flavor specifications. This second-generation soybean product candidate will have the same high oleic content of our first-generation high oleic trait product with the additional benefit of an ultra-low linolenic acid content, which improves the flavor and blending performance. This project also includes our third-generation soybean product candidate, an HOLL soybean with a higher oil content, intended to drive improved economics through incremental crush margin to the processor.
 
These products are currently in Phase 2 of our development pipeline with targeted availability for commercial plantings in 2023 and 2026, respectively.
 
Winter Oats
 
Our trait concept could potentially support the growth of high-quality oats to meet increasing consumer food and feed demands. Our goal is to develop a winter-grown version of oats for food and feed consumption that could also be used as a winter cover crop, with the potential to improve direct-to-consumer farmgate revenue for winter cover crop farmers and generate carbon credits for farmers. Oat is America’s second-largest plant-based dairy product, and oat protein is positioned for inclusion in the burgeoning plant-based protein 
 11


market. We believe our oat project could support climate resilience, making oats more competitive economically and able to be grown in new regions of the continent, and over the longer term, in additional regions of the world.

This project, which is expected to deliver sustainability benefits once commercialized, is in Phase 1 of our development pipeline with targeted availability for commercial planting in 2026.
 
Hemp, including Marketable Yield and Low THC for Food, Fiber, and Nutraceuticals
 
Our projects in hemp target the protein, nutraceutical, fiber, and advanced materials markets. Our first efforts are focused on standardizing the crop for broad acre adoption, reduced risk hemp production, and modernizing the breeding process. We anticipate that our hemp innovations will initially come to market as licensed seed, breeding platform tools or traits, and commercialized by leading germplasm and hemp-based ingredient and material companies.  
 
This product is in Phase 1 of our development pipeline with targeted availability for commercial planting in 2024.
 
High Saturated Fat Soybeans as an Alternative to Palm Oil
 
High saturated fat soybeans is another trait we have in development, which could potentially be used as a U.S.-grown alternative to palm oil. There are significant sustainability and supply chain reliability challenges with palm oil, certain of which we believe could be overcome with this prospective oil alternative. We believe our innovation can be a replacement for palm oil which is today used as a food ingredient, in frying, in cosmetics and personal goods, in animal feed, and as an industrial ingredient. We intend to optimize the saturated to unsaturated fat ratio, which gives soy a palm oil-like quality while maintaining agronomics and yield as well as delivering taste and performance improvements. 
 
The current project is in Phase 1 of our development pipeline with targeted availability for commercial planting of 2026. 
 
Government Regulation and Product Compliance
 
Gene editing is a relatively new technology and the regulatory schemes around the world are continuing to evolve in how countries regulate gene edited crops and food products. Neither we, nor our commercial partners, currently deploy Calyxt technology for use outside of the United States. In today’s global market, overall business development strategy for plant biotechnology companies depends, in part, on the availability of regulatory clearance in strategic export markets, which enables broader flexibility for product expansion and is a key consideration in evaluating global trade opportunities. Regulatory predictability is critical in order to establish accurate product launch strategies. The costs of achieving clearance in foreign countries is often high and there can be no assurance we will be granted clearance on terms favorable to us, if at all. 
 
During the course of 2020, there have been positive regulatory developments with respect to the global regulatory landscape for gene edited products, including the adoption in Japan of guidelines establishing a voluntary consultation process. However, in certain key jurisdictions, including the European Union, China and Mexico, the regulatory path to market for gene edited products remains uncertain.
 
The United States and the European Union are the two leading jurisdictions, with distinct regulatory regimes applying different rules and requirements.
 
United States
 
In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are primarily responsible for overseeing agriculture and food regulation and safety. Biotechnology is regulated in the United States under the “Coordinated Framework for Biotechnology”.

Biotechnology products are subject to EPA regulatory review if they contain plant-incorporated protectants, which refer to pesticides (such as insecticides) produced in plants. As our product candidates do not contain any plant-incorporated protectors, our product candidates are not subject to regulatory review by the EPA.
 
Under the Plant Protection Act (PPA), the USDA requires anyone who wishes to import, transport interstate, or plant a regulated article to apply for a permit or notify the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) that the introduction will be made. Regulated articles are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 7 CFR Part 340.1 as “any organism which has been altered or produced through genetic engineering which USDA determines is a plant pest or has reason to believe is a plant pest.” If APHIS determines the product to be regulated, the product may be subject to extensive regulation, including permitting requirements for import, handling, interstate movement, release into the environment, and inspections.
 
In the last seven years, we submitted petitions to APHIS for eight of our product candidates and received confirmation from APHIS that it does not consider any of the seven to be regulated articles under the Plant Protection Act. The eight product candidates include our high oleic soybean, high oleic low linolenic soybean, high fiber wheat, improved digestibility alfalfa, and cold storable potato. The remaining three submissions were for product candidates for which we are either pursuing derivatives or no longer pursuing at this time. There can be no guarantee of the timing or success in obtaining nonregulated status from APHIS for our other crops or that the governing regulations will not change. 
 
The FDA has oversight of food safety and security pursuant the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and is primarily carried out by its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The FDA regulates ingredients, packaging, and labeling of foods, including nutrition and health claims and the nutrition facts panel. Foods are typically not subject to premarket review and approval requirements, with limited exceptions.
 
The FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to determine whether foods derived from new plant varieties including genetically modified plant varieties require premarket review and approval. Developers routinely consult with the FDA prior to marketing and, in most cases, foods derived from plant varieties developed with biotechnology are not subjected to premarket review and approval processes. 
 
We have completed voluntary consultation with the FDA for our high oleic soybean. After review, the FDA had no further questions concerning human food ingredients or animal food derived from our high oleic soybean. 
 
European Union
 
If we want to market and sell our products in the European Union (the EU), we would only do so once they have gained appropriate regulatory clearance. The procedures for evaluation and authorization of GMOs are established by Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed and Directive 2001/18/EC on the release of GMOs into the environment. An application for authorization must be submitted under Directive 2001/18/EC if a company seeks to release GMOs for experimental purposes (e.g., field tests) and/or to sell GMOs, as such or in products, in the market (e.g., cultivation, importation or processing). In turn, an application for authorization must be submitted under Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 if a company seeks to sell GMOs in the market for food and feed use and/or food and feed products containing or produced from GMOs. At the national level, EU member states can restrict or prohibit GMO cultivation in their territories by invoking grounds such as environmental or agricultural policy objectives, town and country-planning, land use, coexistence, socio-economic impacts, or public policy.
 
In addition, Directive 2001/18/EC, Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 and Regulation (EC) 1830/2003 establish specific labeling and traceability requirements for GMOs and products that contain or are produced from GMOs. Finally, Directives 2002/53/EC and 2002/55/EC require genetically modified varieties to be authorized before they can be included in a Common Catalogue of Varieties, which would permit the seeds of such genetically modified varieties to be marketed in the EU.
 
A ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in July 2018 provided a broad interpretation of the concept of GMO in the EU and a narrow interpretation of possible exemptions to the associated rules. Even with respect to exempted organisms, EU member states may subject them to the obligations under Directive 2001/18/EC or to other obligations.

Competition
 
The market for plant-based technology products is highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of genetically modified traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with a broader set of companies. Additionally, competition for providing more nutritious ingredients for food companies come from chemical-based ingredients, additives, and substitutes, which are developed by various companies.
 
In general, we believe that we face competition from both large agricultural biotechnology, seed, and chemical companies, certain of which have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization, and from specialty food ingredient companies, which are generally focused on providing solutions to the food industry through chemical, synthetic, or other methods. Many of our competitors—particularly large chemical companies—have substantially larger budgets for research and development (R&D), product commercialization and regulatory process management than we do.
 
We also face competition from trait research and development companies as well as agricultural research universities and institutions. Given the global importance of agriculture, there are several companies, research universities and institutions that specialize in R&D of agricultural yield and product quality traits. Because these competitors typically focus on a limited number of traits and do not generally have the product development, gene editing technologies, and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market, they generally out-license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development.
 
We believe that we can compete favorably based on our expertise and the precision, specificity, cost effectiveness and development speed of our proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their R&D or collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in R&D, manufacturing, testing, and marketing approved products than we do.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster, with lower research costs or with more desirable traits than we can.
 
Research and Development
 
Our R&D team has technical expertise in molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, genetics and genetic engineering, plant physiology and plant breeding. Our R&D activities are conducted principally at our Minnesota facility and we also conduct breeding activities through third parties in the United States and its territories and South America. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in R&D. We incurred R&D expenses of $11.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, $12.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and $10.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 59 employees, 38 of whom were in R&D. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in biology, chemistry, plant genetics, agronomy, data science, and other related fields. As early leaders in the field of gene editing for plants, members of our management team have invented TALEN, one of the premier gene editing tools. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our employees are a critical asset. We believe that a critical component to our success depends on the ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel. Recognizing the core importance of our personnel, we attract human capital by providing competitive wages and benefits, and support our employees by promoting health and safety, providing training and development programs that build professional skills, and adhering to our code of conduct and business ethics at all levels of Calyxt.
 
Human capital management strategies are developed collectively by senior management and are overseen by our Board of Directors. We are committed to efforts that ensure that the workplace is respectful, equitable, ethical, and fosters an inclusive work environment across our workforce.

Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
 
We operate in a single segment and geography. Accordingly, no additional segment or geographic information is being presented.

Seasonality 
 
Seed sales are expected to be seasonal and are anticipated to be primarily a function of the purchasing and growing patterns in North America. Seed sales may shift somewhat between quarters, depending on planting and growing conditions, with seed partners’ inventory most typically at its lowest level at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter, which is consistent with the agricultural cycles in our major markets. Additionally, our receivables are expected to be at their lowest levels in our fourth fiscal quarter, primarily because of the seasonality of our sales.
