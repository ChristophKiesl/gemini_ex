--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company devoted to developing and commercializing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases. Our lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease (“DED”) and allergic conjunctivitis (“AC”). We have additional product candidates in development for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (“PVR”), primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (“PVRL”) and other retinal diseases, autoimmune disease, and cancer. We currently intend to commercialize our products directly or through collaborations. None of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere.
 Immune-mediated diseases are conditions that result from an imbalance of inhibitory and stimulatory factors that regulate the immune system. Immunological dysregulation can lead to a broad array of conditions that include autoimmune disease, allergy, immunoproliferative disease, and cancer. Many ocular, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological, and musculoskeletal diseases, affecting tens of millions of patients in the United States and hundreds of millions of patients worldwide, are at least partially immune-mediated. An estimated 7% of western society suffers from some form of immune-mediated disease, and incidence has been increasing. Given the complexity of immune dysregulation, which involves many mediators and signaling pathways, rarely is any single therapeutic approach effective, and today most immune-mediated diseases are generally considered to be inadequately treated. As such, we believe immune-mediated diseases represent considerable unmet medical need, and that demand for novel immune-modulating therapies is high. Consistent with large patient populations and high therapeutic demand, the current market for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases is considerable, representing an excess of $40 billion worldwide.
 Our product development pipeline is focused on immune-mediated ocular diseases and select systemic diseases, and encompasses three distinct biological mechanisms of action: reactive aldehyde species (“RASP”) inhibition, dihydrofolate reductase (“DHFR”) inhibition, and protein chaperome (“CHP”) inhibition. The immunological activity of our product candidates generally leads to diminished levels of pathological inflammation via down-regulation of immune cell activation or proliferation.
 Our lead product candidate reproxalap is a RASP inhibitor that has been shown to diminish ocular inflammation, and has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements across an aggregate of seven Phase 2 clinical trials in DED and AC, a Phase 3 clinical trial in AC, and Part 1 of a Phase 3 clinical trial in DED, when administered topically to the eye as an ophthalmic solution. Administered to the skin as a topical dermatologic formulation in a Phase 2 clinical trial and in Part 1 of a Phase 3 clinical trial, reproxalap demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in ichthyosis (a severe skin disorder) caused by Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome (“SLS”), a rare RASP-mediated disease with no approved therapy. Additionally, in a Phase 1 clinical trial, ADX-629, a first-in-class orally available RASP inhibitor, was well-tolerated and no treatment-related adverse events were observed. Relative to subjects treated with placebo, reduction in the commonly described pro-inflammatory RASP malondialdehyde was observed in ADX-629 treated subjects. A growing body of clinical evidence supports the potential and relevance of RASP inhibition as a new and 
 5

differentiated mechanism of action. We have discovered and are developing additional RASP inhibitors, including ADX-103 for the treatment of retinal disease.
 As we continue to execute on our strategy of expanding our product candidate pipeline, we intend to license or acquire new immune-modulating approaches with novel therapeutic potential. In January 2019, we acquired Helio Vision, Inc. and thereby obtained rights to ADX-2191, an intravitreal DHFR inhibitor (methotrexate) for the prevention of PVR, a serious sight-threatening retinal disease with no approved treatment, and PVRL, a rare cancer with no approved treatment. In addition, in December 2016, we in-licensed the clinical-stage product candidate ADX-1612 (investigated in oncology under the name ganetespib), which inhibits the protein chaperome, a mechanistically differentiated approach for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases. 
 
Our active clinical programs include four unique product candidates, representing three distinct mechanisms of action across a number of different potential indications. All of our development plans and timelines are subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory review, preclinical and clinical results, funding, and other factors that could delay the initiation, completion, or reporting of clinical trials. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing, and patient recruitment have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed. Our pipeline, as of the date of filing this annual report on Form 10-K is illustrated below. 
 Product Candidate Development Pipeline


We have no products approved for sale. We will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties. We have primarily funded our operations through the sale of our common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, warrants, and borrowings under debt facilities.
 6

We will need to raise additional capital in the form of debt or equity or through partnerships to fund additional development of our product candidates, and we may in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses or products. In addition, contingent on capital resources, we may augment, diminish, or otherwise modify the clinical development plan described herein.
 Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues, if any, largely depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete development of and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and to successfully manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter, and depend on a number of factors, including risks related to our business and industry, risks relating to intellectual property and other legal matters, risks related to our common stock, and other risks that are detailed in the section of this annual report on Form 10-K entitled “Risk Factors.” 
 The Markets for Our Product Candidates 
 Dry Eye Disease and Allergic Conjunctivitis – Two Prevalent Diseases with Significant Comorbidity
 The symptoms of dry eye disease (“DED”) (ocular pain, dryness, gritty sensation) and allergic conjunctivitis (“AC”) (ocular itching and tearing) are chronic and persistently disturbing, impacting quality of life and leading to loss of work and substantial economic burden. DED and AC are two of the most common diseases treated by ophthalmologists and optometrists, and physicians and patients regard therapy as inadequate in a substantial number of cases. 
 There are approximately 20 million DED patients diagnosed in the United States, but only three drugs are approved for DED treatment, cyclosporine (0.05% as Restasis® or 0.09% as CequaTM), lifitegrast (5% as Xiidra®), and loteprednol (0.25% as Eysuvis®). The activity of cyclosporine and lifitegrast has been observed to be minimal or lacking in the majority of patients, and weeks or months of treatment may be required to achieve even modest clinical benefit. Loteprednol, a generically available corticosteroid, is indicated only for short-term treatment (up to two weeks) due to corticosteroid-associated toxicity, which includes increases in intraocular pressure that may lead to glaucoma, the development of cataracts, ocular infection, and other ocular morbidities.
 There are approximately 100 million patients in the United States with AC, and we estimate that up to 30 million of such AC patients do not respond adequately to, or are dissatisfied with, topical antihistamines, the current standard of care. A primary reason for dissatisfaction with antihistamines appears to be lack of durable activity, which may be due to the fact that histamine is only one of the biological mediators of the disease, and the fact that increased histamine levels persist for only 10 to 20 minutes following allergen exposure.
 Many patients manifest symptoms of both DED and AC, and differential diagnosis can be challenging for physicians. Approximately half of dry eye patients complain of itching, which is generally considered the result of allergy, and approximately half of AC patients complain of dryness, which is generally considered the result of DED. There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved products that are indicated to treat both DED and AC. Neither cyclosporine nor lifitegrast have been approved for use in patients with AC, and antihistamines are known to exacerbate ocular dryness. Thus, we believe that no currently available drug for DED or AC is likely to be effective for the chronic treatment of patients who experience symptoms of both diseases. 
 By inhibiting RASP, which are elevated in a variety of inflammatory diseases, reproxalap represents a novel mechanism for diminishing ocular inflammation in DED and AC. In three Phase 2 clinical trials in DED, two Phase 2 clinical trials in AC, one Phase 3 trial in AC, and Part 1 of a Phase 3 trial in DED, reproxalap demonstrated consistent statistically significant and clinically relevant activity. We believe that reproxalap may have a commercially differentiated product profile versus currently approved drugs for each indication, having shown the potential for early and broad activity in DED, and durable activity in AC. Additionally, reproxalap may also represent the only product with the potential to treat DED and AC as a chronic therapy, uniquely addressing the needs of the large underserved population that suffers from both diseases. 
 7

Based on the late-stage clinical trial results to date, discussed below, we believe reproxalap could offer superior efficacy relative to existing DED medications, particularly with regard to early onset of action and breadth of activity. Thus, our current expectation is that reproxalap could be priced similarly to, or at a premium to, currently marketed drugs for DED, which are generally priced in the range of $450 to $650 per month. The potential size of the DED market is substantial. Of the estimated 34 million patients with DED in the United States, approximately 20 million are diagnosed. Assuming approximately one-third of diagnosed patients are candidates for prescription medication, and assuming approximately six months of therapy per year, the potential total addressable market for reproxalap therapy in DED is greater than $18 billion in the United States. 
 Contingent on the results of current and planned clinical trials in DED and AC, in addition to regulatory authority approval, we intend to commercialize reproxalap ophthalmic solution directly or through marketing partnerships. 
 
Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy, Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma, and Other Retinal Diseases 
 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (“PVR”) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the retina that leads to severe retinal scarring and blindness, and is the leading cause of failure of retinal reattachment surgery. Over 50% of PVR cases result in severe uncorrectable vision loss (visual acuity of 20/320 or worse), and 76% of PVR patients suffer from at least moderate uncorrectable vision loss. PVR occurs after up to 10% of surgeries for retinal detachment and 50% or more of surgeries for open globe injury. Based on the prevalence of primary retinal detachment, in addition to retinal detachment that occurs as a result of trauma, we estimate that there are, in aggregate, approximately 20,000 treatable cases of PVR in the United States, Europe, and Japan. By inhibiting cell growth and thereby diminishing scar formation, ADX-2191 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved drug for prevention of PVR. In April 2018, ADX-2191 received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the prevention of PVR. In September 2019, ADX-2191 received fast track designation from the FDA for the prevention of PVR.
 Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (“PVRL”) is a rare, aggressive, high-grade cancer that arises in the vitreous and retina. An estimated 2,900 people in the United States suffer from PVRL, and approximately 600 new cases of PVRL are diagnosed in the United States per year. The median survival for newly diagnosed patients is less than five years. In January 2021, we received from the FDA preliminary written comments in preparation for a Pre-IND (“Investigational New Drug”) Type B meeting regarding ADX-2191 for the treatment of PVRL. We believe the comments indicated that submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for ADX-2191 for the treatment of PVRL may be possible without performing clinical trials. In the first quarter of 2021, we held a teleconference with the FDA to discuss the preliminary written comments and clarify the ADX-2191 NDA submission requirements for the treatment of PVRL. We applied for orphan designation for ADX-2191 for the treatment of PVRL in the first half of 2021. ADX-2191 has the potential to be the first drug approved to treat PVRL.
 In addition to PVR and PVRL, the retina is susceptible to a variety of immune-mediated diseases, many of which are mediated by RASP. Inflammatory retinal disorders that involve RASP include both posterior and pan-uveitis, uveitis-associated macular edema, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy. Separately, RASP and RASP-adducts accumulate in dry age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt’s Disease (juvenile dry age-related macular degeneration-like disease), and Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome-associated maculopathy. We believe that the number of patients affected by immune-mediated retinal disorders is considerable. In 2010, the National Eye Institute estimated that diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration represent approximately 10 million patients in the United States, and is expected to grow to almost 14.5 million by 2030. In 2017, the global ophthalmic drugs market was valued at $23 billion, and the market for retinal diseases accounted 39%, or approximately $9 billion, one of the largest ocular segments. Therefore, we believe that the total market potential of RASP inhibitors for the treatment of retinal disease is substantial. 
 Immune-Mediated Systemic Diseases 
 Immune-mediated systemic diseases, such as autoimmune disease, are generally chronic conditions characterized by excessive and misdirected inflammatory responses. In aggregate, autoimmune diseases and related systemic inflammatory disorders represent tens of millions of patients in the United States, with aggregate drug sales expected to exceed $74 billion by 2022. In 2017, three of the top five highest-selling drugs, totaling more than $32 billion globally and $20 billion in United States sales, were prescribed for a variety of immune-mediated 
 8

disorders, including Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The potential market for immune-modulating therapies could continue to expand as a result of growing evidence that excessive inflammation may be critical to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and many other common conditions that are not typically defined as inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. 
 Given the complex pathophysiology of systemic immune-mediated disorders, many of which are caused by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators, therapy often requires combinations of drugs with distinct mechanisms of action. As such, we believe novel product candidates for immune-mediated diseases are in high demand. 
 ADX-1612 (investigated in oncology under the name ganetespib) is a novel drug candidate that inhibits the protein chaperome (CHP). CHP is involved in the processing of a variety of proteins, and appears to be particularly important in cellular proliferation. Many immune-mediated diseases are at least in part the result of hyper-proliferation of immune cells, a phenomenon known as lymphoproliferation. Lymphoproliferative diseases include post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and myelodysplastic syndromes. We are not aware of any other company that is developing a CHP inhibitor for systemic immune-mediated disease. Similar to lymphoproliferative disease, cancer is also characterized by uncontrolled cellular replication, and ADX-1612 may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of certain cancers in combination with other cancer drugs. 
 Additionally, our RASP inhibitor platform represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for a variety of common systemic immune-mediated conditions. Because RASP appear to be involved in the generation and potentiation of inflammation in general, we believe the potential therapeutic applicability of RASP inhibitors is broad. We are not aware of any other company actively developing RASP inhibitors. In 2020, we announced the initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials of ADX-629, a first-in-class orally administered RASP inhibitor, for the treatment of COVID-19, atopic asthma, and psoriasis as part of a systematic strategy to assess activity across different types of immunological diseases. The Phase 2 clinical trials follow a successful Phase 1 clinical trial of ADX-629, in which ADX-629 was well-tolerated, and no treatment-related adverse events were observed and ADX-629 demonstrated target engagement evidenced by statistically lower RASP levels in drug-treated subjects relative to controls.
 The Competitive Landscape of Our Product Candidates 
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and potential commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, and the ability to reduce the dependence on, or the dose of, other drug products. 
 Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and in the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining regulatory approval for products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product that we may commercialize, and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete. 
 While our product candidates may manifest efficacy, tolerability, or safety advantages, many marketed therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the pricing we anticipate for our product candidates. Pricing, in addition to healthcare plan coverage, prior authorization requirements, step edits, co-pay amounts, and related factors, may discourage the initial or prolonged use of our product candidates. Further, the recent growth of Pharmacy Benefit Managers has diminished the profitability of drug commercialization for smaller companies, and 
 9

may hamper our ability to support our operations or compete effectively in the marketplace following regulatory approval, if any.
 RASP Inhibitor Platform 
 A number of academic groups have published on the concept of reducing RASP levels, primarily by using compounds with amines (certain nitrogen-containing molecules) that react with RASP through a chemical process known as the Schiff base reaction. Various RASP-binding amines have been described, particularly carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide), which has other potential mechanisms of action unrelated to RASP. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to temporarily bind retinaldehyde (a RASP) as a potential therapy for retinal disease. Schiff base reactions have also been mentioned as possible explanations for a portion of the activity of aminoguanidine, pyridoxamine, and possibly other non-proprietary amine-containing compounds that have been tested in clinical trials for diabetic nephropathy. However, the Schiff base reaction is reversible, and generally the substrates (precursors) and products of the reaction exist in equilibrium such that, at any point in time, the RASP substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone represent temporary RASP binding, and likely lead to the relocation of RASP rather than the elimination of RASP. We believe that reproxalap and chemically related product candidates that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical structures of our product candidates are novel, and the reaction with RASP has been observed to be essentially irreversible in vivo, which, we believe, may result in a more effective means of diminishing RASP. 
 Other Immune-Modulating Pharmacotherapies 
 A myriad of new treatments have been or are being developed to treat inflammatory diseases, and have been used, or in theory could be used, for the treatment of the diseases that our product candidates are intended to target. Immune-modulating products include cytokine inhibitors, immune cell receptor inhibitors, complement inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Companies that currently market such therapies include Abbvie, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, UCB Inc. and UCB S.A., Amgen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and Pfizer, Inc. Currently marketed products may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over our product candidates, and may be used to treat the diseases for which we are developing our product candidates. In addition, CHP inhibitors other than ADX-1612 are in development for the treatment of cancer, and such compounds could theoretically be used for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. Methotrexate, the active drug substance of ADX-2191, is generically available and has been used as a chemotherapeutic and immune modulating agent, and other formulations or application methods of methotrexate could be developed for the treatment of retinal diseases.
Competitive Product Candidates by Indication 
 We believe the primary competitors by indication with respect to our current programs in late stage-clinical testing are as follows: 
 Competitive Pharmaceuticals by Indication 
 
 
Indication | Competitive Products 
--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dry Eye Disease | Topical immunomodulators, such as cyclosporine (0.05% as Restasis® or 0.09% as CequaTM) and lifitegrast (5% as Xiidra®); topical corticosteroids, such as loteprednol (0.25% as EysuvisTM) and other generic steroids; and artificial tear solutions
Allergic Conjunctivitis | Topical antihistamines and corticosteroids, which may be generic or sold over-the-counter; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); and mast cell stabilizers 
Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy | None 

 10


We believe that there is significant unmet medical need for the diseases that we intend to target. If proven to be safe and effective, we believe that our product candidates could be used in place of, or in addition to, current therapies. Currently available therapies for the treatment of DED are generally considered by physicians and patients to be inadequate, may require weeks or months of treatment to achieve even moderate clinical benefit, and have not demonstrated clinical activity in AC, a common comorbidity. There is no approved therapy for PVR or PVRL.
 Many drugs are in development for AC and DED. In addition, generic versions of Restasis® are also expected to become available in the U.S. in the near future. We believe that there are currently no drugs in development for both DED and AC; PVR; or PVRL. For the diseases we intend to study, there may be other developmental therapies of which we are not aware.
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on our ability to utilize our drug development expertise to identify, develop, secure rights to, and obtain regulatory approvals for promising pharmaceutical products before others are able to develop competitive products. Our ability to compete successfully will also depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. Additionally, our ability to compete may be diminished by insurers and other third-party payors, which often encourage the use of cheaper, non-innovative, or generic products. 
 Clinical Trial Results and Development Plans 
 Prior to applying for marketing approval, our product candidates must satisfy regulatory authority requirements for safety and efficacy, including pivotal Phase 3 clinical assessment. Our active clinical programs with reproxalap have consistently demonstrated statistically and clinically significant efficacy, and have advanced to late-stage clinical testing. In addition, reproxalap has been observed to be well-tolerated and reported adverse events were generally mild in our clinical trials to date. Our material clinical results have been previously disclosed elsewhere in detail, and we encourage review of all of our clinical trial disclosures. All of our development plans and timelines are subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory review, preclinical and clinical results, funding, and other factors that could delay the initiation, completion, or reporting of clinical trials. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical site availability, staffing, and patient recruitment have been negatively affected and the timelines to complete our clinical trials may be delayed.
Dry Eye Disease
 In September 2017, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked Phase 2a clinical trial of reproxalap ophthalmic solution demonstrated statistically and clinically relevant improvement from baseline in multiple signs and symptoms associated with dry eye disease. In September 2018, we announced that the results of a randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, double-masked Phase 2b clinical trial of 0.1% and 0.25% concentrations of reproxalap topical ophthalmic solution demonstrated statistically significant improvement over vehicle in ocular signs and symptoms associated with DED (Figure 1). Relative to patients treated with vehicle, patients treated with the 0.25% concentration of reproxalap demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in the Four-Symptom Ocular Dryness Score and the Overall Ocular Discomfort Symptom Score. For drug-treated patients, improvement greater than that of vehicle was consistently observed across all symptoms, and activity versus vehicle was evident as early as two weeks, the first assessment following initiation of therapy. The early onset of symptomatic improvement is consistent with the Phase 2a clinical trial of topical ocular reproxalap in dry eye disease, and is supportive of a differentiated product profile relative to standard of care. Patients treated with the 0.25% concentration of reproxalap also demonstrated reductions in ocular fluorescein staining score that were statistically superior to those of patients treated with vehicle. Both 0.1% and 0.25% reproxalap concentrations demonstrated activity relative to vehicle, and a clear dose response was observed.

Figure 1: Phase 2b Dry Eye Disease Clinical Trial Results
 
In April 2019, we initiated the RENEW Trial, an ongoing adaptive, two-part, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group Phase 3 trial of 0.25% topical ocular reproxalap compared to vehicle in patients with moderate to severe DED. The primary objective of RENEW Part 1 was to confirm dosing regimen, endpoints, and sample size for RENEW Part 2. In Part 1 of RENEW, 422 patients were randomized equally to receive either four-times-daily reproxalap or vehicle for twelve weeks (the constant dosing group) or four-times-daily reproxalap or vehicle for four weeks, followed by twice-daily reproxalap or vehicle for eight weeks (the induction-maintenance dosing group). In December 2019, we announced that, in the induction-maintenance dosing group, the RENEW co-primary endpoint of patient-reported visual analog scale (“VAS”) ocular dryness from Weeks 2 to 12 was achieved (p=0.0004) (Figure 2), and that activity was observed as early as one week after initiation of therapy (p=0.001) and was maintained until the end of the trial. 
Figure 2: RENEW Part 1 Results – Co-Primary Symptom Endpoint
 

SEM = standard error of the mean

In the induction-maintenance dosing group from Weeks 2 to 12, reproxalap was statistically superior to vehicle in VAS ocular endpoints for itching (p=0.03), foreign body sensation (p=0.004), discomfort (p=0.003), photophobia (p=0.004), and pain (p=0.03) (Figure 3). In the induction-maintenance dosing group from Weeks 2 to 12, reproxalap was statistically superior to vehicle in Ocular Discomfort & 4-Symptom Questionnaire ocular endpoints for dryness (p=0.01), discomfort (p=0.03), burning (p=0.03), grittiness (p=0.003), and stinging (p=0.02). Although the improvement effect size of the co-primary endpoint of fluorescein nasal region ocular staining did not reach statistical significance, reproxalap was statistically superior to vehicle in reduction from baseline in the induction-maintenance dosing group from Weeks 1 to 4 of treatment (p=0.03), and statistical separation from vehicle was observed at Week 2 (p=0.04).
Figure 3: RENEW Part 1 Results – Symptom Treatment Differences Over Weeks 2 to 12
 

In February of 2020, we announced that the results of a randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, double-masked Phase 2 clinical trial of a novel formulation of 0.25% reproxalap topical ophthalmic solution demonstrated statistically significant improvement over vehicle for the primary endpoint of VAS ocular dryness score (p=0.03). Consistent with the RENEW trial, approximately 100 patients were enrolled per arm, and drug was administered via the induction maintenance regimen. The novel formulation is substantially similar to the formulations used in the Phase 2b clinical trial and the RENEW Trial, differing only in the amount of a single excipient. 
 In January 2021, we announced positive top-line symptom, redness, and Schirmer’s test results from the run-in cohort of the Phase 3 TRANQUILITY clinical trial of reproxalap in patients with dry eye disease. The TRANQUILITY Trial was designed to assess the acute activity of reproxalap over one day of therapy and within minutes of drug administration. Patients were treated with four doses of 0.25% reproxalap for one day. On the following day, patients were administered a single dose before entry, and a dose 45 minutes after entry, to a dry eye chamber with minimal humidity, high airflow, and forced visual tasking. The run-in cohort, performed at a single center, was double-masked, and randomized 12 patients to receive reproxalap and 11 patients to receive vehicle. Over the first day of dosing, Schirmer test scores were directionally in favor of reproxalap over vehicle, and reproxalap was statistically superior to vehicle in improvement in VAS dryness score (p=0.003), ocular discomfort 4-symptom questionnaire (OD4SQ) dryness score (p=0.006), OD4SQ grittiness score (p=0.006), and OD4SQ discomfort score (p=0.003). Over all time points in aggregate in the dry eye chamber, reproxalap was observed to be statistically superior to vehicle for the two assessed symptoms, VAS ocular dryness score (p=0.001) (Figure 4) and 
 13

ocular discomfort score (p<0.0001). Reproxalap also demonstrated statistically significant improvement over vehicle (p=0.03) in ocular redness (Figure 5), an objective sign of dry eye disease. Improvement in ocular symptoms and redness occurred within minutes after reproxalap dosing. Additionally, tear RASP levels were reduced after single doses of reproxalap, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts (HNE). For subjects with sufficient tear volumes for analysis, across the two doses where tear RASP levels were assessed before and after drug administration, HNE levels declined by an average of 1018 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) in reproxalap-treated patients (n=9) versus an increase of 32 pg/mL in vehicle-treated patients (n=7).
 Figure 4: Phase 3 TRANQUILITY Run-In Cohort Dry Eye Chamber Results – Ocular Dryness
 


Figure 5: Phase 3 TRANQUILITY Run-In Cohort Dry Eye Chamber Results – Ocular Redness
 
TRANQUILITY, and a similar trial, TRANQUILITY-2, are anticipated to enrolled approximately 300 patients under a protocol similar to the run-in cohort, and are expected to conclude in 2021. Pending results from the TRANQUILITY trials, a dry eye disease safety trial, drug supply stability studies, and regulatory input, we believe that a potential NDA filing for reproxalap for the treatment of dry eye disease could occur as early as the end of 2021.In all reproxalap dry eye disease clinical trials completed to date, no adverse findings on safety assessments were observed, and reproxalap was well tolerated. Transient and generally mild instillation site discomfort is the most commonly reported adverse event.

Allergic Conjunctivitis 
 In February 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of reproxalap ophthalmic solution in patients with AC demonstrated statistically and clinically significant activity of reproxalap over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing. In June 2017, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial of 0.1% and 0.5% topical ocular reproxalap in patients with AC demonstrated statistically and clinically significant activity of reproxalap over vehicle in reducing ocular itching. In the Phase 2b clinical trial, which assessed ocular itching (scale 0 to 4) via a conjunctival allergen challenge model (allergen administered directly to the eye), the activity of reproxalap in subjects challenged with seasonal allergens was statistically significantly superior to activity in vehicle-treated subjects, as measured by area under the itch score curve from 10 to 60 minutes post-challenge. In addition, responder (two-point improvement from baseline itch score) probability in drug-treated patients was statistically superior to that of vehicle-treated patients for subjects challenged with seasonal allergens (Figure 6). A clear dose response was observed. 
Figure 6: Phase 2b Allergic Conjunctivitis Clinical Trial Results
 


In March 2019, we announced that the Phase 3 ALLEVIATE clinical trial met the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint for both concentrations of reproxalap (Figure 7). The double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group conjunctival allergen challenge Phase 3 ALLEVIATE trial assessed the efficacy and safety of 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations of reproxalap topical ophthalmic solutions compared to vehicle in 318 patients (approximately 100 per arm) with seasonal AC. The primary efficacy endpoint was the evaluation of ocular itch score (0 to 4 scale) area under the curve from 10 to 60 minutes after allergen challenge, and the key secondary endpoint was two-point responder rate, a measure of clinical relevance. Relative to patients treated with vehicle, patients treated with 0.25% and 0.5% reproxalap demonstrated statistically significant reduction in ocular itching (p<0.0001 and p=0.0025, respectively), as assessed by area under the ocular itch score curve. Two-point responder rates for 0.25% and 0.5% reproxalap were statistically greater than that of vehicle-treated patients (p=0.0005 and p=0.0169, respectively), confirming the clinical relevance of the observed primary endpoint improvements. Both concentrations of reproxalap exhibited an anti-inflammatory profile that is distinct from standard-of-care antihistamine therapy and support a differentiated mechanism of action for the treatment of AC.

Figure 7: Phase 3 ALLEVIATE Allergic Conjunctivitis Clinical Trial Results (0.25% Reproxalap)
 

In October 2019, we announced expanded results from our allergen chamber clinical methods trial of topical ocular reproxalap in patients with AC. The double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, crossover allergen chamber clinical methods trial assessed the efficacy and safety of 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations of reproxalap topical ophthalmic solution compared with vehicle in 70 patients with ocular allergy to ragweed. Patient-reported ocular itching and tearing, and investigator-assessed ocular redness, were recorded at various intervals over approximately 3.5 hours during aerosolized exposure to a standardized amount of ragweed pollen. Test article was administered before chamber entry and at 90 minutes post-entry, near the peak of allergy symptoms and signs.  Relative to patients treated with vehicle, patients treated with 0.25% or 0.5% reproxalap demonstrated statistically significant reduction in ocular itching (p<0.0001), redness (p<0.0001), and tearing (p<0.0001). The total ocular symptom score, a combination of itching, redness, and tearing, was also significantly lower in reproxalap-treated subjects than in vehicle-treated subjects (p<0.0001 for both concentrations) (Figure 8). Consistent with the positive results from the Phase 3 ALLEVIATE trial in AC, there was no statistical difference between the activity of 0.25% and 0.5% reproxalap. 
Figure 8: Allergen Chamber Clinical Methods Allergic Conjunctivitis Trial Results (0.25% Reproxalap)
 
In 2020, based on the success of the Phase 3 ALLEVIATE trial and the allergen chamber clinical trial, we initiated the Phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of topical ocular reproxalap for the treatment of AC. The Phase 3 INVIGORATE trial will evaluate 0.25% reproxalap versus vehicle in an allergen chamber. The primary endpoint 
 16

will be achieved if statistically significant reduction in ocular itching between drug and vehicle is demonstrated at the majority of eleven time points in a pre-specified range from 110 to 210 minutes following chamber entry. In the completed allergen chamber trial, reproxalap was statistically superior to vehicle at every time point to be pre-specified in the INVIGORATE trial.
 In all reproxalap allergic conjunctivitis clinical trials completed to date, no adverse findings on safety assessments were observed, and reproxalap was well tolerated. Transient and generally mild instillation site discomfort is the most commonly reported adverse event. Pending results from INVIGORATE, an allergic conjunctivitis safety trial, drug supply stability studies, and regulatory input, we believe that a potential NDA filing for reproxalap for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis could occur as early as the end of 2021.
 Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy 
 Standard of care treatment for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (“PVR”) results in subsequent retinal detachment surgical rates that approximate 50%. In a single-arm, open-label, investigator-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial performed at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, approximately 20% of patients with PVR treated with multiple injections of ADX-2191 required subsequent surgery for retinal detachment. Thus, relative to standard of care, ADX-2191 may reduce incidence of retinal detachment following the development of PVR, thereby increasing the probability of preservation of visual function.
 In December 2019, we initiated the Phase 3 GUARD trial, a two-part, multi-center, randomized, controlled, adaptive Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of intravitreal injections of ADX-2191 versus standard-of-care for the prevention of PVR. GUARD will compare recurrent retinal detachment rates over a 24-week period following surgical repair of retinal detachment due to PVR or open globe injury. In September 2019, the FDA granted fast track designation to ADX-2191 for the prevention of PVR. ADX-2191 has also received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the prevention of PVR. 
 
Systemic RASP Inhibition for the Treatment of Immune-Mediated Diseases
 
In December 2020, we announced the initiation of Phase 2 clinical trials of ADX-629, a first-in-class orally administered reactive aldehyde species (RASP) inhibitor, for the treatment of COVID-19, atopic asthma, and psoriasis as part of a systematic strategy to assess activity across different types of immunological diseases. The Phase 2 clinical trials follow a successful Phase 1 clinical trial of ADX-629, which observed no treatment-related adverse events at any dose tested, as well as target engagement evidenced by statistically lower RASP levels in drug-treated subjects relative to controls (Figure 9). Following completion of the Phase 2 clinical trials, subsequent clinical indications may be selected, depending on the clinical activity of ADX-629, cytokine profiles, and levels of RASP inhibition.

Chaperome-Dependent Cancers
 An open-label, multicenter, international, European-based, parallel-group, randomized investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of ADX-1612 in combination with other chemotherapies in patients with ovarian cancer, carcinosarcoma, or fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer was initiated in November 2018. Approximately 120 patients are expected to be randomized equally to one of three treatment arms: carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel or gemcitabine followed by niraparib; ADX-1612 in combination with carboplatin followed by niraparib; or ADX-1612 in combination with carboplatin followed by niraparib plus ADX-1612.
 In addition, in September 2018, we announced positive results from the MESO-2 investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ADX-1612 in patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma. ADX-1612, when combined with standard pemetrexed and platinum therapy, resulted in partial response rates that exceeded historical standard of care. Twenty-seven patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma were enrolled at a single site in the United Kingdom, and were divided into one of three cohorts receiving 100, 150, or 200 mg/m2 of ADX-1612 on days 1 and 15 every 21 days. Of 23 evaluable patients, 22 patients (96%) manifested stable disease or clinical response, and one patient (4%) with non-epithelial histology progressed, as measured by via RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. The overall response rate was 61%, relative to historical standard of care response rates of 20% to 40%. The response rate in patients with epithelial histology was 76%. In seven patients, reduction of tumor burden was greater than 50%. One patient remained progression-free after 37 months. ADX-1612 was observed to be well-tolerated, and dose-limiting toxicity was observed in three patients, all of whom were enrolled in the highest dose group.
The Science Supporting Our Product Candidates 
 Reactive Aldehyde Species 
 In response to infection, injury, endogenous and exogenous chemical triggers, heat, and other stimuli, pro-inflammatory reactive aldehyde species (“RASP”) are generated through a variety of metabolic processes, including alcohol oxidation, enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid oxidation, and polyamine and sphingosine metabolism. RASP appear to effect inflammation signaling via covalent binding to thiol (sulfur-containing) and amine (nitrogen-containing) residues on proteins, including receptors and enzymes. RASP-protein adducts directly influence the function of proteins, leading to activation of intracellular inflammatory factors, including NF-κB, an important mediator in the inflammatory response, and inflammasomes. In addition, RASP adducts bind to Scavenger Receptor A, which also initiates pro-inflammatory signaling and leads to the formation of antibodies against the adducted protein, at least in part explaining the presence of host-directed antibodies in autoimmune diseases such as 
 18

rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of RASP are generally observed to be elevated in ocular and systemic inflammatory disease, and thus represent therapeutic targets for immune-modulation. 
 Because of the inherent toxicity of RASP, most, if not all, living organisms contain enzymes, such as aldehyde reductases and aldehyde dehydrogenases, that convert RASP into non-toxic molecules. Genetic mutations in the RASP-metabolizing enzymes cause disease. In SLS, mutations in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase are responsible for skin, neurological, and retinal disease. In particular, ichthyosis, the severe skin disease associated with SLS, is thought to be due to RASP binding to epidermal fats that prevent moisture loss, leading to thick, scaly, dry, flaking, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. 
 Aside from the stimulation of inflammation, there is no generally accepted biological role of high levels of RASP. Some physiologic molecules have RASP forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin B6), but the activity of physiological RASP is highly restricted by chaperone and other proteins that prevent reaction with other molecules, including our RASP inhibitors. Thus, pharmacotherapeutic RASP inhibition is expected not to adversely affect normal physiologic processes. Consistent with the lack of accessibility of physiologic RASP, our most advanced RASP inhibitor, reproxalap, which has been administered to approximately 1,200 patients across fifteen completed clinical trials, has been observed to be generally well tolerated and has not resulted in any serious adverse events. 
 The RASP Inhibitor Platform 
 We are currently developing reproxalap, a new chemical entity, and other novel RASP inhibitors for the treatment of immune-mediated disease. Reproxalap is a small molecule designed specifically to bind, and thereby allow for the degradation of, RASP. In in vitro and animal studies, reproxalap does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes, ion channels, or other proteins. Reproxalap has been shown to outcompete cellular constituents to covalently bind and trap RASP. Reproxalap-RASP adducts appear to be rapidly degraded in cellular environments, after which neither reproxalap nor RASP are detectable. Outside of biological systems, reproxalap-RASP adducts have shown to be remarkably non-reactive and stable, suggesting that reproxalap-RASP binding may be effectively irreversible. By forming covalent drug-RASP adducts that are then degraded, reproxalap and other RASP inhibitors have the potential to substantially lower RASP levels. 
 We believe we have been the first to demonstrate the beneficial effects of RASP inhibition in a variety of animal models relating to immune-mediated disease, suggesting that reproxalap and analogs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects that persist hours after administration at a variety of different doses relevant to clinical testing.

• | In mice injected with a pro-inflammatory agent known as endotoxin, intraperitoneally administered reproxalap statistically reduced a variety of inflammatory cytokines (protein inflammatory mediators), including IL-5, Il-1ß, IL-17, and TNF-α, while up-regulating the primary anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Additionally, in models of mouse contact dermatitis (induced by phorbol myristate acetate) and allergic contact dermatitis (induced by sensitivity to oxazolone), reproxalap statistically reduced inflammation as measured by edema (swelling).

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thus, we believe that the immune-modulating mechanism of action of RASP inhibition is potentially multifactorial – lowering inflammation, reducing healing time, diminishing scarring, and mitigating inflammatory pain – and may ameliorate inflammatory disease and deter disease progression in different ways simultaneously. 
 In addition to the development of reproxalap, we intend to continue the discovery and development of other novel RASP inhibitors, and we intend to continue to develop intellectual property around such molecules. We have identified, synthesized, and tested numerous molecules that may be more potent than reproxalap in inhibiting RASP. We are currently screening novel product candidates to address diseases where topical and systemic administration may reduce RASP-mediated pathology. We have nominated two new RASP inhibitors, ADX-103 and ADX-629, for clinical development. Development of ADX-103 for the treatment of inflammatory retinal disease may begin in 2022, depending on additional preclinical data, regulatory discussions, funding, and other factors. Clinical development of ADX-629 for the treatment of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases began in late 2019.  
 The Potential of ADX- 2191 to Prevent Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy 
 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (“PVR”) is characterized by excessive replication and pro-inflammatory activity of retinal cells, at least a portion of which synthesize collagen, the principal component of scar tissue. Retinal scarring can lead to impairment of vision, including blindness, as well as increased probability of further retinal detachments. Methotrexate, the active component of ADX-2191 (intravitreal methotrexate), is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor that has been used to treat cancer and autoimmune disease. The anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition are well described. In preclinical studies of primary cell cultures from PVR patients, dihydrofolate reductase inhibition reduced pathological cell proliferation and scar-like collagen deposition. Thus, the observed clinical activity of ADX-2191 in PVR is believed to be the result of down-regulation of aberrant retinal cell proliferation and activity, thereby leading to reduced retinal scarring. 
The Immune Modulating and Anti-Proliferative Activity of Chaperome Inhibition 
 ADX-1612 is a novel, highly potent small molecule protein chaperome (“CHP”) inhibitor that has completed numerous clinical trials in oncologic diseases. The CHP system is involved in the processing of proteins that are critical for physiologic cellular function. Inhibition of Hsp90 and potentially other members of the CHP system leads to diminished cellular replication. ADX-1612 appears to be reasonably well tolerated at doses that have been used in clinical testing. 
 Hsp90 is elevated in autoimmune disease, and is believed to lead to broad activation of the immune system. Preclinical results have shown the potential of ADX-1612 to diminish inflammatory cytokines, immune cell numbers, autoantibody formation, and lymphadenopathy (pathologic swelling of the lymph glands, in part due to immune cell hyper-proliferation). In addition, ADX-1612 appears to preserve organ function in animal models of autoimmune disease. The immune-modulating potential of ADX-1612 was observed clinically in a patient treated for Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia, in whom resolution of vasculitis (a systemic autoimmune disease) occurred during treatment.
 20

ADX-1612 in combination with DNA-damaging agents, may have utility in the treatment of certain cancers. CHP is required for DNA repair, and CHP inhibition in the setting of DNA damage could lead to cancer cell death. In ovarian cancer cell lines, preclinical studies have demonstrated the anti-proliferative synergy of ADX-1612 in combination with platinum-containing DNA damaging agents. 
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 Overview 
 In the United States and abroad, we are building an intellectual property portfolio for reproxalap and other RASP inhibitors, CHP inhibitors, and the therapeutic methods of use of DHFR inhibition. We currently seek, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, methods of use, and processes for manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our current policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on, and will continue to rely on, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, our ability to defend our patents, and our ability to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Patent Portfolio 
 Our patent portfolio currently includes patents and patent applications covering the composition, formulation, and uses of reproxalap, ADX-103, ADX-629, ADX-1612, and other novel compounds. As of December 31, 2020, we owned eleven United States patents and eight pending United States non-provisional patent applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to these patents and patent applications, relating to reproxalap, ADX-103, and ADX-629. Additionally, we have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications relating to ADX-1612, and retain an exclusive license to certain patents related to the use of ADX-2191 for the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinal disease.
  We expect the issued reproxalap composition of matter patent in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2028. It is possible that the term of the composition of matter patent in the United States may be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect the foreign reproxalap composition of matter patents, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2026. We expect other patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2026 to 2034. Reproxalap composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe (validated in approximately 14 member countries), Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia and South Korea. Reproxalap composition of matter patent claims are pending in Brazil.

 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We currently require and will continue to require each of our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of such individual’s employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from such individual’s work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed by a consultant for us. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We have no immediate plans to purchase, erect, or otherwise create any manufacturing facilities to be owned by us for any of these purposes, and intend to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production at such time. We may utilize third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors. We believe that the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials needed for the formulation of our product candidates are relatively easy to manufacture, and that multiple suppliers and formulators could be employed for this purpose. Further, we believe the raw materials needed for manufacture of our product candidates, as well as other components of our formulations, are generally readily available currently from multiple sources. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 11 full-time employees and had engaged a number of consultants. We expect that a number of consultants previously engaged in development of our product candidates will participate in ongoing clinical and manufacturing activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Human Capital
 We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. Our employees are a significant asset and we aim to create an equitable, inclusive and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our current pipeline and future business goals. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our clinical trials, our pipeline, our platform technologies, business and operations, and also protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce include providing competitive compensation and benefits packages and ensuring we listen to our employees.
 23

We value innovation, passion, data-driven decision making, persistence and honesty, and are building a diverse environment where our employees can thrive and be inspired to make exceptional contributions to bring novel and more effective therapies to cancer patients.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, motivating and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through grants of stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We are committed to providing a competitive and comprehensive benefits package to our employees. Our benefits package provides a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual health and wellness needs of our employees. We plan to continue to refine our efforts related to optimizing our use of human capital as we grow, including improvements in the way we hire, develop, motivate and retain employees.
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection(s) of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the 
 24

product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a partial or complete clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if the potential for unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the FDA’s or IRB’s requirements. Other conditions may also be imposed. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The investigational drug product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The investigational drug product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations suggest that certain dosing regimens may be efficacious and may have an acceptable safety profile, trials may be undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage and to obtain evidence of potential clinical efficacy and safety. These studies may include multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Data generated from these studies may be used to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the investigational drug product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product, if approved.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s commitment to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and/or effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies and reporting or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to prescription drug program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept 
 25

an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe after acceptance of filing. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months after acceptance of filing. 
 It is likely that our product candidates will be granted a Standard Review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDA’s review may include the participation of both the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This has the potential to complicate or prolong review of the application. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the drug substance or drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. FDA may also inspect sponsor facilities to determine if nonclinical and clinical studies were conducted in compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if potential adverse safety findings are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 Products may be promoted only for the approved labeled indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a specific warning. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company would be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/facility listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 
 26

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations may also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and may impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated seriousness, severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. Physicians may prescribe for off-label uses; manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Reproxalap has received orphan designation for the treatment of congenital ichthyosis, and ADX-2191 has received orphan designation for the prevention of proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 27

If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it was studied, the sponsor will be entitled to seven years of product marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited and rare circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor’s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless superior safety or efficacy of our drug is demonstrated. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations and, if applicable, quality system regulation requirements for medical devices. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA and may be subject to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary 
 28

corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. There are evolving legal requirements and other statutory and regulatory regimes that will continue to affect our business. 
Research and Development Expenses 
 Substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date have been related to the development of reproxalap and our other product candidates. Our research and development expenses totaled $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $44.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
 We anticipate that we will incur additional research and development expenses in the future as we evaluate and possibly pursue the development of our product candidates for additional indications, or develop additional product candidates. 
 We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
  
• | salaries and related expenses for personnel;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | fees paid to consultants and contract research organizations in conjunction with independently monitoring clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with clinical trials, including all related fees such as investigator grants, patient screening, lab work and data compilation and statistical analysis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs incurred with third parties related to the establishment of a commercially viable manufacturing process for our product candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs related to upfront, milestone payments under in-licensing agreements as well as costs for unapproved inventory for which there is no future alternative use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs related to compliance with FDA regulatory requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | consulting fees paid to third-parties involved in research and development activities; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs related to stock options or other stock-based compensation granted to personnel in development functions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred. 
 29

We expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future non-clinical, preclinical and clinical development programs. These expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in terms of both their timing and total cost to completion. We expect to continue to develop stable formulations of our product candidates, test such formulations in preclinical studies for toxicology, safety and efficacy and to conduct clinical trials for each product candidate. We anticipate funding clinical trials for our product candidates ourselves, but we may engage collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more, the length of time generally varying with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to but not limited to the following: 
  
• | the number of sites included in the trials;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of patients that participate in the trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of doses that patients receive;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the duration of patient follow-up;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the phase of development the product candidate is in; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. 
 None of our product candidates have received FDA or foreign regulatory marketing approval. In order to grant marketing approval, a health authority such as the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical and preclinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates with an appropriate benefit to risk profile relevant to a particular indication, and that the product can be manufactured under cGMP in a reproducible manner to deliver the product’s intended performance in terms of its stability, quality, purity and potency. Until our submission is reviewed by a health authority, there is no way to predict the outcome of their review. Even if the clinical studies meet their predetermined primary endpoints, and a registration dossier is accepted for filing, a health authority could still determine that an appropriate benefit to risk relationship does not exist for the indication that we are seeking. 
 We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements. 
 As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of an approved product candidate.
