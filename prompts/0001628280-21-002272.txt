Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for dermatological diseases with high unmet medical needs. Our current portfolio is comprised of highly differentiated topical treatments with significant potential to treat immune-mediated dermatological diseases and conditions. We believe we have built the industry's leading platform for dermatologic product development. Our strategy is to focus on validated biological targets, and to use our platform and deep dermatology expertise to develop differentiated products that have the potential to address the major shortcomings of existing therapies in our targeted indications. We believe this strategy uniquely positions us to rapidly progress towards our goal of bridging the treatment innovation gap in dermatology, while maximizing our probability of technical success and financial resources. 
Our lead product candidate, topical roflumilast cream, has successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in plaque psoriasis, demonstrating symptomatic improvement and favorable tolerability in this population. We are currently preparing a New Drug Application (NDA), with a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected in the second half of 2021. Roflumilast is a highly potent and selective phosphodiesterase type 4, or PDE4, inhibitor, an established biological target in dermatology, with multiple PDE4 inhibitors approved by the FDA for dermatological conditions. We are developing roflumilast cream for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including psoriasis in intertriginous regions such as the groin, axillae, and inframammary areas, as well as atopic dermatitis. We have also successfully completed a long-term safety study of roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis patients, showing continued symptomatic improvement and favorable tolerability over a treatment period of 52 to 64 weeks. In atopic dermatitis, we have completed a Phase 2 proof of concept study of roflumilast cream and recently initiated Phase 3 clinical trials with topline data expected in the second half of 2022.
We are also developing a topical foam formulation of roflumilast, and have successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials in both seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. In seborrheic dermatitis, we had a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and plan to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the second or third quarter of 2021, with topline data expected in the second or third quarter of 2022. Pending discussions with regulators, we expect to initiate our Phase 3 program in scalp psoriasis in the second half of 2021, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022.
Beyond this, we are developing ARQ-252, a potent and highly selective topical Janus kinase type 1, or JAK1, inhibitor. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2b clinical study for the treatment of chronic hand eczema and expect topline data in mid-2021. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study of ARQ-252 for the treatment of vitiligo in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have formulation and preclinical efforts underway for ARQ-255, an alternative deep-penetrating topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata.
Dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, hand eczema, alopecia areata, and vitiligo affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide each year, impacting their quality of life, and physical, functional and emotional well-being. There are many approved treatments for these conditions, but a large opportunity remains due to issues with existing treatments. Topical treatments are used for nearly all patients, but existing topicals are limited by one or more of the following: modest response rates, side effects, patient adherence, application site restrictions, and limits on duration of therapy. Topical corticosteroids, or TCS, are commonly used as the first-line therapy for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. While many patients see improvements, long-term TCS treatment carries the risk of a variety of significant side effects. As a result, TCS are typically used intermittently for brief periods, which can lead to disease flares when patients stop TCS therapy. In psoriasis, vitamin D analogs are also used, but have lower response rates than TCS and are frequently irritating. In atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or TCIs, and Eucrisa, a topical non-steroidal PDE4 inhibitor, are used, but have lower response rates than TCS and are associated with application site burning. TCIs also have a boxed warning for cancer risk. In seborrheic dermatitis, in addition to TCS, topical antifungals are commonly used, but have limited efficacy.
Biologic and systemic therapies are also available for some diseases, but are indicated for a small percentage of the affected population. Biologics for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis have shown impressive response rates but are only indicated for the minority of patients with moderate-to-severe forms of disease, are expensive, and often face reimbursement and access restrictions. Use of oral systemic therapies such as methotrexate and apremilast (Otezla) are also limited to more severe psoriasis patients and have significant side effect risks.

Additionally, many patients on biologic and systemic therapies still require adjunctive topical therapy to treat residual symptoms.
Given the limitations associated with existing treatments, we believe patients with inflammatory skin conditions and their dermatologists are dissatisfied with their current treatment options. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to leverage developments in other fields of medicine, particularly inflammation and immunology, to address the significant need for effective chronic treatments in immuno-dermatology. Our initial focus is to address patients’ significant need for innovative topical treatments that directly target molecular mediators of disease, have the potential to show significant symptomatic improvement, maintain a low risk of toxicity or side effects, and are suitable for chronic use on all areas of the body. Based on market research and our internal estimates, we estimate our primary addressable market opportunity, which focuses on U.S. patients treated by dermatologists with topical therapies, at 5 million patients across psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. There are millions of additional U.S. patients suffering from chronic hand eczema, vitiligo, and alopecia areata, as well as millions of patients treated by physicians other than dermatologists for their psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage recent innovations in inflammation and immunology to identify molecules against validated biological targets in dermatology, and to develop and commercialize best-in-class products based on those molecules that address significant unmet needs in immuno-dermatology:
Key elements of our strategy include:
•Rapidly develop and commercialize our lead product candidate, topical roflumilast cream, for the treatment of patients with plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Based on the clinical data generated to date, we believe roflumilast cream has the potential to be the best-in-class non-steroidal topical treatment, with symptomatic improvement similar to high potency steroids while potentially delivering a low risk of side effects and a favorable tolerability profile that enables chronic administration, including for pediatric patients. In plaque psoriasis, we have successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as a long-term safety study. We are currently preparing an NDA, with a submission to the FDA expected in the second half of 2021. In atopic dermatitis, we have completed a Phase 2 proof of concept study and recently initiated Phase 3 clinical trials with topline data expected in the second half of 2022.
•Expand our addressable market with topical roflumilast foam. We are developing a foam formulation of roflumilast for the treatment of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, diseases impacting hair-bearing areas of the body where a cream is not suitable. We have successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials with roflumilast foam in both seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis, demonstrating promising efficacy and tolerability in both diseases. In seborrheic dermatitis, we had a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and plan to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the second or third quarter of 2021, with topline data expected in the second or third quarter of 2022. Pending discussions with regulators, we expect to initiate our Phase 3 program in scalp psoriasis in the second half of 2021, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022.
•Further expand our product portfolio through the development of ARQ-252/ARQ-255. We are developing ARQ-252, a JAK1 inhibitor with a high relative selectivity to JAK1 over Janus kinase type 2, or JAK2, inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hand eczema and vitiligo, and potentially alopecia areata. Given its high relative selectivity to JAK1 over JAK2, we believe ARQ-252 has the potential to treat inflammatory diseases without causing the hematopoietic adverse effects associated with JAK2 inhibition, giving it the potential to be best-in-class. We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2b clinical study for the treatment of chronic hand eczema and expect topline data in mid-2021. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study of ARQ-252 for the treatment of vitiligo in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have formulation and preclinical efforts underway for ARQ-255, an alternative topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata.
•Establish an integrated development and commercial organization. We believe the concentrated prescriber base of the U.S. dermatology segment provides us with the opportunity to build a fully integrated commercial organization and targeted sales force for the commercialization of our product candidates among dermatology specialists. To further enhance the value of our product candidates, we may selectively seek partners to commercialize our products outside of the dermatology specialist segment, and to develop and commercialize our products outside of the U.S. market.
•Leverage our product development platform to continue innovating and developing novel new treatments for dermatological diseases. Our expertise in dermatological clinical development and commercialization allows us to identify areas of high unmet needs, and our product development platform may allow us to develop novel new treatments that address those needs, as it has already with roflumilast cream, roflumilast foam, and ARQ-252/ARQ-255. 
•Evaluate strategic opportunities to in-license best-in-class dermatology assets consistent with our core strategy. Leveraging our deep expertise in identifying promising drug candidates in dermatology, we will continue to seek best-in-class assets across treatment modalities directed against validated targets. We will continue to explore opportunities to in-license assets and develop them to address unmet medical needs in dermatology.

We believe one of our core strengths is that we have built the industry's leading platform for dermatology product development. This platform, coupled with our deep expertise in dermatology clinical development and commercialization, is the engine that allows us to generate our highly differentiated product candidates. Our platform has already generated several significant innovations, including:
•Our innovative topical formulation of roflumilast (patented)
•A novel topical cream without skin-drying surfactants (patent pending)
•The first topical treatment for seborrheic dermatitis with dual anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory action (patent pending)
•Our novel “4D” deep-penetrating formulation allowing topical delivery deep in the dermis where other topicals can’t reach (patent pending)
Our Market Opportunity
We believe there are significant market opportunities to capture in each of our addressable markets. The table below details the U.S. patient populations for diseases with treatments under development with topical roflumilast cream.

US Patient Populations (Millions) 
 | Psoriasis | Atopic Dermatitis | Seborrheic Dermatitis
Prevalence | 8.6 | 19.2 | 10.0 
Rx treated | 3.5 | 6.3 | 2.7 
Topically treated | 2.5 | 5.4 | 2.7 
Rx treatment in Derm Setting | 2.8 | 1.2 | 1.8 
Rx treated (Topically) in Derm Setting | 2.0 | 1.0 | 1.8 

There are additional large opportunities in diseases that we could potentially treat with ARQ-252 and ARQ-255. The U.S. prevalence for chronic hand eczema, vitiligo, and alopecia areata are approximately 8.3 million, 1.3 million, and 6.2 million patients, respectively.
Topical Roflumilast Cream (ARQ-151)
Our lead product candidate, topical roflumilast cream, has the potential to offer symptomatic improvement similar to the combination of a high potency steroid and calcipotriene, a favorable tolerability profile, the ability to be used chronically, and little to none of the application site reactions associated with many existing topical treatments. Roflumilast cream is designed for simple once-a-day application for chronic use, does not burn or sting on application, and can be used on any part of the body, including sensitive or difficult-to-treat areas, such as the face and intertriginous regions. It quickly and easily rubs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue, does not stain clothing or bedding, or have an unpleasant smell. Roflumilast is a highly potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA for systemic treatment to reduce the risk of exacerbations of COPD in 2011. Roflumilast has demonstrated a potency advantage of approximately 25x to in excess of 300x compared to the active ingredients in the two other FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitors, crisaborole (Eucrisa) and Otezla.
We are currently developing roflumilast cream for plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous psoriasis, as well as atopic dermatitis. We have successfully completed pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as a long-term safety study, in plaque psoriasis, and are currently preparing an NDA, with a submission to the FDA expected in the second half of 2021. In atopic dermatitis, we have completed a Phase 2 proof of concept study and recently initiated Phase 3 clinical trials. The atopic dermatitis Phase 3 program includes 4 studies: two identical studies with approximately 650 subjects each, ages 6 and above (INTEGUMENT-1 and -2); a study with approximately 650 subjects ages 2-5 (INTEGUMENT-PED); and an open label extension study with approximately 400 subjects (INTEGUMENT-OLE). We anticipate topline data from INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 in the second half of 2022.

In July 2018, we executed a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) for exclusive worldwide rights to roflumilast as a topical product in humans solely for dermatological indications. We have built our own intellectual property portfolio around topical uses of roflumilast, with issued and pending formulation, pharmacokinetic, and method-of-use patents in the United States and other jurisdictions from six distinct patent families, which should provide us with exclusivity for our product at least into 2037.
Plaque Psoriasis
Psoriasis Background
Psoriasis is an immune disease that occurs in about two percent of adults in western countries, representing approximately 8.6 million patients in the United States. About 90% of cases are plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by “plaques”, or raised, red areas of skin covered with a silver or white layer of dead skin cells referred to as “scale” (see figures below). Psoriatic plaques can appear on any area of the body, but most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, trunk, and limbs, and the plaques are often itchy and sometimes painful. At least 40% of plaque psoriasis patients have plaques on their scalp, about 15% have plaques in their intertriginous regions, approximately 10% have plaques on their face, and one in three has plaques on their elbows and knees. Each of these areas present a variety of treatment challenges which may be well suited to treatment with topical roflumilast. 
Psoriasis patients are generally characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, with approximately 75% experiencing a mild to moderate form of the disease and 25% experiencing a moderate-to-severe form of the disease. Pruritus (itching) is a particularly common and bothersome symptom for patients, which can be severe and impact sleep patterns. In addition, patients with plaque psoriasis can suffer substantial psychosocial impacts from their disease and have a 50% greater chance of depression than the general population.

Current Psoriasis Treatment Landscape
The vast majority of psoriasis patients are treated with topical therapies, of which there have been no novel treatments approved in over 20 years. Despite their widespread use, existing topical therapies all possess substantial shortcomings:
•Topical steroids are associated with a number of side effects, including, among others, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, skin atrophy (thinning), striae (stretch marks), and telangiectasia (spider veins). Some of these side effects are irreversible. Consequently, high potency topical steroids are not recommended for chronic use, and physicians generally will not prescribe them for treatment on the face or in the intertriginous regions.

•Vitamin D3 analogs provide substantially less symptomatic improvement than high potency steroids, and are frequently irritating. While they can be used chronically, tolerability issues with their use can be a challenge, and physicians generally will not prescribe them for use on the face or in the intertriginous regions.
•Vitamin D3/steroid combinations offer better symptomatic improvement than either of the two individual components alone, but still carry a risk of HPA axis suppression, and are limited in their duration of use. 
Because high potency steroids and combinations containing high potency steroids provide robust symptomatic improvement for psoriasis patients, most physicians initiate treatment for nearly all patients with them. However, due to the limitations on duration of treatment to between two and eight weeks, most physicians will switch the patient to a low- to mid-potency steroid or to a vitamin D analog to manage the patient’s psoriasis patients chronically. These “step down” options provide less symptomatic improvement and are often irritating. Also, rebound is a known challenge with steroids, where psoriasis returns even worse than before steroid treatment. As a result, patients are constantly cycling between effective short courses of high potency steroids and less effective “step down” maintenance treatments.
Treatment with biologics remains highly restricted. In the United States, less than 20% of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients, equivalent to 6% of all psoriasis patients, are on biologic therapy. The uptake of biologics has remained limited due to multiple factors, including the fact that they are indicated only for use in moderate-to-severe patients, their high cost and patient co-pays, reimbursement and access restrictions, perceived risk of side effects, and patient fear of injection.
Treatment with non-biologic systemic therapy, such as methotrexate or Otezla is also limited. According to Decision Resources Group, non-biologic systemic therapy represents approximately 8% of patients worldwide and 11% of patients in the United States. The use of methotrexate has declined due to concerns about side effects and mandatory routine monitoring. Otezla has a limited U.S. market share due to limitations on its use to moderate-to-severe patients, modest symptomatic improvement, and frequent adverse events.
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic Dermatitis Background
Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema, occurring in approximately 6% of the population, representing approximately 19.2 million patients in the United States. Disease onset is most common by 5 years of age, and we estimate that approximately 60% of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis are pediatric patients. Atopic dermatitis is the most common skin disease among children, affecting approximately 15% to 20% of children. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by a defect in the skin barrier, which allows allergens and other irritants to enter the skin, leading to an immune reaction and inflammation. This reaction produces a red, itchy rash, most frequently occurring on the face, arms and legs, and the rash can cover significant areas of the body (see figures below). The rash causes significant pruritus (itching), which can lead to damage caused by scratching or rubbing and perpetuating an ‘itch-scratch’ cycle.

Given that most of the patients are pediatric, safety and tolerability of atopic dermatitis treatments is paramount. Atopic dermatitis imposes a substantial burden on the patient, parents and family. Pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis can suffer from sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, irritability, crying, interference with normal childhood activities, and social functioning. Adults with atopic dermatitis also frequently suffer from sleep disturbances, emotional impacts, and impaired social functioning. Adults with atopic dermatitis also appear to be at a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation compared to the general population.
Current Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Landscape
The vast majority of atopic dermatitis patients are being treated with topical therapies, particularly low- to mid-potency topical steroids and TCIs, and these two classes of drugs constituted nearly all atopic dermatitis prescriptions in 2020. Despite their widespread use, existing topical therapies all possess substantial shortcomings:
•Topical steroids pose a particular concern in pediatric patients due to the risk of systemic absorption, and the consequent risk of HPA axis suppression and potential developmental problems. Chronic use of topical steroids in atopic dermatitis patients is generally avoided. Many physicians are also reluctant to use steroids to treat atopic dermatitis on the face due to the increased risk of glaucoma and cataracts, or the diaper/groin region due to risk of skin thinning. There is also considerable concern among many parents about treating their children with steroids.
•Topical calcineurin inhibitors are generally seen as providing less symptomatic improvement than topical steroids and are also associated with some application site burning. In 2005 the FDA placed a boxed warning on the labels of both TCIs regarding a potential increased risk of cancers, especially lymphomas, associated with their use, which often creates significant parental resistance to their use.
•Eucrisa is a topical non-steroidal PDE4 inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2016. Despite initial interest among the physician community to adopt the product, its growth has been hampered by modest symptomatic improvement, frequent occurrences of application site burning and stinging, and disadvantaged reimbursement status compared to other atopic dermatitis treatments.

Topical Roflumilast Cream Clinical Development
Plaque Psoriasis
    We have successfully completed the pivotal clinical studies of topical roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis, and are currently preparing the NDA for submission with the FDA. We intend to use the results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2, supported by the chronic treatment results from the ARQ-151-202 and DERMIS-OLE studies, to support recommendations for long-term use. Safety data from DERMIS-1, DERMIS-2 and Study ARQ-151-202, supplemented with data from Studies ARQ-151-201, ARQ-154-204, DERMIS-OLE, and other studies, will form the basis for our Integrated Safety Summary that will be required by the FDA at the time of submission.
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-151-301 and 302 (DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 pivotal Phase 3 studies)
The DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 studies were identical pivotal Phase 3 randomized, parallel, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-national, multi-center studies in which subjects age 2 years and above with mild, moderate or severe chronic plaque psoriasis involving between 2% and 20% body surface area received 8 weeks of (i) roflumilast cream 0.3% once daily or (ii) matching vehicle once daily. DERMIS-1 enrolled 439 subjects and DERMIS-2 enrolled 442 subjects.
Results from the eight-week treatment period demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to the matching vehicle on key efficacy endpoints. On the studies’ primary efficacy endpoint of percentage of patients achieving Investigator Global Assessment (“IGA”) success, which was defined as a score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at week 8, 42.4% of patients treated with roflumilast cream achieved IGA Success, compared to 6.1% of patients treated with vehicle (p < 0.0001) in DERMIS-1, and 37.5% of patients treated with roflumilast cream achieved IGA Success, compared to 6.9% of patients treated with vehicle (p<0.0001) in DERMIS-2. Roflumilast cream also demonstrated statistically significant improvements over vehicle on key secondary endpoints, including on Intertriginous IGA Success, Psoriasis Area Severity Index-75, reductions in itch as measured by the Worst Itch-Numerical Rating Scale, and patient perceptions of symptoms as measured by the Psoriasis Symptoms Diary (PSD).
Roflumilast cream was well-tolerated by the patient populations, with rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) low and similar to vehicle, with most TEAEs assessed as mild to moderate in severity. Of the patients treated with roflumilast cream, five patients (1.7% of subjects) in DERMIS-1 and one patient (0.3% of subjects) in DERMIS-2 discontinued the study due to a TEAE. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events
ARQ-151-202 (Long-Term Safety Study)
The long-term safety study was a Phase 2, multi-center, open label study of the long-term safety and efficacy of roflumilast cream 0.3% in adult subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis involving up to 25% total body surface area (BSA), evaluated in two cohorts: subjects who completed the ARQ-151-201 Phase 2b, randomized, controlled trial; and previously untreated subjects. All subjects applied roflumilast cream 0.3% once daily for 52 weeks at home. Approximately half (164 out of 332) of the subjects entered this long-term study after completing treatment with roflumilast cream 0.3% or 0.15% in the randomized Phase 2b study (ARQ-151-201) and therefore received up to 64 weeks of total treatment with roflumilast cream (12 weeks in the randomized Phase 2b study and 52 weeks in the long-term safety study). Periodic clinic visits included assessments for clinical safety, application site reactions, and disease improvement or progression. The primary outcome measures of this long-term safety study were the occurrence of TEAEs and the occurrence of serious adverse events.
Index to Financial Statements

In this open label study, roflumilast cream 0.3% applied once daily for up to 52 weeks demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability over the long-term treatment period, consistent with what was seen in the randomized Phase 2b study, with only 3.6% of patients experiencing a treatment-related adverse event during 52 weeks of treatment. At week 52 of the long-term safety study, 44.8% of all subjects attained an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clear or almost clear, with 34.8% of subjects in Cohort 1 and 39.5% of subjects in Cohort 2 achieving IGA Success, defined as a score of clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline. Additionally, of the subjects in the 12 week randomized Phase 2b study who were treated with roflumilast cream 0.3%, and who attained an IGA of clear or almost clear at 12 weeks in the first study, then continued on treatment in the long-term safety study, 66.7% had an IGA of clear or almost clear at the end of 64 weeks of treatment or their last visit. Of the 332 subjects in this study, 73.5% completed the full 52 weeks of open label treatment, with only 3.9% of subjects discontinuing the study due to an adverse event and less than 1% of subjects discontinuing due to lack of efficacy. There were no treatment related serious adverse events reported.
ARQ-151-201 (Phase 2b Study)
ARQ-151-201 was a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study, in which 331 adults with plaque psoriasis covering between 2% and 20% BSA were randomized to receive 12 weeks of: (1) roflumilast cream 0.3%, (2) roflumilast cream 0.15%, or (3) matching vehicle. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, patients were eligible to roll over into our ARQ-151-202 open label extension study for an additional 52 weeks. Completion rates for the study were 93.6% in the roflumilast cream 0.3% arm, 92.0% in the roflumilast cream 0.15% arm, and 78.9% in the vehicle arm.
On the study’s primary endpoint, roflumilast cream produced statistically significant reductions compared to vehicle (roflumilast cream 0.3%: p<0.001, roflumilast cream 0.15%: p = 0.004) in the signs of plaque psoriasis, as measured by an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear”, after 6 weeks of once daily treatment, and was very well-tolerated with minimal adverse events in the study population. On one of the study’s secondary endpoints, roflumilast cream 0.3% had an IGA Success (clear/almost clear + 2-grade improvement from baseline) rate of 32.2%, and roflumilast cream 0.15% had an IGA Success rate of 24.5% compared to a vehicle IGA Success rate of 9.8% (roflumilast cream 0.3%: p<0.001, roflumilast cream 0.15%: p = 0.005) after 8 weeks of once daily application. Roflumilast cream 0.3% also separated statistically from vehicle on all secondary endpoints, including reductions in Intertriginous IGA (I-IGA), Psoriasis Area Severity Index, reductions in itch as measured by the Worst Itch-Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS), and patient perceptions of symptoms as measured by the Psoriasis Symptoms Diary, and roflumilast cream 0.15% separated statistically from vehicle on all secondary endpoints except for I-IGA.
In this study, roflumilast cream was very well-tolerated in this population. The incidence of TEAEs was low and similar between active treatment and vehicle, with nearly all TEAEs mild to moderate in severity. Among subjects receiving roflumilast cream, there was only one discontinuation due to a TEAE (< 1% of subjects) and two Serious Adverse Events (neither related to drug).
Key Ongoing Trials
ARQ-151-306 (DERMIS-OLE) Study
A portion of subjects who completed 8 weeks of double-blind treatment in the DERMIS-1 and DERMIS-2 studies were eligible to roll over to the ongoing open label extension study, DERMIS-OLE. In this study, up to 250 subjects will be enrolled and all subjects receive roflumilast cream 0.3% for 24 weeks. The primary endpoints of this study are the occurrence of TEAEs and the occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).

Atopic Dermatitis
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-151-212
The most recent study completed with roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis was a multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled proof of concept Phase 2 study, in which 136 adolescents (ages 12 and above) and adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis involving between 1.5% and 35% BSA were randomized to receive once daily topical applications for 4 weeks of: (1) roflumilast cream 0.15%, or (2) roflumilast cream 0.05%, or (3) vehicle. The goals of this small proof of concept study were to establish whether roflumilast cream provides a signal of potential symptomatic improvement in atopic dermatitis patients, as well as to gain an understanding of its tolerability. Completion rates for the study were 98% in the roflumilast cream 0.15% arm, 91% in the roflumilast cream 0.05% arm, and 93% in the vehicle arm.
On the study's primary endpoint, the absolute change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score after 4 weeks of once daily treatment, neither dose reached statistical significance versus vehicle, although roflumilast cream 0.15% showed a trend towards significance, with a mean improvement of 6.4 in patients treated with roflumilast cream 0.15% compared to 4.8 in patients treated with vehicle (p = 0.097). On the secondary endpoint of mean percent change from baseline on EASI, roflumilast cream 0.15% demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus vehicle (72.3% versus 55.8%, p = 0.049). Efficacy was also observed at both doses as measured by EASI-75 (roflumilast cream 0.05%: 59.1% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.009 and roflumilast cream 0.15%: 52.3% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.045). On the Validated Investigator Global Assessment - Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD), roflumilast cream 0.15% also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement versus vehicle in the percentage of patients achieving clear or almost clear (roflumilast cream 0.15%: 52.3% versus vehicle: 31.1%, p = 0.040). 
In this study, both doses of roflumilast cream were well-tolerated. 95% of subjects on active treatment completed the full study. The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs and application site reactions were low (< 5%) and similar between active treatment and vehicle. All TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Among subjects receiving roflumilast cream, there was only one SAE, which was unrelated to treatment, and only one discontinuation due to a TEAE.
We believe the consistent evidence of improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms demonstrated by both strengths of roflumilast cream across multiple endpoints, as well as the magnitude of improvement demonstrated on both doses in this small proof-of-concept study, demonstrate the ability of roflumilast cream to effectively treat atopic dermatitis. Additionally, this study provided valuable insights into the safety and tolerability of roflumilast cream in this population, an especially important consideration because the majority of atopic dermatitis sufferers are young children. While the study did not reach statistical significance on every endpoint, the consistency of evidence for improvement in atopic dermatitis, coupled with favorable tolerability data, provides us with the confidence to continue the development of roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis. 
Key Ongoing and Upcoming Trials
The atopic dermatitis Phase 3 program includes four studies. INTEGUMENT-1 and -2, which have been initiated, are multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies, in approximately 650 subjects in each study, ages 6 and above with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Subjects will be randomized to receive once daily topical applications for 4 weeks of roflumilast cream 0.15%, or vehicle. The primary endpoint is the proportion of all randomized subjects who attain IGA Success, defined as a vIGA-AD score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ plus a 2-grade improvement from Baseline at Week 4. We anticipate topline data from INTEGUMENT-1 and -2 in the second half of 2022. Sharing a similar overall design, INTEGUMENT-PED is a multi-center, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 study in approximately 650 subjects ages 2-5 with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Subjects will be randomized to receive once daily topical application for 4 weeks of roflumilast cream 0.05%, or vehicle and the primary endpoint will also be IGA Success at week 4. INTEGUMENT-OLE is an open label extension study that will enroll approximately 400 subjects who have completed INTEGUMENT-1, -2, or -PED. Subjects will be treated for up to 52 weeks and the primary endpoint are the occurrence of TEAEs and SAEs.

Topical Roflumilast Foam
We are also developing a topical foam formulation of roflumilast for the treatment of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. Topical roflumilast foam contains the same highly potent and selective PDE4 inhibitor found in topical roflumilast cream, and is nearly identical to topical roflumilast cream, with all ingredients in the foam being the same as those in the cream, other than reduced oil content and the addition of a propellant in the can to create the foam. Roflumilast foam is a light foam, similar to hair mousse, that has been designed to deliver the drug to the scalp while not leaving a greasy residue or disturbing hair style. The foam breaks easily upon agitation, creating a thin solution that can be rubbed easily into the scalp. Additionally, the product does not melt on the fingers prior to application. Roflumilast foam will not stain clothing or bedding, and does not have an unpleasant smell. Roflumilast foam is designed for simple once-a-day application and neither burns nor stings on application. 
We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of roflumilast foam in seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis, demonstrating promising efficacy and tolerability in both diseases. We believe that roflumilast foam may offer physicians and patients a highly differentiated clinical profile that is ideally suited to address unmet needs in the topical treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
Seborrheic Dermatitis Background
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that is estimated to occur in approximately 2% of the population. The disease causes red patches covered with large, greasy, flaking yellow-gray scales, and is frequently itchy. It appears most often on the scalp, face (especially on the nose, eyebrows, ears, and eyelids), upper chest, and back as depicted in the figure below. A milder variant of the disease is dandruff. While the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis is not well understood, some experts believe a contributor is an over-abundance of Malassezia, a naturally occurring yeast found on normal skin but found in excess numbers on skin with seborrheic dermatitis. There also is an immunological or inflammatory component, possibly as a result of the proliferation of the Malassezia yeast and its elaboration of substances that irritate the skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur in both adults and infants, and in infants is commonly referred to as “cradle cap”.
Figures: Seborrheic Dermatitis
Current Seborrheic Dermatitis Treatment Landscape
There are a number of widely used treatments for seborrheic dermatitis, including antifungal agents, lower potency steroids, and immunomodulators.
•Antifungal agents, particularly azoles such as ketoconazole, are the cornerstone of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis. These agents are available in a variety of topical formulations, and oral antifungals are occasionally used in very severe cases. Antifungals in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis are generally well-tolerated, although some patients experience irritant contact dermatitis, a burning or itching sensation, or dryness.
•Topical steroids, mostly low- to mid-potency, are often prescribed for patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis because of the inflammatory component of the disease. Due to the risks associated with steroid use, particularly on the face, physicians try to limit duration or avoid steroid therapy. 
Index to Financial Statements

•TCIs are also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. These agents appear to provide symptomatic improvement in seborrheic dermatitis due to their anti-inflammatory effects. As previously noted, TCIs carry a boxed warning for the potential increased risk of cancers, especially lymphomas, associated with their use, and physicians generally try to avoid long-term use in patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, TCIs only provide symptomatic improvement in seborrheic dermatitis in areas of skin that are very thin and where the drug can penetrate (i.e., largely the periocular areas only).
While physicians have a number of relatively inexpensive treatment options that provide symptomatic improvement for seborrheic dermatitis, the greatest unmet need relates to inadequate response to existing therapies in some patients, particularly in patients with more severe disease. Physicians report that up to one-third of severe patients suffering from seborrheic dermatitis, and a smaller percentage of mild- and moderate-severity patients, have an inadequate response to current seborrheic dermatitis treatments. Additionally, physicians are wary of using steroids on the face due to the risk of skin thinning, spider veins, folliculitis, and unnatural hair growth. Physicians are especially wary of using steroids near the eyes due to the potential increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma. Finally, many physicians are reluctant to treat chronically with steroids and TCIs, the main anti-inflammatory agents used in treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. 
We believe topical roflumilast foam may present a unique dual mechanism of action to treat patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Based on clinical data to date across indications, topical roflumilast has demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, a recent preclinical study demonstrated that roflumilast foam may also possess anti-fungal effects, specifically against Malassezia, the fungus implicated in seborrheic dermatitis. Because the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis potentially includes both a fungal overgrowth component and an inflammatory component, roflumilast foam’s putative dual mechanism of action may provide symptomatic improvement for patients not achieving suitable responses from currently available therapies. In addition to the opportunity in treatment resistant patients, we believe roflumilast foam may be an option for some patients as a first-line therapy, especially patients with involvement of the face where other therapies are contraindicated.
Scalp Psoriasis
Scalp Psoriasis Background
Scalp psoriasis is a manifestation of plaque psoriasis that occurs in nearly half of all psoriasis patients, characterized by plaques in the hair-bearing area of the scalp and sometimes extending to the forehead, back of the neck, or behind or inside the ears as depicted in the figure below. These psoriatic plaques are identical to plaques on other body areas, however topical treatment of these plaques is complicated by the difficulty of delivering topical drugs under hair-bearing areas. As with psoriatic plaques on other parts of the body, psoriasis on the scalp is often itchy and is sometimes painful. Scalp psoriasis can also be associated with hair loss, likely due to damage to the hair from excessive scratching, rubbing, or combing of the affected area.

Current Scalp Psoriasis Treatment Landscape
Scalp psoriasis treatments are similar to plaque psoriasis treatments, given that the plaques are identical to the plaques in other body areas. Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis include TCS, vitamin D analogs, or the combination, in a topical formulation suitable for hair-bearing areas, such as shampoos, solutions, or foams. However, many of the current topical formulations for hair-bearing areas are poorly formulated and are not well-received by patients. Existing topical treatments for the scalp also suffer from the same efficacy, safety, tolerability and patient acceptability issues as existing creams and ointments. While both biologics and systemic treatments will improve scalp psoriasis, they suffer from the same limitations on their use as in plaque psoriasis. 
Topical Roflumilast Foam Clinical Development
We have successfully completed Phase 2 studies of roflumilast foam in seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. In seborrheic dermatitis, we had a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and plan to initiate a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the second or third quarter of 2021, with topline data expected in the second or third quarter of 2022. Pending discussions with regulators, we expect to initiate our Phase 3 program in scalp psoriasis in the second half of 2021, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2022.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
Key Completed Trials 
ARQ-154-203 (Phase 2 Study)
Study ARQ-154-203 enrolled 226 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe seborrheic dermatitis. This 8-week, multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam 0.3% administered once daily to affected areas on the scalp, face, and body. 
Roflumilast foam 0.3% administered once daily for 8 weeks demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to a matching vehicle foam on key efficacy endpoints in subjects with moderate-to-severe seborrheic dermatitis. On the study’s primary endpoint assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved an IGA Success rate of 73.8% compared to a vehicle rate of 40.9% (p<0.0001). IGA Success is defined as the achievement of an IGA score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ on a 5-grade scale plus at least a two-point change from baseline. The onset of effect was rapid, with roflumilast foam statistically separating from vehicle as early as week 2, the first visit after baseline, on IGA Success as well as multiple secondary endpoints. For example, at week 8, 64.6% of subjects treated with roflumilast foam who had a baseline WI-NRS score of 4 achieved an itch reduction of at least 4 points compared to 34.0% of vehicle treated subjects (p=0.0007). Other secondary endpoints included overall assessment of erythema and overall assessment of scaling, which also had positive outcomes. 
Importantly, roflumilast foam was well-tolerated, with rates of application site adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events low and similar to vehicle. Only 2 out of 154 subjects (1.3%) treated with roflumilast foam discontinued the study due to an adverse event, compared to 1 out of 72 subjects (1.4%) treated with the vehicle.
Key Ongoing and Upcoming Trials 
ARQ-154-214 (Long-Term Safety)
Study ARQ-154-214 is an ongoing multi-center, open label Phase 2 long-term safety study of roflumilast foam 0.3% applied once daily in patients with seborrheic dermatitis. This study includes patients who were treated previously in the Phase 2 trial (ARQ-154-203), as well as patients naive to treatment with roflumilast foam. Periodic clinic visits will include assessments for clinical safety, application site reactions, and disease improvement, or progression.
ARQ-154-304 (Phase 3 Study)
The Phase 3 program will consist of a single pivotal trial, which we anticipate initiating in the second or third quarter of 2021, with topline data expected in the second or third quarter of 2022.

Scalp Psoriasis
Key Completed Trials
ARQ-154-204 (Phase 2b Study)
Study ARQ-154-204 was a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study, in which 304 adolescents (ages 12 and above) and adults with scalp psoriasis covering at least 10% of the total scalp involvement and up to 25% of total psoriasis involvement in all body areas were randomized to receive 8 weeks of (1) roflumilast foam 0.3% once daily, or (2) matching vehicle once daily. Randomization was 2:1, active to vehicle. The primary endpoint of the trial was achievement of a Scalp IGA (S-IGA) scale score of “clear” or “almost clear” plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline, or S-IGA, at week 8. Multiple secondary endpoints were also evaluated. 
Roflumilast foam demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to a matching vehicle foam on key efficacy endpoints. On the study’s primary endpoint of S-IGA Success assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved a rate of 59.1% compared to a vehicle rate of 11.4% (p<0.0001). Onset was rapid, with significantly higher rates of S-IGA Success noted as early as 2 weeks.
Multiple secondary endpoints were also met. On the key secondary endpoint of Body Investigator Global Assessment (B-IGA) success assessed at week 8, roflumilast foam 0.3% achieved a rate of 40.3% compared to a vehicle rate of 6.8% (p<0.0001), with separation from vehicle on B-IGA Success as early as 2 weeks. Symptomatic improvement was also demonstrated, with 71.0% of subjects treated with roflumilast foam 0.3% who had a baseline Scalp Itch Numeric Rating Scale score of 4 or greater achieving an itch reduction of at least 4 points at week 8 compared to 18.5% of vehicle treated subjects (p<0.0001).
Consistent with other clinical trials of topical roflumilast, roflumilast foam was well-tolerated, as evidenced by subject-reported local tolerability and rates of application site adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events low and similar to vehicle. Only 5 out of 200 subjects (2.5%) in the roflumilast foam treated group discontinued the study due to an adverse event, compared to 2 out of 104 subjects (1.9%) treated with the vehicle.
ARQ-252
ARQ-252 is topical cream formulation of a potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of JAK1 that we are developing for chronic hand eczema and vitiligo. In a preclinical study, ARQ-252 proved to be highly selective to JAK1 over JAK2, in contrast to ruxolitinib, the furthest advanced topical Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor in U.S. development. We believe that due to its high selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2, ARQ-252 has the potential to treat inflammatory diseases without causing the hematopoietic adverse effects associated with JAK2 inhibition. As the only JAK1-selective topical in development, we believe that ARQ-252 could offer a best-in-class topical JAK inhibitor, with a more favorable safety and tolerability profile than other topical JAK inhibitors due to its selectivity to JAK1 over JAK2, robust symptomatic improvement due to its high potency against JAK1, and a convenient and patient-friendly cream formulation.
We have completed enrollment in a Phase 2b clinical study for the treatment of chronic hand eczema with ARQ-252, and expect topline data in mid-2021. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept study of ARQ-252 for the treatment of vitiligo in the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, we have formulation and preclinical efforts underway for ARQ-255, an alternative topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata.
In December 2019, we exercised our exclusive option under our Hengrui License Agreement to exclusively license the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ARQ-252 for all topical dermatological uses in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. (Hengrui) is developing SHR-0302, the active ingredient in ARQ-252, for the oral treatment of various inflammatory and immunological disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, and has completed a Phase 2b study in rheumatoid arthritis. Under our agreement, we have the right to reference their safety data, along with the systemic toxicology data supporting their program. Hengrui has built strong intellectual property protection around the active ingredient in ARQ-252, and holds U.S. composition of matter patents, including patents for the bisulfate form of the active ingredient that do not begin to expire until 2033. We believe there is the potential for additional intellectual property protection of ARQ-252 through possible future formulation and other patents.

Chronic Hand Eczema
Eczema is a term used to describe a group of different diseases that cause the skin to become red, itchy and inflamed. There are multiple forms of eczema, including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, hand eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis. Eczema is very common, with some estimates that up to 30 million people in the United States may have some form of eczema.
Hand eczema is a common, predominantly inflammatory, skin disease characterized variously by redness, fluid filled blisters or bumps, scaling, cracking, itching and pain occurring on the hands, especially the palms (see figures below). It is the most common skin disease affecting the hands, with prevalence estimated at up to 2.5% of the population. The impact of hand eczema on patients can be significant, leading to work absences or disability, social stigmatization, and psychosocial distress.
Figures: Hand Eczema
Current Hand Eczema Treatment Landscape
Hand eczema is a difficult disease to treat. The palms of the hand have skin that can be up to ten times thicker than skin from other body areas, which inhibits drug absorption and the ability to deliver drugs topically. Hand eczema is typically treated with high potency topical steroids, mostly due to the aforementioned skin barrier challenges. In some cases, physicians also will incorporate barrier creams to aid in hydration and to prevent the irritant effect caused by occupational exposure, a common cause of hand eczema. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for the indication of hand eczema. However, LEO Pharma has demonstrated proof of concept for their topical JAK inhibitor, delgocitinib, in Phase 2 studies. Physicians report that a significant percentage of patients, including up to 40% of patients with severe dyshidrotic eczema (one type of hand eczema), have an inadequate response to currently available treatments. In those who respond to high potency topical steroids, skin atrophy becomes a problem with chronic use, even on the thick skin of the palms. 
Vitiligo
Vitiligo is a chronic and disfiguring autoimmune disease that causes the complete loss of skin color in blotches or patches, frequently in a symmetrical distribution, and has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The disease is caused by the localized destruction by the immune system of melanocytes, the skin cells that produce the skin pigment melanin, resulting in complete depigmentation in the affected area. 
Vitiligo can have profound psychological impact on patients, particularly those with skin of color. Patients may feel loss of self-esteem and experience stigmatization. At this point in time, there are no FDA-approved treatments for vitiligo, so patients are often treated with off-label combinations of steroids, TCIs, ultraviolet light and lasers. As such, there is great unmet need for therapies that are more effective and less limiting than currently available treatment modalities.

ARQ-252 Clinical Development
Chronic Hand Eczema
ARQ-252-205 Study (Phase 2b Study)
We have completed enrollment in the ARQ-252-205 Study. This study is a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study, in which approximately 215 adults with chronic hand eczema were randomized to receive: (1) 0.1% ARQ-252 cream applied once daily, or (2) 0.3% ARQ-252 cream applied once daily, or (3) 0.3% ARQ-252 cream applied twice daily, or (4) matching vehicle cream applied once or twice daily, all for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is IGA Success, defined as an IGA of “clear” or “almost clear” plus at least a 2-point improvement from baseline at week 12. We expect to report topline data by mid-2021.
Vitiligo
ARQ-252-213 Study (Phase 2a Study)
We expect to initiate enrollment in the ARQ-252-213 study in the first quarter of 2021. This Phase 2a study is a parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of ARQ-252 0.3% cream either with or without narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) phototherapy treatment in approximately 500 subjects with non-segmental facial vitiligo. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects achieving Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index-75 (F-VASI-75), which is ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in F-VASI at week 24.
ARQ-255
We are also developing ARQ-255, an alternative topical formulation of ARQ-252 designed to reach deeper into the skin in order to potentially treat alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to incorrectly attack the body’s own cells, specifically the hair follicles, leading to loss of hair—usually in patches—on the scalp, face or sometimes other areas of the body. While oral JAK inhibitors have shown symptomatic improvement in the treatment of alopecia areata, multiple topically applied JAK inhibitors have failed to demonstrate symptomatic improvement in alopecia areata. It is our belief that this discrepancy is due to the site of inflammation driving alopecia areata, deep in the skin at the base (bulb) of the hair follicle. While oral JAK inhibitor administration can achieve required levels of drug at the site of inflammation, conventional topical applications are unlikely to deliver concentrations of JAK inhibitors to the site of inflammation adequate to treat alopecia areata. We have undertaken a formulation effort we refer to as Deep Dermal Drug Delivery (“4D” technology), that leverages some of the unique physical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ARQ-255, and which we believe may allow us to topically deliver sufficient concentrations of the drug to potentially treat alopecia areata via topical administration. Formulation and preclinical experiments are underway to develop a 4D version of ARQ-252, which we refer to as ARQ-255, and if those formulation efforts are successful, we plan to enter the clinic with ARQ-255 as a potential treatment for alopecia areata.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and is characterized by rapid and significant changes, intense competition and a bias towards proprietary products. We will face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and generic drug companies. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments, including those that may have achieved broad market acceptance, and any new treatment that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that offer more symptomatic improvement, have a lower risk of side effects or are less costly than our current or future product candidates.
Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates that have a lower risk of side effects and/or provide more symptomatic improvement than competing products.

Commercial Operations
We intend to build our own commercial infrastructure in the United States and Canada to support the commercialization of our product candidates. We intend to begin building this commercial infrastructure if and when we believe that a regulatory approval of our first product candidate appears reasonably likely. We plan to build our own small specialty sales force targeted at dermatologists, with approximately 100 field-based staff needed to market to US dermatologists. We may seek partnerships that allow us to target pediatricians and primary care physicians if required to maximize the potential of our product candidates. We also plan to build the required sales management, marketing, access and reimbursement, sales support, and distribution capabilities to optimize our commercial success. To develop the required commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest substantial financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that our product candidates will be approved, and we could invest resources and then later learn that a particular product candidate is not being approved. We may also seek other partners to help us access other geographic markets.
Intellectual Property
Maintaining proprietary rights in our product candidates and technologies will assist in achieving the success of our business. One way in which we obtain and maintain such proprietary rights is by filing patent applications and maintaining patents covering our core technologies and product candidates. Our policy is to file such patent applications in the United States and select foreign countries to better protect our worldwide interests. We also seek to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. For this reason, we routinely monitor and evaluate third-party patents and publications, and, if necessary, take appropriate action based on that evaluation.
Patent term is based on the filing or grant date of the patent, as well as the governing law of the country in which the patent is obtained. In the United States, some pharmaceutical patents are also eligible for Patent Term Extension, or PTE, which can extend exclusivity for up to 5 additional years under certain conditions. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country.
As of February 16, 2021, we own or have an exclusive license to ten issued U.S. patents and eight issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various European Union (EU) member states, and five pending U.S. patent applications, 15 pending foreign patent applications and two applications filed under the Patent Corporation Treaty. Of these patents and patent applications:
•Roflumilast cream & roflumilast foam:    As of February 16, 2021, we own five issued U.S. patents, one issued Canadian patent, one issued Japanese patent, one issued Chinese patent, seven pending U.S. patent applications and 39 pending foreign applications (two each in Hong Kong and Canada; three each in Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, India, Australia, Europe, Israel, and Brazil, China, Korea and Eurasia; and two under the Patent Cooperation Treaty), relating to roflumilast cream and roflumilast foam. The issued U.S. patent that we have licensed from AstraZeneca claiming a composition of matter encompassing roflumilast, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in roflumilast cream and roflumilast foam, expired on January 27, 2020. Data exclusivity for oral roflumilast expired on January 23, 2021. Our issued patents relating to roflumilast cream and roflumilast foam contain claims directed to, among other things, formulating roflumilast in combination with hexylene glycol, methods of making such formulations and methods of treatment using such formulations. These issued U.S. patents relating to roflumilast cream and roflumilast foam will expire not earlier than June 2037 (excluding any potential PTE). Our pending patents relating to roflumilast cream and roflumilast foam contain claims directed to, among other things, other aspects of our roflumilast formulations, as well as unique pharmacokinetic aspects of topical roflumilast.

The issued patents and pending applications, if issued, relating to SHR0302 will not begin to expire until 2033. We anticipate filing patent applications directed towards formulations, methods and other aspects of our technology relating to ARQ-252 and ARQ-255 which we may develop in the future.
Obtaining patent protection is not the only method that we employ to protect our propriety rights. We also utilize other forms of intellectual property protection, including trademark, and trade secrets, when those other forms are better suited to protect a particular aspect of our intellectual property. Our belief is that our propriety rights are strengthened by our comprehensive approach to intellectual property protection.
Maintaining the confidential nature of our non-publicly disclosed products and technologies is of paramount importance. For this reason, our employees, contractors, consultants and advisors are required to enter into nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements when their employment or engagement commences. Those individuals also enter into agreements that prohibit the communication or implementation of any third-party proprietary rights during the course of their employment with us. We also require any third-party that may receive our confidential information or materials to enter into confidentiality agreements prior to receipt of that information or material.
Exclusive License and Option Agreements
AstraZeneca
In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the AstraZeneca License Agreement, with AstraZeneca, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, under certain AstraZeneca-controlled patent rights, know-how and regulatory documentation, to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit products containing roflumilast in topical forms, as well as delivery systems sold with or for the administration of roflumilast, or collectively, the AZ-Licensed Products, for all diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses for human dermatological indications, or the Dermatology Field. We intend to develop topical formulations of roflumilast for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatological conditions. Under this agreement, we have sole responsibility for development, regulatory, and commercialization activities for the AZ-Licensed Products in the Dermatology Field, at our expense, and we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, and commercialize the AZ-Licensed Products in the Dermatology Field in each of the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, AstraZeneca provided us with certain quantities of roflumilast at a negotiated price for development purposes.
We paid AstraZeneca an upfront non-refundable cash payment of $1.0 million and issued 484,388 shares of our Series B Preferred stock, valued at $3.0 million on the date of the AstraZeneca License Agreement. We subsequently paid AstraZeneca the first milestone cash payment of $2.0 million upon the completion of a Phase 2b study of roflumilast cream in plaque psoriasis in August 2019 for the achievement of positive Phase 2 data for an AZ-Licensed Product. We have agreed to make additional cash payments to AstraZeneca of up to an aggregate of $12.5 million upon the achievement of specific regulatory approval milestones with respect to the AZ-Licensed Products and payments up to an additional aggregate amount of $15.0 million upon the achievement of certain aggregate worldwide net sales milestones. With respect to any AZ-Licensed Products we commercialize under the AstraZeneca License Agreement, we will pay AstraZeneca a low to high single-digit percentage royalty rate on our, our affiliates’ and our sublicensees’ net sales of such AZ-Licensed Products, until, as determined on a AZ-Licensed Product-by-AZ-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, the later of the date of the expiration of the last-to-expire AstraZeneca-licensed patent right containing a valid claim in such country and ten years from the first commercial sale of such AZ-Licensed Product in such country.

The agreement continues in effect until the expiration of all royalty obligations as described above, unless earlier terminated: (1) by either party upon written notice for the other party’s material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within specified time periods; (2) by AstraZeneca if we, our affiliates, or our sublicensees take actions to invalidate AstraZeneca-licensed patent rights, or if we permanently cease development of all AZ-Licensed Products, and an AZ-Licensed Product is not being commercialized by us; or (3) by us upon 120 days’ written notice or in the event of certain adverse clinical trial or other regulatory outcomes. In the event the agreement is terminated, except by us for AstraZeneca’s material breach or in the event of certain adverse clinical trial or other regulatory outcomes, we will be obligated to pay a termination fee in the amount of $5.0 million or 3% of net sales of AZ-Licensed Products for the 3-year period following the first regulatory approval of an AZ-Licensed Product, whichever is greater.
Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement, or the Hengrui License Agreement, with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd, or Hengrui, whereby Hengrui granted us an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize products containing the compound designated by Hengrui as SHR0302, a JAK inhibitor, in topical formulations for the treatment of skin diseases, disorders, and conditions, or the Field, in the United States, Japan, and the EU (including for clarity the United Kingdom), or the Territory.
In December 2019, we exercised our exclusive option, and also contemporaneously amended the agreement to expand the territory to additionally include Canada, and therefore now have a license from Hengrui under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by Hengrui to research, develop and commercialize products containing SHR0302 in the Field in the Territory. Such license is sublicensable through multiple tiers, exclusive as to the patent rights licensed from Hengrui and nonexclusive with respect to the know-how licensed from Hengrui, and does not extend to patent rights for improvements to SHR0302 which Hengrui may come to control in the future unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. In addition, we have sole responsibility for development, regulatory, marketing and commercialization activities to be conducted for the licensed products in the Field and in the Territory, at our sole cost and discretion, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) develop at least one licensed product and to (2) commercialize the licensed products following regulatory approval thereof. Pursuant to the Hengrui License Agreement, a joint coordination committee reviews the progress of development and commercialization of each parties’ products containing SHR0302 in their respective territories and fields.
During the term of the Hengrui License Agreement, if we acquire or develop certain JAK inhibitor products that are not controlled by Hengrui, or Competing Products, we must negotiate in good faith with Hengrui whether to terminate the agreement or license to Hengrui the right to develop and commercialize such Competing Product in China. During the term of the Hengrui License Agreement, Hengrui will not develop or commercialize SHR0302 or any licensed product in the Field in the Territory. Additionally, if Hengrui decides to develop or commercialize a non-topical formulation of SHR0302 for the treatment of certain dermatologic indications in the Territory, we have the first right to negotiate a co-development and/or co-commercialization agreement with Hengrui for the same. We also have the right of first refusal if Hengrui decides to out-license a non-topical formulation of SHR0302 for the treatment of certain dermatologic indications in the Territory to a third-party during such period.
We made a $0.4 million upfront non-refundable cash payment to Hengrui upon execution of the Hengrui License Agreement option and license agreement. We also made a $1.5 million cash payment in connection with the exercise of our exclusive option. In addition, we have agreed to make cash payments of up to an aggregate of $20.5 million upon our achievement of specified clinical development and regulatory approval milestones with respect to the licensed products and cash payments of up to an additional $200.0 million in sales-based milestones based on achieving certain aggregate annual net sales volumes with respect to a licensed product. With respect to any products we commercialize under the agreement, we will pay tiered royalties to Hengrui on net sales of each licensed product by us, or our affiliates, or our sublicensees, ranging from mid single-digit to sub-teen percentage rates based on tiered annual net sales bands subject to specified reductions. We are obligated to pay royalties until the later of (1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in such country and (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Hengrui a specified percentage, ranging from the low-thirties to the sub-teens, of certain non-royalty sublicensing income we receive from sublicensees of our rights to the licensed products, such percentage decreasing as the development stage of the licensed products advance.

The agreement continues in effect until the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties as described above, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the following: (1) by either party upon written notice for the other party’s material breach or insolvency event if such party fails to cure such breach or the insolvency event is not dismissed within specified time periods; and (2) by us for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice to Hengrui and having discussed and consulted any potential cause or concern with Hengrui in good faith.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other governmental authorities. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, quality control, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing, and control, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
Index to Financial Statements

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, such as where the study is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the additional information must be included in any resubmitted NDA, which is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of receipt of a standard NDA for a product that is not a new molecular entity, or NME, and six months from the date of receipt for an NDA for a non-NME subject to priority review, to review and act on the submission. In the case of an NME, the six and ten month review periods are measured from the date on which the FDA “files” the NDA rather than the date on which the NDA is received by the FDA. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
Index to Financial Statements

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter, which states that the application will not be approved in present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and approved product labeling may contain certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, including Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess a drug’s safety after approval. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Certain changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of these clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority review applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
Index to Financial Statements

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA. In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten year period. The DSCSA requires product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. However, a drug must meet certain criteria relative to the Listed Drug to be eligible to use the Section 505(b)(2) pathway as opposed to the abbreviated NDA, or ANDA pathway, which is described below. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA generally provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are 
Index to Financial Statements

termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
Upon submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the applicant must certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.
The application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes a period of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept for review) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon NDA approval of a drug containing a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another applicant that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the condition of the new drug’s approval.
Five year and three year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full 505(b)(1) NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable PTE is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation.

In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
Further, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, reporting on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse-midwives will also be required.
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time-consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any new therapeutic product candidate. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which reimbursement for therapeutic product candidates may be sought can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
The regulations that govern coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs and therapeutic biologics vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug or therapeutic biologic before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product.

A drug company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Increasingly, third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government and private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug or therapeutic biologic will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals, may need to be conducted. Third-party payors may not consider products to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable maintenance of price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on a drug company’s investment in drug development.
Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a

condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, which has since been increased to 70%, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, was enacted by the prior presidential administration and congress, which includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case but it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. U.S. federal government agencies also currently face potentially significant spending reductions, which may further impact healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Although a number of these, and other potential, proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, the probability of success of these and any other Trump administration reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new Biden administration. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

We anticipate that these new laws will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, health reform initiatives may arise in the future, particularly as a result of the recent presidential election.
Human Capital Resources and Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 54 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 10 have an M.D., a Ph.D. or a Pharm. D. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
The pharmaceutical development business is fundamentally a people-centric, knowledge based business. Additionally, one core element of our corporate strategy is to build an industry-leading team of dermatology experts. As such, we expend considerable management time and attention, and financial resources, to attracting, retaining, and motivating exceptional individuals at our company. These efforts include not only our recruitment and compensation programs, but equally importantly, include the corporate culture that we have built at the company, and the management practices we employ in order to obtain the best possible performance from our team.
