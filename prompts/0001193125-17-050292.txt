Wireless | Wireless communications products and services include wireless voice and data services and equipment sales, which are provided to consumer, business and government customers across the United States. 
Wireline | Wirelines voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services include broadband video and data, corporate networking solutions, data center and cloud services, security and managed network services and local and long distance voice services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world.

 Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the headings Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and - Segment Results of Operations and in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report. 
 

Wireless

Background 
 Our Wireless segment, doing business as Verizon Wireless, provides wireless communications services and products across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.). Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless service provider in the United States as measured by retail connections and revenue. At December 31, 2016, Verizon Wireless had 114.2 million retail connections and 2016 revenues of approximately $89.2 billion, representing approximately 71% of Verizons aggregate revenues. 
 Cellco Partnership (Cellco), which originally held the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, began operating as Verizon Wireless in April 2000 with both Vodafone Group Plc (Vodafone) and Bell Atlantic as partners, following Vodafones contribution of its U.S. wireless assets into Cellco. On September 2, 2013, Verizon entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vodafone and Vodafone 4 Limited, pursuant to which Verizon agreed to acquire all of Vodafones indirect 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for aggregate consideration of approximately $130 billion (the Wireless Transaction). We completed the Wireless Transaction on February 21, 2014 and, as a result, we acquired 100% ownership of Verizon Wireless. The consideration paid was primarily comprised of cash and Verizon common stock. 
 We have the largest fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology and third-generation (3G) Evolution - Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks of any U.S. wireless service provider. Our 4G LTE network is available to over 98% of the U.S. population in more than 500 markets covering approximately 314 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we are working with wireless carriers in rural areas to collaboratively build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carriers network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 MHz C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. 
 We are adding capacity and density to our 4G LTE network. We are committed to developing and deploying fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology and are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development and appropriate requirements for this next generation of wireless technology. Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. We expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018.

Wireless Service and Product Offerings 
 Our wireless services are available to our customers receiving service under the Verizon Wireless brand. In addition, customers can obtain wireless products and services that operate on our network from resellers that purchase network access from us on a wholesale basis. 
Wireless Services 
 We offer our wireless services on a postpaid and prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers with Verizon Wireless that are directly served and managed by Verizon Wireless and use its branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A postpaid retail connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is billed in advance a monthly access charge in return for a monthly network service allowance, and usage beyond the allowance is billed in arrears. Approximately 95% of our total retail connections were postpaid retail connections as of December 31, 2016. Our prepaid service enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. 
 We offer various postpaid account service plans, including shared data plans, single connection plans and other plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Our shared data plans typically feature domestic unlimited voice minutes, unlimited domestic and international text, video and picture messaging, and a single data allowance that can be shared among the wireless devices on a customers account. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. On February 12, 2017, we announced an introductory plan, our new Verizon Unlimited plan, available to our consumer and small business customers, which offers among other things, unlimited domestic voice, data and texting. Both our shared data plans and the Verizon Unlimited plan include our HD (High Definition) Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot services on compatible devices. HD Voice is a suite of services enabled by Voice over LTE (VoLTE), which delivers calls over our 4G LTE network, and our Video Calling service combines an HD Voice call with real-time video. Our Mobile Hotspot service enables a customer to activate a personal Wi-Fi hotspot via their smartphone that can provide Internet access to multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices. We also offer various voice and shared data plans for small and large businesses. 
 Our simplified shared data plan, the new Verizon Plan, offers customers various sizes of data packages that can be shared among up to 10 devices on a consumer account or 25 devices on a business account. The plan features Carryover Data, which allows customers to carry over unused data to the next month, and Safety Mode, which enables customers to avoid data overage fees by allowing them to continue using data at a reduced data speed after using their data allowance. Certain plans, with higher account access amounts also include calling to and voice, text and data roaming in Mexico and Canada. Customers who wish to participate in this new plan can do so by purchasing a device from Verizon either under our device payment program or at full retail, or by using their own compatible device. 
 Customers on our fixed-term service plans have historically paid higher access fees for their wireless service in exchange for the ability to purchase their wireless devices at subsidized prices. We have largely discontinued this form of device subsidy. Under the Verizon device payment program, our eligible wireless customers purchase wireless devices under a device payment plan agreement. Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program or on a compatible device that they already own pay lower access fees (unsubsidized service pricing) as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans. Generally, customers entering into device payment plan agreements on or after June 1, 2015 are required to repay all amounts due under their device payment plan agreement before being eligible to upgrade their device. However, certain devices are subject to promotions that allow customers to upgrade to a new device after paying down a specified percentage of the balance on their device payment plan and trading in their device in good working condition. 
 We also offer prepaid single connection service plans that feature domestic unlimited voice minutes and unlimited domestic and international text. On compatible devices, certain of our prepaid plans also feature video and picture messaging, Carryover Data and Always-On Data, which allows a customer to stay online at reduced data speeds after using their data allowance. HD Voice, Video Calling and Mobile Hotspot service are available on compatible devices. Customers can manage their prepaid services on the device using their My Verizon Mobile application or logging in to the My Verizon website. 
 We offer our customers a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. We also offer service that enables our customers to access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that either have embedded 4G LTE or 3G EV-DO modules or that are used in conjunction with separate devices that enable access to this service, such as USB modems, JetpacksTM and other dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection. 
 Our customers can access multimedia offerings, provided by Verizon and by third parties, consisting of applications providing music, video, gaming, news and other content. Our business-focused offerings, which are designed to increase productivity, include solutions that enable customers to access the Internet, their corporate intranets and e-mail across our diverse portfolio of wireless devices. Our location-based services provide our customers with directions to their destination and enable our business customers to locate, monitor and communicate with their mobile field workers. Our global data services allow our customers to access data services and the Internet on all smartphones and many tablets and basic phones from hundreds of international destinations that we sell. A majority of the wireless devices used by our customers can run applications and services offered by Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) via Google Play or Apple Inc. (Apple) via iTunes. 
 Our customers can also make and receive calls on their home phone handsets using our wireless network through our Home Phone Connect service or Verizon 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice service. We also offer LTE Internet (Installed), a high-speed Internet service that provides customers with Internet connections in their homes using our 4G LTE network.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Smart Communities  Our solutions enable localities to collect data from IoT and connected machine technologies with the goal of improving public safety, managing traffic, reducing pollution, identifying revenue generation opportunities, making efficient use of limited resources and attracting businesses, residents and workers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also work with various companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end-users.
Wireless Devices 
 We offer several categories of wireless devices, including smartphones and basic phones, tablets and other Internet access devices. 
 Smartphones and Basic Phones. All of the smartphones we offer are enabled to utilize our 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO high-speed data services. These devices run on various operating platforms, primarily Apple iOS and Google Android. The basic phones we offer are 3G EV-DO-enabled and have HTML-browsing capability. 
 Tablets and Other Internet Devices. We offer tablets from multiple manufacturers, all of which can access the Internet via our 4G LTE network or a Wi-Fi connection. The tablets run primarily on the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. In addition, we offer dedicated devices, which we refer to as Jetpacks that provide a mobile Wi-Fi 4G LTE and/or 3G EV-DO connection and are capable of connecting multiple Wi-Fi enabled devices to the Internet at one time. Our customers can also access the Internet wirelessly at broadband speeds on their computers via data cards, USB modems or through the use of certain laptop computers and netbooks enabled to access our wireless network. 
 We purchase a substantial majority of our wireless devices and accessories from Apple, Samsung, Motorola Mobility, Google, LG Electronics and HTC. 
 A key component of all wireless devices is the chipset, which contains the intelligence of the device. The LTE chipsets used in our 4G LTE-enabled devices are manufactured by various companies, each using its own 4G LTE chipset technology. To support Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-1XRTT and EV-DO technologies (with and without 4G LTE), most of our wireless device suppliers currently rely on Qualcomm Incorporated for the manufacture and supply of chipsets. In addition, there are a number of other components common to wireless devices provided by various electronic component manufacturers that we do not deal with directly. 
 Network 
 We have the largest 4G LTE and 3G EV-DO networks of any service provider in the United States, with licensed and operational coverage in all of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2016, our 4G LTE network covered approximately 314 million people in the United States, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. We currently have 21 LTE in Rural America partners that provide 4G LTE coverage to an area covering approximately three million people. 
 The reliability of our wireless network is a key factor for our continued success, and we strive to provide our customers with the highest network reliability for their wireless services. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services that will fuel profitable growth. The depth and breadth of our network provides our fundamental strength and is the basis for our competitive advantage. 
 We design and deploy our network in an efficient manner that we believe maximizes the number of successful data sessions, including video, permitting the completion of large file downloads and uploads while delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and maximizes the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We plan to continue to upgrade our network, primarily to increase its capacity and density, by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antennae systems in addition to deploying existing AWS spectrum. We are also exploring strategic opportunities to increase our network capacity and efficiency through selective acquisitions of spectrum licenses. 
 Our network includes various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of our service. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macrocell in our network. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macrocells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations. 
 
5 
 
In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the United States where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside of the United States. Certain of our roaming agreements can be terminated at will by either party upon several months notice; however, we do not believe that the termination of any of these at-will agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Technology 
 Our primary network technology platforms are 4G LTE and 3G CDMA. 4G LTE provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technologies. 
 In 2014, we commercially launched our mobile VoLTE service. HD Calling, enabled by VoLTE, is now being used, in addition to CDMA technology, to provide voice calling services to our customers. 
 We are committed to developing and deploying 5G wireless technology. We are densifying our 4G LTE network to add capacity and pre-position us for 5G technology. We launched the Verizon 5G Technology Forum with key industry partners to develop 5G requirements and standards and conduct testing to accelerate the introduction of 5G technologies. We believe that 5G technology will provide higher throughput than the current 4G LTE technology, lower latency and the ability to handle more network traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. Based on the outcome of our ongoing pre-commercial trials, we intend to be the first company to deploy a 5G fixed wireless broadband network in the United States. We expect to launch a fixed commercial wireless service supported by this network in 2018. 
 Spectrum 
 The spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice and data communications services. We have licenses to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the United States. 
 In January 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction of 65 MHz of spectrum in the AWS-3 band. We participated in that auction and were the high bidder on 181 spectrum licenses, for which we paid cash of approximately $10.4 billion. The FCC granted us these spectrum licenses in April 2015. 
 We anticipate we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services, that use more bandwidth and require ever faster rates of speed. Additional spectrum may also allow us to offer new products enabled by advances in technology, including emerging 5G and IoT services. We can meet our future spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. In March 2016, the FCC commenced a voluntary incentive auction of television broadcast spectrum in the 600 MHz frequency range. The auction has finished the reverse and forward clock phases. Any results will be disclosed by the FCC after the completion of the assignment phase and after the FCC announces the close of the auction by public notice. 
 Since we and competing wireless service providers have experienced spectrum shortages in certain markets and may have spectrum surpluses in others, from time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet certain of our capacity and expansion needs in the future. In other cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps as well as any spectrum purchases are subject to obtaining governmental approvals for the transfer of spectrum licenses in each instance. 
 Additional information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report. 
 Network Equipment and Build-out
Nokia and Ericsson are currently our primary network vendors for our LTE network deployments for macro sites as well as small cells. Our primary CDMA cell site equipment infrastructure vendors are Nokia, which provides more than half of our CDMA cell site equipment, and Ericsson, which provides nearly all of our remaining cell site equipment. We also rely on Nokia and Ericsson for our switching equipment. 
 As we continue to build and upgrade our existing network, we must complete a variety of steps, including securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities for both our macro and small cells. As we densify our network, we follow a similar process for small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We utilize tower site management firms, such as Crown Castle International Corp. and American Tower Corporation (American Tower), as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing tower sites. 
 During March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American 
 
6 
 
 Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $0.1 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 Our marketing strategy is focused on offering solutions tailored to the needs of our various customer market groups; promoting our brand; leveraging our extensive distribution network; and jointly marketing our products and services to large business and government customers with Verizons Wireline business units through the Wireless Business Group, a sales and marketing organization that encompasses all of Verizon Wireless solutions for medium and large business and government customers. Our marketing plan includes a coordinated program of television, print, radio, outdoor signage, Internet and point-of-sale media promotions designed to present our corporate message consistently across all of our markets. We use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels in order to increase customer growth while reducing customer acquisition costs. 
 Company-operated stores are a core component of our distribution strategy. We have Verizon Destination Stores in various major metropolitan areas, which focus on the mobile lifestyle and highlight the many ways consumers can use wireless technology in their daily lives. These stores are part of a broader initiative that includes the redesign of our retail stores nationwide into Smart Stores, which showcase the same mobile lifestyle zones on a smaller scale. In addition, our direct channel includes our business-to-business sales operations and systems organization and is focused on supporting the wireless communications needs of consumers and local, regional and national business customers. In addition, we have a telemarketing sales force dedicated to handling incoming calls from customers, and we offer fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of wireless devices, accessories and service plans. 
 Our indirect channel includes agents that sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services at retail locations throughout the United States, as well as through the Internet. The majority of these agents sell both our postpaid and prepaid products and services, and do so under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers, such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target, to sell our postpaid and prepaid wireless products and services. Stores such as Dollar General and various drugstore chains sell our prepaid products and services. 
Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from facilities-based wireless service providers for resale, including resellers that buy from us. Competition is intense as a result of continuing increases in wireless market penetration levels, network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, the introduction of new products and services, new market entrants, the availability of additional spectrum, both licensed and unlicensed, and regulatory changes. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers. 
 The wireless industry also faces competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft, Google, Apple and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. 
 We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors in our industry: 
 

 | Network reliability, capacity and coverage. We believe that a wireless network that consistently provides high-quality and reliable service is a key differentiator in the U.S. market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new wireless service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of wireless services, which, in turn, puts pressure on network capacity. In order to compete effectively, wireless service providers must keep pace with network capacity needs and offer highly reliable national coverage through their networks. We believe that our investments in our 4G LTE network to increase network capacity will enable us to meet consumer demand.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pricing. Service and equipment pricing play an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, we and other wireless service providers are offering service plans at competitive prices that include unlimited voice minutes and text messages and a specific amount of data access in varying megabyte or gigabyte sizes or, in some cases, on an unlimited basis subject to certain restrictions. These allowances will vary from time to time as part of promotional offers or in response to market circumstances. We and many other wireless service providers also allow customers on certain plans to carry over unused data allowances to the next billing period, or to stay online at a reduced data speed after using all of a data allowance for a billing period. In addition, some wireless service providers have bundled wireless service offerings with other products while others offer promotional pricing and incentives targeted specifically to customers of Verizon Wireless.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options that distinguish service pricing from equipment pricing and blur the traditional boundary between prepaid and postpaid plans. These payment options include device payment plans, 
 
7 
 
 which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and device leasing arrangements. Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service provider significantly, and in some cases fully, subsidized the customers device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device payment plans. We and many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy. 
 

 | Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other wireless providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. Our competitors also recognize the importance of customer service and are also focused on improving in this area. As part of our efforts to transform and simplify the customer experience, we launched a new My Verizon app, which allows customers to manage their price plan, data usage, account and billing from their device. As part of our efforts to promote long-term relationships with our customers, we offer Verizon Smart Rewards, which is a program that offers a wide variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points they earn in connection with their account-related interactions with Verizon Wireless. The program offers customers discounts and savings on merchandise from well-known brands, as well as discounts and other offers at local shopping and dining venues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product and service development. As wireless technologies develop and wireless broadband networks proliferate, continued customer and revenue growth will be increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced data products and services. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative wireless products and services both independently and in collaboration with application and content providers. We also collaborate with various device manufacturers in the development of distinctive smartphones and other wireless devices that can access the growing array of data applications and content available over the Internet. We continue to focus on increasing the penetration of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices throughout our customer base.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sales and distribution. The key to achieving sales success in the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We believe that attaining the optimal combination of varying distribution channels is important to achieving industry-leading profitability, as measured by operating income. We endeavor to increase sales through our company-operated stores, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and prepaid replenishment locations, and through manufacturers of laptops and netbooks with embedded 4G LTE and 3G modules that can access the Internet on our network at broadband speeds. In addition, we sell network access to both traditional resellers, which resell network services to their end-users, and to various companies to enable wireless communications for their IoT devices or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Capital resources. In order to expand the capacity and coverage of their networks and introduce new products and services, wireless service providers require significant capital resources. We generate significant cash flow from operations, as do some of our competitors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various factors affecting the wireless industry, including the factors described above, as well as new technologies, new business models, changes in customer preferences, regulatory changes, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies of competitors. 
 

Wireline

Background 
 Our Wireline segment provides voice, data and video communications products and enhanced services. We provide these products and services to consumers in the United States, as well as to carriers, businesses and government customers both in the United States and around the world. In 2016, Wireline revenues were $31.3 billion, representing approximately 25% of Verizons aggregate revenues. 
Strategic Transactions 
 On February 5, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) pursuant to which Verizon sold its local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states, for approximately $10.5 billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $0.6 billion of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction, which included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizons incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas, did not involve any assets or liabilities of Verizon Wireless. The transaction closed on April 1, 2016. 
 The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2 million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier. The operating results of these businesses are excluded from our Wireline segment for all periods presented to reflect comparable segment operating results consistent with the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.

On February 20, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings wireline business, which owns and operates one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks, for approximately $1.8 billion, subject to adjustment. We completed the acquisition on February 1, 2017. Separately, we entered into an agreement to lease certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings that holds its wireless spectrum. Verizon has an option, exercisable under certain circumstances, to buy that subsidiary. 
 We are reinventing our network architecture around a common fiber platform that will support both our wireless and wireline technologies. We expect that this new One Fiber architecture will improve our 4G LTE coverage, speed the deployment of 5G, deliver high-speed Fios broadband to homes and businesses and create new opportunities in the small and medium business market. In April 2016, we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We launched One Fiber for consumer and business services to customers in Boston late in 2016. 
 On December 6, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with Equinix, Inc. pursuant to which Verizon will sell 24 customer-facing data center sites in the United States and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments. The sale does not affect Verizons data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada, or its managed hosting and cloud offerings. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, and is expected to close during the first half of 2017. 
 Wireline Service and Product Offerings 
 We organize our service and product offerings by the primary customers targeted by these offerings  mass markets, global enterprise and global wholesale. 
 Mass Markets 
 Mass Markets operations provide broadband Internet and video services (including high-speed Internet, Fios Internet and Fios video services), and local exchange (basic service and end-user access) and long distance (including regional toll) voice services to residential and small business subscribers. In 2016, Mass Markets revenues were $14.4 billion, representing approximately 46% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. 
 Internet services. We offer Fios Internet and high-speed Internet services with varying throughput speeds. We believe that as consumers connect more devices and stream more video, they will require increased broadband speeds. With our Fios Quantum broadband service and certain other data services, our customers can achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 500 Mbps, and we recently launched our Instant Internet service, which allows customers in certain markets to achieve symmetrical upload and download speeds of 750 Mbps and higher. As more data storage and, in some cases, processing is moved to the cloud, we believe that customers will place an increasing value on upstream performance that matches what they already receive for downloads. 
 Video services. We offer video service over our fiber-optic network. As of December 31, 2016, Fios video services were available to approximately 14 million homes across 9 states, as well as the District of Columbia. We have several offerings available to our Fios TV customers, including: 

 | Fios Quantum TV, which provides customers the ability to record up to 12 shows at once and control live TV from any room in their home;

Global Wholesale 
 Global Wholesale provides communications services, including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services, primarily to local, long distance, wireless and other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2016, Global Wholesale revenues were $5.0 billion, representing approximately 16% of Wirelines aggregate revenues. A portion of Global Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. 
 Global Wholesale provides the following services, which it jointly markets with Verizons other business units through Verizon Enterprise Solutions: 
 

 | Data services. We offer a robust portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our wholesale customers networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers. Our data services include high-speed digital data offerings, such as Ethernet and Wavelength services, as well as core data circuits, such as DS1s and DS3s. In addition, we receive revenue from data services that is generated from carriers that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Data services also include certain value-added business services, which leverage many of the same offerings available in the Global Enterprise portfolio, including:

Network 
 Verizon operates a large and advanced telecommunications network in the United States and around the world to provide services and solutions to its customers. 
 

 | Fios. Our fiber-to-the-home network through which we provide our Fios residential broadband service has passed over 16.9 million premises in the United States as of December 31, 2016. Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. The continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios makes us well positioned to meet these demands in a cost effective and efficient manner. Our PON technology provides the flexibility to adapt our network to deliver increased data speeds and new services without major overhauls or replacements to the fiber-optic infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 
 
While deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, the PON infrastructure is also finding more widespread application in the enterprise sector, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services. 
 

 | Global IP. Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber networks in the world, providing connectivity to business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP network includes long haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 800,000 route miles and enable and support far reaching international operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Global business is rapidly evolving to an everything-as-a-service model in which business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. With the continued deployment of packet optical transport strategy, Verizon is creating a single, high-capacity global network platform that combines optical transport with advanced packet switching technology. The result is a global IP network that can offer powerful solutions to these service demands. 
 We believe that our continued focus on enhancing our domestic and global fiber-based networks, and achieving cost efficient solutions through new technology deployments, will help Verizon advance its position as a provider of choice to residential and enterprise customers. 
 Competition 
 The wireline telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to intensify further with traditional, non-traditional and emerging players seeking increased market share. Current and potential competitors include cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. 
 In addition, companies with a global presence increasingly compete with our wireline businesses. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale markets. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated services to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. 
 We believe the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the wireline industry: 
 

 | Bandwidth (speed) and network reliability: Consumers and small business customers are seeking to leverage high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity. As online and online-enabled activities increase, so will bandwidth requirements, both downstream and upstream. To succeed, we and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing bandwidth requirements. In addition, network reliability and security are increasingly important competitive factors in the global enterprise market. We continue to invest in our network to be able to meet growing bandwidth demand and provide the most reliable and secure network.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pricing: Cable operators, telecommunications companies and integrated service providers use pricing to capture market share from incumbents. Pricing is also a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based calling is free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customer service: Customers expect industry-leading service from their service providers. As technologies and services evolve, the ability to excel in this area is important for customer acquisition and retention. In Mass Markets, we compete in this area through our service representatives and online support. In Global Enterprise, we provide our customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our network to identify issues before they affect customers. In the Global Wholesale business, we believe service improvement can be achieved through continued system automation initiatives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Product differentiation: As a result of pricing pressures, providers need to differentiate their products and services. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband and video connections. Converged features, such as integrated wireless and wireline functionality, are becoming similarly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Innovation: The delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of the customer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 
In the Mass Markets business, cable operators are significant competitors. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to offer digital products and services. We continue to market competitive bundled offerings that include high-speed Internet access, digital television and voice services. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. 
 We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their service as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable companies and other providers of VoIP services as well as Internet portal providers. In addition, customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services and that content can be accessed on a TV, computer, tablet or mobile phone. 
 In the global enterprise market, the customers need to reduce technical complexity coupled with the growth opportunity created by technology convergence is driving the expansion of the competitive landscape. Major competitors include system integrators, carriers and hardware and software providers. Some of the biggest companies in IT services are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets or forging new alliances to be better positioned for a rebound in technology spending. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields such as cloud computing, software delivery, communication applications and other computing tasks via the network, rather than on in-house machines. Carriers have also utilized acquisitions to make significant inroads into enterprise outsourcing markets that have long been dominated by the major IT outsourcers. 
 Global Wholesale competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this new revenue opportunity. 
 We also compete with competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs). Our telephone operations generally have been required to sell their services to CLECs at significant discounts from the prices our telephone operations charge their retail customers. 
 

New Product Development and Strategic Initiatives

 Technology developments, interconnected markets, shifting consumer needs and converging industry ecosystems are creating innovative opportunities for Verizon. We are transforming around the capabilities of our high-performing networks, with a goal of future growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the new digital world. Our three tier strategy is to lead at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, develop new business models through global platforms in digital media and IoT and deliver solutions to key industry segments for incremental monetization. To execute this strategy, we have created an organization devoted to the development of new products and the cultivation of new businesses. This organization is focused on leveraging all of our assets to create innovative products and services that can provide our customers with integrated solutions that address their needs. Several strategic initiatives have been undertaken by this organization in the areas of digital media, interactive entertainment and IoT and telematics products and services. 
 As a market leader in offering differentiated solutions to our connected customers across their devices at home, at work and on the go, Verizon will continue to focus on strategic partnerships as an important pillar of our future strategy. Strategic partnerships are aimed at complementing and augmenting our strengths, expanding our addressable market, accelerating our pace of innovation, enabling faster delivery of solutions such as media and IoT to the marketplace and, where possible, lowering our market and execution risk. Strong partnerships are expected to further our efforts to offer comprehensive solutions for our customers. We look to formulate strategic partnerships and alliances with a global orientation, which we believe will benefit us in terms of technology sourcing, content acquisition, consumer insights and application ecosystems. 
 We believe these investments will assist us in bringing innovative next generation products and services to market and uncovering new sources of revenue, increasing revenue from existing projects and leveraging our strengths across the company. 
 Digital Media and Interactive Entertainment 
 Verizon has been investing in emerging technology that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. We have been investing in video assets and capabilities with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer. We believe the growth in video consumption using mobile devices provides us with an opportunity for revenue growth. Through various acquisitions and investments and the launch of video streaming products and services, we are expanding the ways in which we can deliver content to our customers, including the following: 

 | In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. AOLs business model aligns with our approach, and we believe that its combination of owned and operated content properties plus a digital advertising platform enhances our ability to further develop future revenue streams. During 2015, we also acquired Millennial Media, an advertising technology business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In July 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoos operating business, for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Transaction). On February 20, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Transaction purchase price will be reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The Transaction is expected to provide us with a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications, including market leading content in sports, finance, news and email services, which have attracted over one billion monthly active consumer views. The Transaction is expected to also expand our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhance our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers. Additional discussion of the Transaction is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.

 | In 2015, we launched go90, a mobile-first social entertainment platform that provides the opportunity for ad-supported mobile video streaming as well as subscription-based services. Digital content available on the go90 platform includes live events, popular web and television content and original content. In 2016, we introduced StreamPass, which offers streaming of live sports through go90 free of data charges to Verizon Wireless customers on certain data plans. We also introduced FreeBee Data, a sponsored data service that enables content providers to provide our customers with access to some or all of the providers mobile content or to sponsor specific consumer actions on a per-click basis, free of data charges to the customer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have made investments in converging technologies and services involving content delivery networks (CDNs), video streaming and related consumer hardware to leverage new content models. Our wireless network enables us to move towards a unified video strategy that positions us to take advantage of this growth opportunity. We began using Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service technology to develop our LTE Multicast service, which we use to deliver live events in go90. This service has the potential to enhance our network efficiency and provide our customers with access to live streaming video content with virtually no buffering, regardless of the number of devices using the service. We also believe it is important to have rights to deliver content over a wireless network that do not require an authentication back to a subscription agreement. For example, our NFL agreement allows our customers to access certain games live on our 4G LTE network without authenticating back to any subscription.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We continue to invest in Verizon Digital Media Services, which offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites, to our customers on their devices at any time. As the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for a stable, high-quality video delivery platform. We are focused on providing a simple end-to-end global platform for the delivery of media to customers, which we believe will be superior to that offered by the existing and highly fragmented media delivery ecosystem. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses focused on delivering their digital products and services through the Internet. We also expect, through this platform, to further integrate our Fios and wireless offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | During 2016, we established Verizon Hearst Media Partners, LLC, a content joint venture with Hearst Entertainment & Syndication (Hearst), to build new multiplatform digital video channels targeted to the mobile millennial audience. In partnership with Hearst, we have also invested in two media companies, AwesomenessTV Holdings, LLC and Complex Media, Inc. & CM Partners, LLC, which are leaders in producing content targeted at key demographics, in order to further diversify our content and distribution businesses within our digital media portfolio.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Internet of Things and Telematics 
 The adoption of IoT technology continues to grow as companies across a wide range of industries are leveraging IoT technologies to increase efficiency, gain better customer insights, facilitate compliance with regulations and build new business models. Although IoT growth is expanding broadly, adoption is particularly strong in the telematics and transportation industries, as well as the fields of smart communities, healthcare, utilities and energy management. We are building our growth capabilities in the IoT market by developing business models that monetize usage on our network at the connectivity, platform and solution layers. For example, we have developed IoT solutions that address key market needs for electric and other utilities, farms and other purveyors of food and agriculture, drug companies and others with complex supply chains. In addition, our IoT customers can turn the data that our solutions provide into actionable opportunities to develop new services and create revenue growth. 
 Our strategy to simplify IoT technology and accelerate its adoption also includes ThingSpace, an IoT platform. ThingSpace is designed to help developers create, test, manage and market IoT-based solutions aimed at major vertical markets, such as energy, health care and connected cities. ThingSpace comes with a portal that includes immediate access to dedicated application programming interfaces and partner development kits. In October 2016, we acquired Sensity Systems, Inc., a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart communities, in order to add a leading comprehensive suite of smart city solutions. 
 Through Verizon Telematics, we provide connectivity and telematics services and applications to manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz and help businesses manage large vehicle fleets more efficiently. Our suite of real-time vehicle communications services and applications connects automobiles with content services and call centers. Our platform enables factory and aftermarket-installed automotive safety and security features as well as location-based services and vehicle diagnostics. We provide usage-based data services to new vehicles in the United States, China and Europe. Our Verizon Telematics solution provides commercial fleet managers throughout North America with real-time access to data that yields operational efficiencies, increased vehicle reliability and improved driver safety. We also provide this service to over 23,000 vehicles operated by Verizon. 
 In 2015, we introduced hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service. This subscription-based service provides consumers with diagnostic technology in their vehicles, access to live assistance and roadside assistance with GPS accuracy when needed. Our hum service also offers the ability to connect with a certified mechanic to diagnose potential problems and offer solutions. 
 In 2016, we acquired Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, and Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management software company. We expect these acquisitions to advance our fleet telematics solutions, expand our distribution relationships and position our telematics business as a leading provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions globally.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

 We own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizons research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration being paid to us, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations. 
 We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services. 
 

Acquisitions and Divestitures

 Information about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2016 Verizon Annual Report to Shareowners under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures, which is incorporated by reference into this report. 
 

Regulatory and Competitive Trends

Regulatory and Competitive Landscape 
 Verizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers, and other non-traditional companies. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation. 
Federal Regulation 
 Wireless Services 
 The FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions. 
 Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizons wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called open access FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. 
Broadband 
 Verizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized that broadband Internet access services as information services subject to a light touch regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC reversed course and declared that broadband Internet access services are telecommunications services subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. This decision created uncertainty concerning the level of regulation that will apply to broadband services. It created a risk that such regulation would limit the ways that broadband Internet access service providers structure their business arrangements and manage their networks and could spur additional restrictions, including rate regulation, that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. The FCCs decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, but may be subject to further challenge in the courts. In addition, Congress and the FCC are likely to continue to debate the proper scope of such regulations. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment. 
 
14 
 
Wireline Voice 
 Verizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be common carrier services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. 
Video 
 Verizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has typically been required to obtain a franchise from local authorities. 
Privacy and Data Security 
 We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including voice, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the IoT space. At the federal level, much of our business is subject to the FCCs privacy and data security requirements. In November 2016, the FCC released new privacy and data security rules that will apply to all telecommunications services, including our fixed and mobile voice and broadband services. Other parts of our business are subject to the privacy and data security oversight of other federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level. In addition, a new data protection regulation will go into effect in Europe in May 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance.
Public Safety and Cybersecurity 
 The FCC has played a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to recent cyber attacks, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. 
Intercarrier Compensation and Network Access 
 The FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline business data services and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. 
State Regulation and Local Regulation 
 Wireless Services 
 The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other terms and conditions of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process. 
Wireline Services 
 State public utility commissions regulate Verizons telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an incumbent local exchange carrier in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated. In addition, as a video services operator in many states, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations, as a result.

Environmental Matters

 Reserves have been established to cover environmental matters relating to discontinued businesses and past telecommunications activities. These reserves include funds to address contamination at the site of a former Sylvania facility in Hicksville, NY, which had processed nuclear fuel rods in the 1950s and 1960s. In September 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) accepted the site into its Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. As a result, the ACE has taken primary responsibility for addressing the contamination at the site. An adjustment to the reserves may be made after a cost allocation is conducted with respect to the past and future expenses of all of the parties. Adjustments to the environmental reserve may also be made based upon the actual conditions found at other sites requiring remediation.
