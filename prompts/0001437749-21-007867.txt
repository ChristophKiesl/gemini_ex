ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
The following discussion of our business contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties (see the section entitled “Forward Looking Statements” herein). Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 
Overview
 
We develop, manufacture, and market bioproduction tools and services to the cell and gene therapy (“CGT”) industry, which are designed to improve quality and de-risk biologic manufacturing and delivery. We also provide biological and pharmaceutical storage services to the CGT industry. Our products are used in basic and applied research, and commercial manufacturing of biologic-based therapies. Customers use our products to maintain the health and function of biologic material during sourcing, manufacturing, storage, and distribution of cells and tissues.
 
We currently operate as one bioproduction tools and services business with product lines that support several steps in the biologic material manufacturing and delivery process. We have a diversified portfolio of tools and services that focus on biopreservation, frozen storage, and thawing of biologic materials. We have in-house expertise in cryobiology and continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform for our extensive customer base through both organic growth innovations and acquisitions.
 
COVID-19 Considerations
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. During 2020, we believe our quarterly revenues were affected by COVID-19. During the first quarter, our biopreservation media product lines benefited due to what we believe was safety stock purchasing by our customers due to COVID-19. In the second and third quarters, we believe that revenues were negatively impacted by a reduction in clinical trial progression and temporary halts. We then noticed an increase of purchasing in biopreservation media in the fourth quarter as clinical trials and research lab activity resumed with reduced restrictions. Our biological and pharmaceutical services business that we acquired in the fourth quarter was in-line with expectations and we expect increased demand for biological material storage with the reduction of COVID-19 restrictions. Our 2020 revenue was negatively affected for our automated thawing devices, cloud connected “smart” shipping containers, and freezer and storage technology lines of business by the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on in-person selling, customer budget cuts for capital equipment and lack of personnel at our customer sites to receive capital equipment. We have tried and, to date, have been successful in mitigating any supply chain problems. However, we cannot provide any assurance that a continued or prolonged global pandemic will not have a negative impact on our manufacturing and shipping processes or our product costs. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our future financial results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the recurrence, severity and/or duration of the ongoing pandemic, and current or future domestic and international actions to contain and treat COVID-19.
 
We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the promotion of social distancing and work-from-home arrangements. We are taking a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include increasing our raw materials, manufacturing safety stock inventory for our biopreservation media and expanding availability of our biological and pharmaceutical storage, requiring remote working arrangements for employees who are not integral to physically making and shipping our products or who do not need specialized equipment to perform their work, restricting on-site visits by non-employees and implementing social distancing protocols, and investing in personal protective equipment. Beginning April 2, 2020 face masks were required to be worn by all employees and contractors at all sites. Effective May 11, 2020, temperature screening was required upon entering our facilities where mandated by state law. Starting on May 11, 2020, our employees were required to complete daily COVID-19 exposure and symptom questionnaires where mandated, with the requirement rolling out companywide on October 13, 2020 for all locations.
 
For further discussion of the risks relating to COVID-19, see “Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, below.

Biopreservation Media
 
Our proprietary biopreservation media products, HypoThermosol® FRS and CryoStor®, are formulated to mitigate preservation-induced, delayed-onset cell damage and death, which result when cells and tissues are subjected to reduced temperatures. Our technology can provide our CGT customers with significant shelf life extension of biologic source material and final cell products, and can also greatly improve post-preservation cell and tissue viability and function. Our biopreservation media is serum-free, protein-free, fully defined, and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). We strive to source wherever possible, the highest available grade, multi-compendium raw materials. We estimate our media products have been incorporated in over 450 customer clinical applications, including numerous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell and other cell types. 
 
Stability (i.e. shelf-life) and functional recovery are crucial aspects of academic research and clinical practice in the biopreservation of biologic-based source material, intermediate derivatives, and isolated/derived/expanded cellular products and therapies. Limited stability is especially critical in the CGT field, where harvested cells and tissues will lose viability over time, if not maintained appropriately at normothermic body temperature (37ºC) or stored in a hypothermic state in an effective preservation medium. Chilling (hypothermia) is used to reduce metabolism and delay degradation of harvested cells and tissues. However, subjecting biologic material to hypothermic environments induces damaging molecular stress and structural changes. Although cooling successfully reduces metabolism (i.e., lowers demand for energy), various levels of cellular damage and death occur when using suboptimal methods. Traditional biopreservation media range from simple “balanced salt” (electrolyte) formulations to complex mixtures of electrolytes, energy substrates such as sugars, osmotic buffering agents and antibiotics. The limited stability, which results from the use of these traditional biopreservation media formulations, is a significant shortcoming that our optimized proprietary products address with great success.
 
Our scientific research activities over the last 20+ years enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the hypothermic and cryogenic (low-temperature induced) damage/destruction of cells through apoptosis and necrosis. This research led directly to the development of our HypoThermosol® FRS and CryoStor® technologies. Our proprietary biopreservation media products are specifically formulated to:
 

● | Minimize cell and tissue swelling
--+----------------------------------


● | Reduce free radical levels upon formation
--+------------------------------------------


● | Maintain appropriate low temperature ionic balances
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Provide regenerative, high energy substrates to stimulate recovery upon warming
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Avoid the creation of an acidic state (acidosis)
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Inhibit the onset of apoptosis and necrosis
--+--------------------------------------------

 
A key feature of our biopreservation media products is their “fully-defined” profile. All of our cGMP products are serum-free, protein-free and are formulated and filled using aseptic processing. We strive to use USP/Multicompendial grade or the highest quality available synthetic components. All of these features benefit prospective customers by facilitating the qualification process required to incorporate our products into their regulatory filings.
 
The results of independent testing demonstrate that our biopreservation media products significantly extend shelf-life and improve cell and tissue post-thaw viability and function. Our products have demonstrated improved biopreservation outcomes, including greatly extended shelf-life and post-thaw viability, across a broad array of cell and tissue types.
 
Competing biopreservation media products are often formulated with simple isotonic media cocktails, animal serum, potentially a single sugar or human protein. A key differentiator of our proprietary HypoThermosol FRS formulation is the engineered optimization of the key ionic component concentrations for low temperature environments, as opposed to normothermic body temperature around 37°C, as found in culture media or saline-based isotonic formulas. Competing cryopreservation freeze media is often comprised of a single permeating cryoprotectant such as dimethyl sulfoxide (“DMSO”). Our CryoStor formulations incorporate multiple permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectant agents which allow for multiple mechanisms of protection and reduces the dependence on a single cryoprotectant. We believe that our products offer significant advantages over in-house formulations, or commercial “generic” preservation media, including, time saving, improved quality of components, more rigorous quality control release testing, more cost effective and improved preservation efficacy.
 
We estimate that annual revenue from each customer commercial application in which our products are used could range from $500,000 to $2.0 million, if such application is approved and our customer commences large scale commercial manufacturing of the biologic based therapy.

Automated, Water-Free Thawing Products
 
In April 2019, we acquired Astero Bio Corporation (“Astero”), to expand our bioprocessing tools portfolio and diversify our revenue streams. The Astero ThawSTAR® line includes automated vial and cryobag thawing products that control the heat and timing of the thawing process of biologic material. Our customizable, automated, water-free thawing products uses algorithmic programmed, heating plates to consistently bring biologic material from a frozen state to a liquid state in a controlled and consistent manner. This helps reduce damage during the temperature transition. The ThawSTAR products can reduce risks of contamination versus using a traditional water bath.
evo® Cloud Connected Shipping Containers
 
In August 2019, we acquired the remaining shares of SAVSU Technologies, Inc. (“SAVSU”) we did not previously own. SAVSU is a leading developer and supplier of next generation cold chain management tools for cell and gene therapies. The evo.is cloud app allows biologic products to be traced and tracked in real time. Our evo platform consists of rentable cloud-connected shippers and include technologies that enable tracking software provides real-time information on geolocation, payload temperature, ambient temperature, tilt of shipper, humidity, altitude, and real-time alerts when a shipper has been opened. Our internally developed evo.is software allows customers to customize alert notifications both in data measurements and user requirements. The evo Dry Vapor Shipper (“DVS”) is specifically marketed to cell and gene therapies. The evo DVS has improved form factor and ergonomics over the traditional dewar, including extended thermal performance, reduced liquid nitrogen recharge time, improved payload extractors and ability to maintain temperature for longer periods on its side.
 
We utilize couriers who already have established logistic channels and distribution centers. Our strategy greatly reduces the cash need to build out specialized facilities around the world. Our partnerships with several white glove couriers allow us to scale our sales and marketing effort by utilizing their salesforce. Our courier partnerships market our evo platform to their existing cell and gene therapy customers as a cost effective and innovative solution. We also market directly to our existing and prospective customers who can utilize the evo platform through our courier partnerships. 
 
Liquid Nitrogen Freezer and Storage Devices
 
In November 2019, we acquired Custom Biogenic Systems, Inc. (“CBS”) a global leader in the design and manufacture of state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen laboratory freezers, cryogenic equipment and accessories. The addition of CBS allows for product line growth, diversification of revenue and the potential for reduction of supply chain costs for our evo dry vapor shippers.
 
Included in CBS’s product line of liquid nitrogen freezers are the Isothermal LN2 freezers, constructed with a patented system which stores liquid nitrogen in a jacketed space in the walls of the freezer. This dry storage method eliminates liquid nitrogen contact with stored specimens, reduces the risk of cross-contamination and provides increased user safety in a laboratory setting. To accommodate customer requirements, we offer customizable features including wide bodied and extended height.
 
To accompany the offerings of cryogenic freezer equipment, we supply equipment for storing critically important biological materials. This storage equipment includes upright freezer racks, chest freezer racks, liquid nitrogen freezer racks, canisters/cassettes and frames as well as laboratory boxes and dividers. Due to our onsite design and manufacturing capability, racks and canisters can be customized to address customers’ varying requirements.
 
In order to provide customers with a proactive approach to safety and monitoring of equipment containing liquefied gas, CBS offers Versalert, a patented wireless remote asset monitoring system that can monitor and record temperatures. Versalert has an intelligent mesh network system that enables customers to view current equipment conditions and receive alarm notification on smartphones, tablets or personal computers and maintain permanent electronic records for regulatory compliance and legal verification.
 
Biological and Pharmaceutical Storage
 
In October 2020, we acquired SciSafe Holdings, Inc. (“SciSafe”), a premier provider of biological and pharmaceutical storage. In addition to providing storage services, SciSafe provides cold chain logistics that ensures materials are kept at target temperatures from the moment that the materials leave the customer’s premises to their ultimate return. State-of-the-art monitoring systems employed by SciSafe allow for customers to monitor the storage temperatures of their materials throughout the entire logistics chain.
 
We operate four storage facilities in the USA.

Our Market Opportunity
 
The CGT market has been rapidly expanding, treating diseases once thought incurable. According to the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (“ARM”) there were over 1,100 ongoing clinical trials utilizing regenerative medicine at the end of 2020. ARM also states there were over $19.9 billion in total global financings in the regenerative market in 2020. The FDA predicts ten to twenty cell and gene therapies per year will be approved by 2025.
 
These technologies change the way physicians treat patients. The manufacturing, distribution and the delivery process is significantly different from many other types of medicines and therapies. We believe we are well positioned to address many of the manufacturing difficulties in the process of producing cell and gene therapies.
 
The Bioproduction Process
 
Our products currently fulfill several steps in the bioproduction process for cell and gene therapies. See the diagram below from an illustration of this process and our product roles. We now offer products that integrate into the critical steps of preservation, thawing, fixed storage, and transportable storage under controlled conditions.

Manufacturing
 
Biopreservation Media - We maintain and operate two independent cGMP clean room production suites for manufacturing sterile biopreservation media products in Bothell, Washington. Our quality management system (“QMS”) is certified to the ISO 13485:2016 standard. Our QMS is aligned with applicable sections of 21 CFR Part 820 - Quality System Regulation for Good Manufacturing Practice of medical devices, 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 - cGMP for Finished Pharmaceuticals, FDA Guidance - Sterile Drug Products, Volume 4, EU Guidelines Annex 1 - Manufacture of Sterile Medicinal Products, ISO 13408 - Aseptic Processing of Healthcare Products, and ISO 14644 - Clean Rooms and Associated Controlled Environments. We seek to manage single-source supplier risk by regularly assessing the quality and capacity of our suppliers, implementing supply and quality agreements where appropriate and actively managing lead times and inventory levels of sourced components. Pursuant to our supply agreements, we are required to notify customers of any changes to our raw materials. For certain components in which we do not have a secondary supplier, we estimate that it would take up to six months to find and qualify a second source. Order quantities and lead times for externally sourced components are based on our forecasts, which are derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the materials and parts. Due to COVID-19, we have seen increased lead times for certain raw materials, particularly personal protective equipment used in our clean rooms and certain form factors of bottles and vials used in our finished products. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our biopreservation media products.
Automated Thawing – Our ThawSTAR automated, water-free thawing products are produced by a contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) based in the United States. We believe this CMO has the skills, experience and capacity needed to meet our quality standards and demand expectations for the product line. Due to COVID-19, we have seen increased lead times from our CMO due to increased lead times from our CMO’s suppliers. We estimate that it would take up to six months to find and qualify an alternative CMO. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining our automated thaw products from our CMO.
evo Cold Chain Products – Production of our evo cold chain management hardware products is performed by external CMOs and by personnel in our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility. Our QMS is certified to the ISO 9001:2015 standard. Due to COVID-19, we have seen increased lead times for certain raw materials and components from our suppliers. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our evo cold chain products.

Biological and Pharmaceutical Storage – SciSafe operates three cGMP compliant storage facilities and two other state-of-the-art facilities in the United States. Two facilities are certified to the ISO 20387:2018 standard. We rely on outside suppliers for the build out of our cold-storage chambers and stand-alone freezers. Due to COVID-19, we have experienced increased lead times in acquiring stand-alone freezers, which we use to store customer’s biologic materials.
Product Regulatory Status
 
Our media, thawing, freezer, and evo products are not subject to any specific United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other international marketing regulations for drugs, devices, or biologics. We are not required to sponsor formal prospective, controlled clinical trials in order to establish safety and efficacy. However, to support our current and prospective clinical customers, we manufacture and release our products in compliance with cGMP and other relevant quality standards.
 
To assist customers with their regulatory applications, we maintain Type II Master Files at the FDA for CryoStor, HypoThermosol FRS, BloodStor 27, and our Cell Thawing Media products, which provide the FDA with information regarding our manufacturing facility and process, our quality system, stability and safety, and any additional testing that has been performed. Customers engaged in clinical and commercial applications may notify the FDA of their intention to use our products in their product development and manufacturing process by requesting a cross-reference to our master files.
 
One freezer in our Customer Biogenic Systems product line is currently regulated as a Class 2 medical device in the EU.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The following table lists our granted and pending patents. We have also obtained certain trademarks and tradenames for our products to distinguish our genuine products from our competitors’ products and we maintain certain details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets. While we believe that the protection of patents and trademarks is important to our business, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, scientific expertise and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain aspects of our products and/or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for additional details). The laws of some foreign countries in which we may sell our products do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.

Competition
 
Our bioproduction products and services compete on the basis of value proposition, performance, quality, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products have greater financial and human resources, R&D, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to or compete with our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete.
