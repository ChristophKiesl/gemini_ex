Overview
 
Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. (“Sino” or the “Company”), a Virginia corporation, was founded in the United States (the “U.S.”) in 2001. Sino is a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistics integrated solution provider. Sino provides tailored solutions and value-added services to its customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. Our current service offerings consist of inland transportation management services, freight logistics services, and container trucking services. We suspended our shipping agency and ship management services from the beginning of the fiscal year 2016, primarily due to changes in market condition. We also suspended our shipping and chartering services primarily as a result of the termination of vessel acquisition in December 2015.
 
The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. (New York and Los Angeles), the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”), including Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. Currently, a significant portion of our business is generated from the clients located in the PRC. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company established ACH Trucking Center Corp. in New York as a joint venture with Jetta Global Logistics Inc. The Company owns 51% of ACH Trucking Center Corp.
 
Company Structure and Function
 
The Company conducts its business primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. (New York and Los Angeles), China (including Hong Kong), Australia, and Canada.
 



The Company’s subsidiary in China, Trans Pacific Shipping Limited (“Trans Pacific Beijing”), a wholly owned foreign enterprise, invested in one 90%-owned subsidiary, Trans Pacific Logistics Shanghai Limited (“Trans Pacific Shanghai”. Trans Pacific Beijing and Trans Pacific Shanghai are referred to collectively as “Trans Pacific”). As PRC laws and regulations restrict foreign ownership of local shipping agency service businesses, the Company provided its shipping agency services in the PRC through Sino-Global Shipping Agency Ltd. (“Sino-China” or “VIE”), a Chinese legal entity, which holds the licenses and permits necessary to operate local shipping agency services in the PRC. Trans Pacific Beijing and Sino-China do not have a parent-subsidiary relationship. Trans Pacific Beijing has contractual arrangements with Sino-China and its shareholders that enable the Company to substantially control Sino-China. Through Sino-China, the Company was able to provide local shipping agency services in all commercial ports in the PRC. In light of the Company’s decision not to pursue the local shipping agency business, the Company has suspended its shipping agency services through its VIE and has not undertaken any business through or with Sino-China since June 2014. Nevertheless, the Company continues to maintain its contractual relationship with the VIE because Sino-China is one of the committee members of China Association of Shipping Agencies & Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (“CASA”). CASA was approved to form by China Ministry of Communications. Sino-China is also our only entity that is qualified to do shipping agency business in China. We keep the VIE to prepare ourselves for the market to turn around. 
 
Currently, the Company’s inland transportation management services are operated by its subsidiaries in the PRC (including Hong Kong) and the U.S. Our freight logistic services are operated by the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC, New York and Los Angeles. Our container trucking services are mainly operated by our subsidiaries and joint venture company in the PRC, New York and Los Angeles.

Corporate History and Our Business
 
Since inception in 2001 and through our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, our sole business was providing shipping agency services. In general, we provided two types of shipping agency services: loading/discharging services and protective agency services, in which we acted as a general agent to provide value added solutions to our customers. For loading/discharging agency services, we received the total payment from our customers in U.S. dollars and paid the port charges on behalf of our customers in RMB. For protective agency services, we charged a fixed amount as agent fee while customers are responsible for the payment of port costs and expenses. Under these circumstances, we generally required a portion of a customer’s payment in advance and billed the remaining balance within 30 days after the transaction were completed. We believe the most significant factors that directly or indirectly affected our shipping agency service revenues were:

● | the number of ship-times to which we provide port loading/discharging services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the size and types of ships we serve; 
● | the type of services we provide; 
● | the rate of service fees we charge; 
● | the number of ports at which we provide services; and 
● | the number of customers we serve. 

 
While we were able to consistently generate net revenues from shipping agency business, this business was not profitable largely due to the rising operating costs associated with doing business in China including the appreciation of RMB against U.S. dollar. In light of consecutive years of operating losses and concerns raised by the U.S. regulators over our VIE structure, the Company decided to reorganize its business structure in fiscal year 2013. Commencing the later part of fiscal year 2013 and continuing in fiscal year 2014, we took various actions to restructure our business with the goal of achieving a certain level of profitability. As a result of these business reorganization efforts, we optimized our cost structure, reduced our dependency on shipping agency business, and shifted our shipping agency operation from our VIE to our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong.
 
In June 2013, the Company executed a 5-year global logistics service agreement with TEWOO Chemical & Light Industry Zhiyuan Trade Co., Ltd, which is controlled by Tianjin Zhiyuan Investment Group Co., Ltd (“Zhiyuan”). Zhiyuan is controlled by Mr. Zhong Zhang. Mr. Zhang purchased 1,800,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $3 million in April 2013 as approved by our Board of Directors and shareholders, which made Mr. Zhang our largest shareholder. Leveraging our business relationship with Zhiyuan, we expanded our service offerings to include shipping and chartering services and inland transportation management services to diversify our business. Leveraging our in-depth knowledge of the shipping industry, inland transportation management services are our tailored value-added solution developed for Zhiyuan to prevent high-priced bulk from damage or loss during its inland transportation from warehouses to factories. Given the industry norm of 12% of loss rate during transportation, our integrated inland transportation solution significantly reduces bulk losses and effectively addresses issues in the freight logistics chain. In August 2017, the Company entered into a supplemental agreement with Zhiyuan to extend the service period until September 1, 2018. Furthermore, after we have conducted an effective trial for Zhiyuan to reduce their bulk losses at the end of September 2014, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (“Tengda Northwest”) signed a contract with us to mitigate their bulk losses through our inland transportation management services. In July 2017 the Company entered into a supplemental agreement with Tengda Northwest to extend the service period until July 3, 2018.
 
In May 2014, the Company signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Qingdao Zhenghe Shipping Group Limited (“Zhenghe”), one of the largest shipping and transportation companies in China, to jointly explore mutually beneficial business development opportunities. In June 2014, Mr. Deming Wang, a major owner of Zhenghe, acquired 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In August 2014, the Company executed an agreement to acquire all of the equity of Longhe Ship Management (Hong Kong) Co., Limited (“LSM”) through its subsidiary, Sino-Global Shipping (HK) Inc. from Mr. Wang, to further broaden our scope of services and expertise in the ship management business. Due to market condition and high operating costs associated with this business line, the Company decided to suspend the ship management business starting from the fiscal year 2016.
 
On April 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Rong Yao International Shipping Limited, a Hong Kong company (the “Vessel Seller”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire, subject to a number of closing conditions, “Rong Zhou”, an 8,818 gross tonnage oil/chemical transportation tanker (the “Vessel”) from the Vessel Seller; and in connection therewith, the Company issued to the Vessel Seller 1.2 million shares of its restricted common stock representing $2,220,000 of the $10.5 million purchase price for the Vessel. On December 7, 2015, the Company and the Vessel Seller entered into a supplemental agreement to terminate the proposed Vessel acquisition.
 
The Company received $330,000 from the Vessel Seller in December 2015 in connection with the termination. The 1.2 million shares were returned to the Company on February 12, 2016 and were thereafter cancelled. In connection with the termination of the acquisition of Rong Yao International Shipping Limited (“Rong Yao”) on December 7, 2015, the Company realigned its development strategy and suspended shipping and chartering services until the economy is improved.

In January 2016, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Sino-Global Shipping LA Inc. (“Sino LA”), for the purpose of expanding its business to provide import security filing services with U.S Customs and Department of Homeland Security, on behalf of importers who ship goods into the U.S. and also providing inland transportation services to these importers in the U.S. On April 18, 2016, Sino LA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Yaxin International Co., Ltd. (“Yaxin”), pursuant to which Sino LA will provide logistics services to Yaxin, who ship goods via containers into the U.S. and places them on Amazon.com. The services include cargo forwarding, customs filing and declaration, trucking and other services.
 
In May 2016, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Shandong Hi-speed TEU Logistics Co., LTD. (“Shandong Hi-speed TEU”), which belongs to one of China’s largest state-owned enterprises, Shandong Hi-Speed Group Co., Ltd., to jointly establish a platform for coordinated transport between China and North America. The Company and Shandong Hi-speed TEU intend to cooperate in creating a standardized network that will unite carriers of the twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs in China via sea and rail and coordinate with parties in North America and Australia. The companies will serve both upstream and downstream customers through the platform, establish a door-to-door logistics and provide supply chain service.
 
During our fiscal year 2017, Sino continued to provide inland transportation services. In addition, Sino added freight logistics services and container trucking services as new business sectors to provide related transportation logistics services to customers in the U.S. and in China. Sino has signed cooperation agreements with COSCO China and Sinotrans, two state-owned enterprises of China, to provide freight logistics services and container trucking services to them in the U.S. To ensure effective and high-quality services providing to our customers in the U.S., Sino established a joint venture, ACH Trucking Center Corp., in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with U.S. local freight forwarder, Jetta Global Logistics Inc. This will increase our quantities of commodity transported and improve the quality of service provided to our customers in the eastern region of the U.S.

Business Segments
 
As of June 30, 2017, Sino-Global delivers inland transportation management services, freight logistics services and container trucking services to our customers.
 
Historically, the Company was in the business of solely providing shipping agency services. In fiscal year 2014, by leveraging the support of Sino-Global’s largest shareholder, Mr. Zhang and the company he controls, Zhiyuan Investment Group, the Company expanded its service platform to include shipping and chartering services during the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and inland transportation management services during the quarter ended December 31, 2013. We suspended shipping and chartering services as a result of the termination of the vessel acquisition in December 2015. With the acquisition of LSM in 2014, we added ship management services to our service platform but we suspended it together with shipping agency services in 2016 primarily due to market conditions. With the establishment of Sino-LA, we added cargo forwarding services to our service platform in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which is included in our inland transportation business line at the end of June 30, 2016. As we are developing our cargo forwarding services, the Company provides freight logistics services and container trucking services as two new business segments during this fiscal year.
Our Goals and Strategic Plan
 
By leveraging our fine reputation, extensive business relationships, technical ability and in-depth knowledge of the shipping industry, our goal is to further strengthen our position as a leading global logistic solution provider who offers innovative resolutions to better address complex issues in different aspects in the entire shipping and freight logistic chain.
 
We historically focused our business on providing our customers with customized shipping agency services. In the past, our business came predominately from our strong business relationships with our key strategic partners in China. To reduce our dependency on a single business line, we have leveraged, and will continue to leverage, our business relationships with strategic partners to introduce new service offerings to the market and to diversify our business. In light of the slowdown of the Chinese economy and its negative impact on the shipping business across Pacific Ocean, our strategic plan for the next 5 years is to continue to diversify our service mix and actively seek new growth opportunities to expand our business footprint in the U.S. market to reduce our dependency on the revenue generated from China. For decades, the shipping industry has been operated under traditional business models without many meaningful changes. Today, technological innovation has already played a big role in changing every conventional industry. We believe the internet will be a big part of the future logistics chain services and a transformative era in shipping and freight logistic business is coming. As an innovative solution provider, we plan to apply our technical ability, industry expertise and cutting-edge information technology in the conventional shipping business to better connect supply and demand and to develop seamless linkages in logistic chains.
 
After going through one and half years on our business restructuring, Sino changed its business models from providing traditional shipping agency services to providing solutions and services focused on inland transportation logistics between the U.S. and China, such as providing freight logistics services or container trucking services. As a result of our continued restructuring efforts, we turned an operating loss for the year ended June 30, 2016 to a profit for the year ended June 30, 2017. As shown in the table below, our current business operating revenue is primarily focused on inland transportation management services as compared to the two previous fiscal years.
 

 | Fiscal Year 2017 | | Fiscal Year 2016 | | Fiscal Year 2015

Key Services | Revenue | | % | | Revenue | | % | Revenue | | | % |

The business restructuring of Sino is gradually on track. During this process, we will continue to adjust and develop our strategic plans based on the change of business environment. In the future, we will provide more services to our customers, and we will use our internet platform to connect our worldwide businesses to our customers.

Our Customers
 
In light of our strategic relationship with Zhiyuan Investment Group that began with the signing of a 5-year global logistics service agreement in June 2013, we expanded our business platform to include additional service offerings. We started to provide inland transportation management services to a third-party customer, Tengda Northwest Ferroalloy Co., Ltd. (“Tengda Northwest”), during the quarter ended September 30, 2014. As we continue to diversify our service platform, we have reduced our dependency on a few customers which we provide freight logistics and container trucking services.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2017, three customers accounted for 26%, 24% and 19% of the Company’s revenues, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2016, two customers accounted for 31% and 27% of the Company’s revenues, respectively.
 
Our Suppliers
 
Our operations consist of working directly with our customers to understand in detail their needs and expectations and then managing local suppliers to ensure that our customers’ needs are met. Our major suppliers include Oldendorff Carriers, Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Gangcheng Dangerous Goods Logistics Co., Ltd. For the year ended June 30, 2017, two suppliers accounted for 42% and 11% of the total cost of revenue, respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2016, three suppliers accounted for 27%, 15% and 10% of the total cost of revenues, respectively.
Our Strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors:
 

● | Proven industry experience and problem-solving reputation. We are a non-asset based global shipping and freight logistics solution provider. Unlike a traditional shipping agent, we provide tailored solutions and value-added services to our customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. We believe that our years of successful track record of applying integrated solutions to complex issues in the global shipping logistics business gives us a competitive advantage in attracting large clients and helps us maintain strong long terms business relationship with them. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong leadership and a competent professional team. Our CEO is an industry veteran with more than thirty years of extensive industry experiences including ten years’ working for COSCO, one of the largest shipping companies in the world. Most of our employees have marine business experience, and many of our managers/chief operators served in other large Chinese shipping companies prior to joining us. With these professionals and experienced staff, we believe that we provide the best services to our customers at competitive prices. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive network and positive industry recognition. Doing business in China often requires a strong business network and support of key strategic partners. The Company served as one of the executive directors of China Association of Shipping Agencies & Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (CASA), the authoritative industry association in China. We are the only non-state-owned enterprise represented on the CASA board guiding the development of the industry. Our good reputation and industry recognition enables us to maintain strong relationships with our business partners and have an extensive network of contacts throughout the industry, which helps us gain necessary support to execute our business plans.

● | Lean organization and a flexible business model. Although we are a small business with limited resources, we have a cohesive and effective organizational structure with the goal of maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. Our unique flexible business model allows us to quickly respond to changing market demand and offer our customers innovative problem-solving solutions, quality customer service, and competitive prices to achieve greater market acceptance and gain additional market share. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S.-registered and NASDAQ-listed public company. We believe our status as a U.S. corporation gives us more credibility among existing and potential customers, suppliers, and other business partners than a privately owned company would have in our industry. Our ability to raise capital through the capital market or use our common stock as “currency” to facility potential merger and acquisition transactions can also help us carry out or accelerate our growth strategies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Opportunities
 
For more than thirty years, the shipping and freight logistic industry has been operated under traditional business models without meaningful change. Many of these business practices are inefficient and problematic; therefore, maintaining an innovative mindset is critical to achieving continuous business success and growth. We are a value-added logistics solution provider with successful past performance and individuals that have been in the industry for a long time. Instead of playing the traditional logistics broker role, we focus on providing technology solutions and innovative leading-edge services to bridge the asset-based world with the digital world. We shape our industry practice and profit model by analyzing wider developments both in the global markets and the technology industry so we can address unique problems that are currently pervasive across the shipping and freight logistics industry.
 
We believe we can capture the business opportunity and grow our business organically or through acquisitions or strategic alliance by:
 

● | Continuing to streamline our business operations and improve our operating efficiency through innovative technology, effective planning, budgeting, execution and cost control; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restructuring our business to focus on providing innovative technology based solution to our customers to promote our sustainable business growth; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing new service lines along the shipping and freight logistic industry value chain, and leveraging our relationships with COSCO, Zhiyuan Investment Group and other potential strategic business partners to expand our global business footprint. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Challenges
 
We face significant challenges when executing our strategy, including:
 

● | Given the complexity and length of restructuring our business, we face the challenge of generating sufficient cash from our current business activities to support our daily operations during the transition; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not be able to establish a separate department to solve critical issues in today’s shipping logistics industry; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not have or not be able to get the necessary funds to continue to expand our service and market our services successfully; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to respond to increasing competitive pressure on our growth and margins; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to gain further expertise and to serve new customers in new service areas; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | From time to time, we may have difficulty carrying out services effectively and in a profitable way due to the cyclical nature of the shipping industry, which could lead to a prolonged period of sluggish demand for our services; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to respond promptly to a changing regulatory environment, macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and competitive landscape; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing a winning business model takes time and a new business model may not be recognized by the market immediately. As a publicly traded company, management may be forced to fulfill near-term performance goals that may not be consistent with the Company’s long-term vision. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competition
 
The market segments that we serve do not have high entry barriers. There are many companies ranging from small to large in China that provide shipping and freight-related logistics services. At present, the state-owned companies in China still dominate the industry and generate a majority of the revenues in the industry. These companies have greater service capabilities, a larger customer base and more financial, marketing, network and human resources than we do. Most of them concentrate their business on shipping agency services to meet general market demand. However, we focus on providing tailored solutions and value-added services to select high-profile customers to drive effectiveness and control in related aspects throughout the entire shipping and freight logistic chain. As a boutique company that provides specialized services with limited resources and history, we face intense competition in the particular market segments that we serve. Our ability to be successful in our industry depends on our deep understanding of the complexity of industry issues and challenges and our technical ability to develop best solutions to respond to the identified issues and provide effective problem-solving strategies to our targeted customers to achieve the fastest and most cost-effective outcomes. Our value-added services and innovative approaches are highly recognized by our customers, which helps us to gain additional market share and compete effectively with the companies that may be better capitalized than we are or may provide services we do not or cannot provide to our customers.

Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we have 24 employees, 14 of whom are based in China. Of the total, four are in management, twelve are in operations, five are in finance and accounting and three are in administration and technical support. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Recent Development
 
Sino has signed joint project agreements with Sinotrans Guangxi and COSFRE Beijing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The project will involve a shift from the current bulk cargo transportation model to a containerized model. The Company has started a trial by facilitating the delivery of Sulphur from Long Beach, California, in the U.S., to Fangcheng Port, Guangxi, PRC and ultimately to the warehouse of the customer. At the end of the fiscal year 2017, there was no revenue or cost of revenue recognized from this business model. Management expects the transportation of cargo via a containerized model will become a new business segment in incoming years.
 
On August 24, 2017, Sino signed a marketing promoting service agreement with COSCO Qingdao. According to this agreement, COSCO Qingdao will help Sino to promote shipping and multimodal transportation, including inland trucking container transportation services, switch bill of lading and freight collection services.
 
Sino plans to establish a subsidiary in Ningbo, China, to connect with local small commodities businesses to establish overseas warehouses for them. Sino will provide a service model similar to Amazon, including unloading commodities from the U.S. ports, providing transportation services, providing warehouse space in the U.S., and providing inland transportation logistics services to the door of the end customers.
