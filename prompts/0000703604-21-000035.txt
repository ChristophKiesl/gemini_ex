ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Lawson Products, Inc. (“Lawson”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated in Illinois in 1952, and reincorporated in Delaware in 1982. Lawson serves the industrial, commercial, institutional and government Maintenance, Repair and Operations ("MRO") market. 
Vision
Our vision is to be our customers' first choice for maintenance, repair and operational solutions that improve their operating performance. We plan to achieve our vision by working closely with our customers to maintain and enhance their operations by providing them with quality products, superior service and innovative solutions. 
Industry and Competition
The MRO market is comprised of companies that buy and stock products in bulk and supply these products to customers on an as needed basis. The customer benefits from our knowledge and the convenience of ordering smaller quantities maintained by us. We estimate that total current annual revenue generated by the North American MRO marketplace exceeds $150 billion. 
There is a significant amount of competitive fragmentation by geography and product within the industry. We encounter competition from several national distributors and manufacturers and a large number of regional and local distributors. Some competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, handle more extensive lines of merchandise, operate larger facilities and price some merchandise more competitively than we do. 
Segments
We operate in two reportable segments, the Lawson operating segment and the Bolt operating segment.
Lawson Segment
Through the Lawson operating segment, we deliver quality products to our customers and offer them extensive product knowledge, product application expertise and Vendor Managed Inventory ("VMI") services. Our broad geographic sales coverage allows us to serve large multi-location customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. We compete for business primarily by offering a value-added service approach in which our highly trained sales representatives manage the product inventory for our customers. The VMI model makes it less likely that our customers will unintentionally run out of a product while optimizing their inventory levels. 
Sales orders are primarily generated from our sales representatives on behalf of customers; however, customers can also order directly from our website or through our customer service team via fax or phone. We ship products to customers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. We normally ship to our customers within one day of order placement. 
Our MRO distribution process normally entails the purchase of product from suppliers in bulk for delivery to our packaging and distribution facility in McCook, Illinois (“McCook Facility”) for possible repackaging, labeling or cross-docking. Product is then either stocked at the McCook Facility or delivered to one of our strategically located distribution centers. As orders are received, product is picked, packed and shipped to our customers. Many factors affect the efficiency of this process including the physical design of the distribution centers, the extent of automation, routing logistics, the number of times the product needs to be handled, transportation costs and the flexibility to meet the specific requirements of our customers.
On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired Partsmaster from NCH Corporation. Partsmaster is a leading maintenance, MRO solutions provider that serves approximately 16,000 customers and approximately 200 sales representatives. The acquisition was made primarily to expand the Company's sales coverage, expand product lines, add experienced sales representatives, and leverage the Company's infrastructure.

Bolt Segment
The Bolt operating segment primarily delivers products to its customers through 14 branches located in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia, Canada. Bolt generates sales from walk up business at its branch locations and through its sales team, phone, fax or the Internet. Bolt inventory is delivered to the packaging and distribution facility in Calgary, Alberta, and then distributed to each branch location. Sales generated via its sales team or through phone, fax or Internet orders are primarily shipped from one of the branch locations to the customer. The majority of Bolt's customers are located in the geographic vicinity of the branches. Bolt generally does not offer VMI services to its customers. Bolt generated 11.0% of the Company's annual 2020 sales. Bolt product offerings are listed on the Bolt website and are available in each of the branch locations. 
Customers
During 2020, the Lawson segment sold products to over 84,000 identified customers and the Bolt segment sold products to approximately 12,000 identified customers in addition to the walk up customers at its 14 branch locations. Our largest customer accounted for approximately three percent of net sales. In 2020, approximately 81% of our net sales were generated in the United States and approximately 19% in Canada. The percentage of sales in Canada slightly decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the inclusion of Partsmaster sales, the majority of which occurred in the US. Our customers operate in a variety of industries including automotive repair, commercial vehicle maintenance, government, manufacturing, food processing, distribution, construction, oil and gas, mining, wholesale, service and others. Although seasonality is not significant in our business, due to fewer selling days and less activity during the holiday season, net sales in the fourth quarter are historically lower than the first three quarters of the year.
Our customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products from small repair shops to large national and governmental accounts. Historically, we have been very effective selling to and servicing small and medium sized customer locations that value our service approach. 
Products
Our product offerings are listed on our websites and in catalogs distributed to our customers. Sales percentages by broad product categories of our product mix in 2020 were as follows:

Product Category | Percentage
Fastening systems | 22% 
Cutting tools and abrasives | 14% 
Fluid power | 13% 
Specialty chemicals | 11% 
Electrical | 10% 
Aftermarket automotive supplies | 7% 
Safety | 6% 
Welding and metal repair | 2% 
Other | 15% 
 | 100% 

The Lawson segment offers over 357,000 different products for sale of which over 89,000 products are maintained in our distribution centers. The Partsmaster acquisition contributed approximately 201,000 different products for sale including items not stored in their distribution center. We strive to carry sufficient inventory to ensure product availability and rapid processing of customer orders. Accurate forecasting of customer demand is essential to establish the proper level of inventory for each product. Inventory levels need to be sufficient to meet customer demand while avoiding the costs of stocking excess items. 
During 2020, our Lawson segment purchased products from approximately 3,100 suppliers and no single supplier accounted for more than four percent of our purchases. The loss of one of our core suppliers could affect our operations by hindering our ability to provide full service to our customers.
Our quality control department tests our product offerings to ensure they meet our customers' specifications. We recommend solutions to help customers maximize product performance and avoid costly product failures. Our engineering

department provides technical support for our products and offers on-site problem solutions. It also develops and presents product safety and technical training seminars tailored to meet our customers' needs. Safety Data Sheets are maintained electronically and are available to our customers on our website. 
Bolt offers approximately 40,000 different core products for sale of which approximately 19,000 products are maintained in the Calgary distribution center. The majority of inventory is kept in the Calgary distribution center, with each branch maintaining appropriate inventory levels for their business needs. 
Human Capital Resources
General Employee Information
Our organization supports a culture of continuous improvement and emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of our customers. We require our employees to act with integrity in every aspect of our business while encouraging them to be results driven, team oriented and progressive. 
On December 31, 2020, our combined workforce included approximately 1,910 individuals, comprised of approximately 1,300 in sales and marketing, approximately 470 in operation and distribution and approximately 140 in management and administration. Approximately 1,750 of the 1,910 individuals are within the Lawson segment and the remaining are within Bolt. Approximately 8% of the workforce is covered by three collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and their collective bargaining organizations are good. 
Sales Team
On December 31, 2020, the Lawson sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 1,300 individuals focused on servicing existing customers, identifying new customers, providing customer service support and providing on-site customer service. Of the total sales team, 1,090 are sales representatives who are primarily organized into geographical regions. The performance of each region is the responsibility of a Regional Sales Director. Each region is further divided into geographically defined districts. The performance of each district is the responsibility of a District Sales Manager who reports to the Regional Sales Director. Our District Sales Managers work with the sales representatives to generate sales from new and existing customers. Lawson also has a team dedicated to the acquisition of larger national and mid-market accounts and a team dedicated to serving governmental accounts. The national accounts are comprised of multi-location customers with a national scope.
Sales force growth is a driver of our business. Increased sales coverage throughout the United States and Canada directly impacts our success as an organization. The Company is focused on identifying and recruiting individuals who are a good fit for our sales organization and providing them the tools needed to succeed. When these employees are hired, they participate in a training program to learn the products and processes of Lawson and also the history, values and culture of the Company. This sales training program allows the new sales representatives to assimilate into the Company and learn the most successful ways to call on potential customers, maintain relationships with existing customers, and provide the proper products and VMI services to ensure that the customers needs are met. 
The Lawson sales team receives education in the best uses of products, enabling them to provide customized solutions to address customers' needs including technical expertise and on-site problem resolution. The VMI services Lawson offers primarily consist of ordering the right products in the optimal quantity for the customer and stocking the product for customers when the product is delivered. The sales team also periodically provides product presentations to customers that are designed to demonstrate how the products can improve their productivity. Additionally, Lawson sales representatives offer customized storage systems for improved organization and a more efficient work-flow. 
While recruitment of new sales representatives is important, the goal of this process is to ensure the sales representatives who are brought on board will be members of the Lawson team for the long term. Our experience has proven that a sales representative becomes more successful and generates more sales for the Company the longer they are a part of Lawson. Longer tenured sales representatives form deeper relationships with customers, which results in customers relying on the Lawson sales representative for a larger share of their MRO needs. Reducing sales force churn and ensuring sales representatives can grow and reach their full potential over the long term is a focus of the Lawson leadership team. The sales leadership team is in regular contact with Regional Sales Directors, District Sales Managers and experienced sales representatives to discuss the challenges our sales representatives face in generating sales and how the Company can support them. The Company regularly reviews the performance of sales representatives and determines how to manage underperforming sales representatives and territories.

In August 2020, we acquired Partsmaster, a leading MRO distributor from NCH Corporation ("NCH"). At the time of acquisition Partsmaster had approximately 200 sales representatives throughout the United States and Canada. Partsmaster is an example of the acquisition strategy pursued by Lawson in recent years. Our acquisition strategy targets companies who are a good cultural fit and include organizations whose sales representatives will improve our sales coverage in underserved territories and allow us to generate additional sales by leveraging their existing customer relationships.
The majority of Bolt sales are made from its 14 branch locations. Bolt has approximately 23 sales territory managers who serve companies and professional tradespeople throughout Western Canada. In 2017, Bolt began requiring members of the sales teams to be certified as Certified Sales Professionals for the Canadian Professional Sales Association. All newly-hired sales team members are required to receive and maintain the same certification. 
COVID-19 Impact on Human Capital
The Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is evidence that the Company can take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our employees and still fulfill the needs of its customers and other stakeholders. The unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the ability of Lawson MRO sales reps and the Bolt branch locations to fulfill their duties during 2020. The second quarter 2020 performance of the Company was negatively impacted as state and local governments throughout the United States and Canada imposed strict COVID-19 related restrictions, including shutdowns of nonessential businesses and stay-at-home orders. The Lawson MRO business model relies upon customer interaction as well as a consistent schedule of onsite visits by our sales representatives to customer locations. The Bolt business model relies on foot traffic in its branch locations. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as social distancing guidelines and government mandated shelter in place orders, have negatively impacted the ability of our sales reps to visit our customers and for foot traffic to return to our Bolt branch locations, resulting in an overall negative impact on our business. A large portion of Lawson corporate employees began to work remotely at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 to limit exposure to the virus. Many of these employees continue to work from home. 
In response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales representatives contacted customers via phone, e-mail and other electronic means, who were deemed essential businesses and therefore allowed to remain open during this time. As COVID-19 related restrictions were relaxed, Lawson MRO sales representatives began to safely visit customers and call on new customers, while following social distancing guidelines and limiting potential exposure to the virus. In addition, Bolt branch locations began to offer curbside pickup in the second quarter of 2020 and continue to do so. As COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed, the Company was able to operate in a more stable environment. Lawson MRO sales representatives have continued to safely visit customer locations, develop strong relationships and provide excellent service to existing customers, and generate new customer relationships while following COVID-19 related restrictions and social distancing guidelines. Bolt branch locations continue to safely operate while following social distancing guidelines and allowing customers into stores. The Company will continue to navigate through the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the safety of its team members.
Strategic Focus
In 2021, we intend to grow our sales organically, pursue acquisitions and further improve our operations to make Lawson our customers' first choice for products, services and solutions that improve their operating performance. 
Our sales are impacted by the size of our sales team, their productivity and their territorial coverage. Our plan to expand the sales force is designed by identifying under-served territories that offer the greatest growth potential, locate and recruit talented sales representatives, provide them with the proper training, and successfully integrate them into our organization.
To acquire the best new sales talent and prepare them for success, we have developed an extensive talent acquisition strategy. We use both internal and external resources to identify and recruit the best available sales talent. As we increase our sales coverage, we anticipate a short-term decrease in average sales per day per sales representative, as new representatives build up customer relationships in their territories. However, we believe that these short-term investments will result in future opportunities as we leverage the positive impact of top-line growth against our operating costs which are fixed to a significant extent.
We are also focused on increasing the productivity of our sales representatives. We strive to empower our sales representatives with the training, technology and support they need to maximize their sales potential while providing our customers with superior service and making it easy for them to do business with us. 
In addition to organic growth, we plan to continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will be financially accretive to our organization. Lawson plans to continue to explore growth opportunities in the MRO space that provide different channels to reach customers, increase sales and generate positive results.

In order to improve our operations, we utilize a Lean Six Sigma approach, which is a set of tools that allow a project team to analyze and improve selected business processes. The project teams work with the process owners to develop statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the process, document the current components and process flow, examine the root cause of defects and effect of current operations, design and implement new ways to improve performance and then measure the results for effectiveness. The Lean Six Sigma process is ingrained in our culture as we have had over 100 employees complete Lean Six Sigma training over the past five years and plan to continue this training program in the years to come. 
 We believe our emphasis on continuous improvement will lead to further reductions in error rates, increased processing speed, reduction in cycle times, standardization of procedures and elimination of waste. This will enable us to become a more efficient and effective organization which provides our customers with the best purchasing experience possible.
The acquisition of Partsmaster represents an important step in our acquisition strategy. Partsmaster is a strong strategic fit with a successful VMI business model and product offerings complementary to the Company. The addition of the Partsmaster sales force has increased our coverage throughout the United States and Canada and will offer potential for combined company sales, and continue to leverage the existing customer relationships in order to grow our business.
