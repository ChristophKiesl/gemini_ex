ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our Business 
 
We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of highly resistant cancers and viruses. We have three core technologies, based substantially on discoveries made at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson or MDA). We have four drug candidates, three of which have now shown human activity in clinical trials.
 
During 2020, three of those drug candidates accounted for five clinical trials in the US and Europe. Two of those trials are ongoing externally funded studies of WP1066 in brain tumors. Two of our internally funded Phase 1 clinical trials have essentially concluded. The trial for Annamycin in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) successfully met its safety endpoint, and the trial for WP1220 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) demonstrated an objective response rate of 45% and a clinical benefit rate of 100%. An additional Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Annamycin in AML is also internally funded and is currently ongoing. In 2021, we anticipate the initiation of five new clinical trials in addition to the three trials continuing from 2020.
 
In late 2020, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to proceed with an additional Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin for the treatment of sarcoma lung metastases and we are preparing to begin this trial in the US. We also plan to seek approval to begin a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Annamycin in combination with Ara-C for the treatment of AML in Europe. These two new trials will be internally funded. We expect a second Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin in sarcoma lung metastases to be primarily investigator-funded in Europe and we plan to seek a collaborative partner to support a Phase 2 clinical study of WP1220 in CTCL. Finally, we are working to initiate a clinical trial of WP1122, in either a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial in COVID-19 or a physician-sponsored clinical trial for a cancer indication, or both. The ultimate course of action depends on the outcome of additional regulatory and preclinical work. These trials may be internally or externally funded, depending on the timing and nature of the studies. In summary, we had five clinical trials underway or concluded in 2020 and we now expect up to eight clinical trials to be underway or approved in 2021, including physician-sponsored trials related to our drug candidates for which we are not actively involved.
 
By "internally funded” we mean that the primary costs of the preclinical activity and clinical trials are funded by us. “Externally funded” drug candidates include those for which preclinical work is performed by external collaborators and for which clinical trials are physician-sponsored. For externally funded research, any grant funds that support such preclinical work or clinical trials and most of the associated expenses do not flow through our financial statements. We do provide drug product and other minor supporting activities for externally funded preclinical activities and clinical trials.
 
We recently announced collaborations with third parties to assist us in developing potential treatments for certain viral diseases, including, potentially, COVID-19. During 2020, we announced that in vitro testing corroborated the antiviral potential of WP1122, including for the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Subsequently, we had written discussions with the FDA regarding the clinical development of WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on guidance from the FDA, we believe that we need to demonstrate efficacy in a COVID-19 animal model in order to proceed with an IND for COVID-19 clinical trials in the US. Therefore, the timing of any such clinical trial activity in the US is subject to the limited access we have to validated in vivo efficacy testing. For this reason, we are also evaluating opportunities to pursue COVID-19 clinical development outside the US. The IND-enabling preclinical work already completed for WP1122 is mostly similar to the preclinical work we originally planned as part of developing WP1122 for cancer indications. Accordingly, we intend to apply for an IND or its foreign equivalent for WP1122 in either an antiviral or cancer indication, or both, during 2021.
 
Based on the results of our clinical activity thus far, we have further narrowed our internal development focus to our nearest term opportunities, especially where human activity has been shown in clinical trials. This focus is primarily on preclinical and clinical activities with Annamycin, preclinical activities associated with an intravenous formulation of WP1066 and IND-enabling studies of WP1122. We intend to rely on external funding, to the extent available. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have internally accelerated development of the WP1122 portfolio with a combined effort of internally and externally funded preclinical work to support an IND application with the FDA or an international regulatory body for the treatment of COVID-19 or a cancer indication or both. 
 
Of our three clinical stage drug candidates, Annamycin is currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in Poland. We recently received clearance from the FDA to proceed with a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin as a potential treatment for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) metastasized to the lungs. WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator (p-STAT3 inhibitor or, simply, STAT3 inhibitor) is intended to target a wide range of tumors, including brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) and pediatric brain tumors (like diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or DIPG, and medulloblastoma), as well as pancreatic cancer. It is currently in two physician-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trials, one for adult GBM and another for pediatric brain tumors (including DIPG and medulloblastoma). We began and completed a "proof-of-concept" Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 in Poland for a third drug, WP1220 (a molecule in the WP1066 portfolio), for the topical treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We are actively seeking collaboration with a strategic partner in the near term for external funding for the continued development of WP1220 in a Phase 2 clinical trial as a topical therapy for CTCL. If we are not successful in this outreach, we may choose to use internal funds to generate additional human data to facilitate such outreach efforts. We are also engaged in preclinical development of additional drug candidates, including additional Immune/Transcription Modulators, as well as antimetabolites, targeting glycolysis and glycosylation.
 
We consider Annamycin to be a "next generation" anthracycline, unlike any currently approved anthracyclines, as it is designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms with little to no cardiotoxicity (the efficacy of all currently approved anthracyclines is limited by both multidrug resistance and cardiotoxicity). We have received an independent expert cardiology assessment confirming the absence of cardiotoxicity in the first 19 patients treated with Annamycin in both our US and European Phase 1 clinical trials. Annamycin is currently in one Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Europe, and the Phase 1 portion of another Phase 1/2 AML trial in the US has been concluded, subject to final database lock and closure. The FDA requested that we demonstrate that Annamycin could be safely administered to patients up to the lifetime maximum allowable level of anthracycline (LTMAD) established by the FDA and the trial met this primary endpoint. The FDA established the LTMAD because of concerns about cardiotoxicity associated with currently approved anthracyclines when administered above the LTMAD. Of the first 19 patients in our trials, 11 have been treated above the LTMAD (one patient received more than double the LTMAD) and none have shown evidence of any cardiotoxicity. As a result of discussions with the FDA, we will focus on establishing a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in our trial in Europe, and, as requested by the FDA, we will generate additional safety and efficacy data.

The trial in Poland is in its fifth cohort, where patients are being treated at 240 mg/m2. Patient 2 in this cohort experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), related to liver function, secondarily related to concomitant medication not being withheld. Although that DLT resolved, in accordance with the trial protocol, the cohort was expanded and has now enrolled a total of five patients. In March 2021, patient 4 in this cohort experienced a similar DLT and, accordingly, no additional patients will be enrolled at this dose level beyond the five patients enrolled to date. The DLT for Patient 4 is being monitored and, per protocol, other patients in this cohort are permitted to continue to receive the full dose of Annamycin, at the discretion of their physicians and with the patients being notified of the reported DLTs. 
 
We are planning to amend the protocol for this trial to allow exploration of an intermediate dose level between the 210 mg/m2 dose in the fourth cohort and the current 240 mg/m2 dose level, in order to establish the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), which may be the same. While this will establish an MTD for Annamycin in AML and inform the starting dose in our planned trials in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases, we do not believe it will limit the dose escalation in our STS trials. Because of the different indication and differences in dosing regimen, we expect to determine a separate MTD in the Phase 1 portion of the STS trials. Once the MTD in the single agent AML trial is established, we currently plan to begin the expansion Phase 2 portion of this trial with relapsed patients at the RP2D, in order to determine the potential efficacy of Annamycin as a second line, single agent treatment for relapsed AML. Following on our preclinical research, we also intend to begin the Phase 1 portion of an AML trial using Annamycin in combination with Ara-C, a drug commonly used as a single agent and in combination chemotherapy for AML.
 
A preliminary review of the data in the completed cohorts in both trials, which is subject to update, indicates that patients received an average of 3+ and a maximum of 9 prior regimens. Thus far in the completed cohorts of our US and European single agent AML trials, there are 13 relapsed patients who were enrolled after one or more relapses from the prior regimens. Of these, 38% had either a CRi, PR or Bridge to Transplant. We view this as encouraging, because recruitment in the expansion Phase 2 will be limited to patients with no more than a single relapse. This is in contrast to the Phase 1 portion of the trial, where, in order to accelerate recruitment, we included a majority of patients who were primarily refractory or who had two or more relapses from alternate therapy. We believe this is significant because patients who are either refractory or have had two or more relapses are considered to be less likely to respond to therapy and especially to a single agent therapy. As a result and considering that all patients in Phase 2 will be treated at the RP2D, we believe the overall response in the expansion Phase 2 may be better than the overall response in the Phase 1 portion of the trial, although we cannot be certain that actual results will reflect this.
 
Our preclinical work on Annamycin demonstrated activity against certain cancers metastasized to the lungs. In December 2020, we disclosed that the FDA allowed our IND to go into effect to study Annamycin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases. This allows us to begin a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the U.S. for patients with soft tissue sarcoma that has metastasized to the lungs after first-line therapy for their disease. We expect this trial to begin in the first half of 2021. Later in December 2020, we disclosed that the FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to Annamycin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, in addition to the existing ODD for Annamycin in relapsed or refractory AML. On February 2, 2021, we announced that a preclinical study in animals has confirmed a significant therapeutic benefit of Annamycin against metastatic osteosarcoma. As of day 130 of the study, the survival rate for animals treated with Annamycin was 100%, compared with only 10% for untreated animals. Computerized tomography scans demonstrated that animals treated with Annamycin exhibited suppression of tumor growth and not a single death was observed in the treated animals, whereas observed tumor burden was believed to have contributed to the rapid death of 90% of untreated animals. We believe this data is a promising indication of the possibility of Annamycin’s impact on other cancers metastasized to the lungs. We caution that this is preclinical animal data and we can provide no assurance that we will see similar results in our planned clinical trials.

WP1066 is one of several Immune/Transcription Modulators designed to stimulate the immune response to tumors by inhibiting the errant activity of Regulatory T-Cells (TRegs) while also inhibiting key oncogenic transcription factors, including p-STAT3 (phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), c-Myc (a celluar signal transducer named after a homologous avian virus called Myelocytomatosis) and HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1a). These transcription factors are widely sought targets that are believed to contribute to an increase in cell survival and proliferation, and the angiogenesis (coopting vasculature for blood supply), invasion, metastasis and inflammation associated with tumors. They may also play a role in the inability of immune checkpoint inhibitors to affect more resistant tumors. WP1066 is currently in two US physician-sponsored Phase 1 trials, one at MD Anderson for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) in adults and another at Emory University for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. 
 
The trial at MD Anderson is in the fourth and final cohort in the dose escalation phase. In the first quarter of 2021, we were notified that the physician sponsoring this trial is leaving MDA. We cannot be assured that this trial will continue at MDA after her departure. Several additional institutions have expressed an interest in sponsoring similar research on WP1066 in brain tumors, so to help ensure the potential continuation of this important research, regardless of the sponsoring institution, we have requested the IND for this trial to be transferred into our name with the FDA, although we can provide no assurance as to when, or if, this transfer will be completed. While we are making arrangements to continue this research in additional physician-sponsored trials, we expect that continued research on WP1066 in adult GBM will be temporarily delayed in 2021.
 
The Emory trial for pediatric brain tumors has now treated three patients in the first cohort. The third and last patient in the second cohort has begun treatment at the dose level of 6mg/kg. In that trial, one of the patients in the first cohort with DIPG showed an apparent response to the treatment with both clinical improvement and radiologic reduction of tumor size. We caution that this is preliminary data, and no conclusions should be drawn from this single event. Another physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial is being considered for the treatment of GBM with WP1066 in combination with radiation, although no assurances can be given that such trial will begin.
 
We are also developing new compounds designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which we believe may provide an opportunity to cut off the fuel supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high level of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells. A key drawback to 2-DG is its lack of drug-like properties, including a short circulation time and poor tissue/organ distribution characteristics. Our lead Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitor, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG that appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by increasing its circulation time and improving tissue/organ distribution. New research also points to the potential for 2-DG to be capable of enhancing the usefulness of checkpoint inhibitors. Considering that 2-DG lacks sufficient drug-like properties to be practical in a clinical setting, we believe WP1122 has the opportunity to become an important drug to potentiate existing therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors.
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, several independent research teams identified that 2-DG may have the potential to treat COVID-19, as well as other diseases caused by coronaviruses. Similar to the dependence of many tumors on glucose, viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are highly dependent on both glycolysis and glycosylation (and, therefore, glucose) in order to successfully invade host cells and proliferate. It is on this basis that we have established an antiviral drug development program focused on WP1122 and its analogs. We are in the process of identifying the best possible pathway to begin a clinical trial in either COVID-19 or cancer patients or both in the first half of 2021.
 
The spread of COVID-19 has caused significant volatility in US and international markets, including Poland, where we conduct some of our clinical trials, and Italy, where our drug supply is produced. There has been limited interruption of our drug supply, and most Polish clinics where we are conducting trials are limiting access for monitoring activities, which could delay our ability to collect data and authorize new patient recruitment. Additionally, we believe COVID-19 has materially slowed the ability of approved sites to recruit patients for our trials. This could worsen or be alleviated at any time. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the US and international economies and, as such, we are unable to determine if it will have a material impact to our operations. Recently, we have experienced a limited increase in activity with regard to recruitment of new patients in Poland. Additionally, we believe that the potential for impact to our supply chain due to COVID-19 will be reduced as vaccine production normalizes throughout the industry. In light of current US trends with respect to COVID-19, we cannot determine whether COVID-19 will materially impact recruitment for current or future US based trials.

We do not have manufacturing facilities and all manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization. Our overall strategy is to seek potential outlicensing opportunities with larger pharmaceutical companies who are better suited for the marketing, sales and distribution of our drugs once approved.
 
Mission and Strategy Overview
 
Moleculin is focused on developing treatments for highly resistant cancers and viruses. For cancers, these include AML, GBM, CTCL, STS metastasized to the lungs, pancreatic cancer, other vital organ metastases, and others. With regard to viruses, our current focus is the possible treatment of COVID-19, while additional pre-clinical work has demonstrated possible activity against HIV, Zika, and Dengue fever. Our diverse pipeline of technologies was built around the recognition that many highly resistant tumors tend to have a common set of traits, including an increase in multidrug resistant mechanisms, an evasion of the natural immune system, a marked upregulation of certain key oncogenic transcription factors and an increased dependence on glycolysis for energy production. Many of these traits are also common to certain viruses and we believe each of these elements may be addressed by the unique and innovative mechanisms introduced by one or more of our three core technologies. As detailed within, although we have conducted much preclinical and early-stage clinical work that we consider very promising, there is no guarantee that any future study will be conducted or will be successful, or that our product candidates will ultimately be successfully commercialized.
 
We believe our technologies provide an opportunity to help the many patients in need of alternative therapies, both as single agents and in combination with numerous existing technologies that often fail as tumors present immediate or acquired resistance. We believe showing even modest improvements in highly resistant cancers and viruses may lead to accelerated approval pathways, potentially reducing the time and capital required to ultimately realize success.
 
In February 2019, we announced our outlicensing agreement to WPD Pharmaceuticals, an entity associated with one of our co-founders, Dr. Waldemar Priebe, which was amended in March 2021. This agreement provides WPD with territorial rights to certain smaller countries in mainly Eastern Europe and Western Asia in exchange for their agreeing to provide $6.5 million or more of funding, either directly or through the guarantees of grants, to our development efforts over the eight-year period commencing with our initial execution of the agreement in February 2019. WPD recently announced their facilitation of a grant equivalent to $1.5 million USD to the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute to fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases. The grant-funded clinical trial will be led by Prof. Piotr Rutkowski, MD, PhD, Head of Department of Soft Tissue/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw, Poland. As we continue to generate additional human data, we intend to pursue additional strategic collaborations on a regional basis for each of our drug candidates.
 
This increase in potential outside funding should allow us to concentrate our internal resources primarily on Annamycin, and our active p-STAT3 inhibitors, WP1066 and WP1220. This allows us to prioritize our internal funding to core clinical trials that we think may lead to an accelerated approval pathway and/or a strategic licensing opportunity. Accordingly, we have increased our focus on clinical trial pathways for Annamycin, WP1066 and WP1220. We have now seen human activity in these three drug candidates that we think is capable of supporting an accelerated approval pathway with continued positive developments in the respective clinical trials. We are also committed to spending on the WP1122 program to potentially enable a cancer and/or a COVID-19 related IND.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Drug development – from discovery to approved drug – can take decades. With this in mind, and in light of the fact that US patent terms begin on the date of filing and run for 20 years, alternative means of establishing market exclusivity are common in the drug development industry. Orphan Drug designation (ODD) from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000 cases per year in the United States. A drug that is approved for an orphan-designated indication may receive market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of the New Drug Application (NDA). During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan-designated indication. Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) will not bar approval of a product with a different active moiety for the same indication or a product with the same moiety for a different indication. Additionally, ODE will not preclude FDA approval of another product with the same moiety for the same orphan-designated indication under certain circumstances, including if the subsequent product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. ODD and ODE are also available from the European Union (EU). ODD in the EU is generally available for drug products intended to treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made. If the orphan-designated product continues to meet the criteria for orphan designation at approval, the approval for an orphan-designated indication conveys a 10-year exclusivity period, during which the competent authorities in the EU may not accept another marketing authorization application and may not grant another marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product (i.e., a medicinal product with an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features and acts via the same mechanisms) for the same therapeutic indication. The 10-year period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for the ODD, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. In the EU, ODE does not preclude granting a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, if that medicinal product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product.
 
Independently from potential patent protection, in 2018 we received ODD from the FDA for Annamycin for the treatment of AML and, in 2019 we received FDA ODD for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma. Separately, the FDA may also grant market exclusivity of 5 years for newly approved new chemical entities (which we believe our drug candidates will be considered to be), which would for a period of time preclude submission of any Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic version of the product or any 505(b)(2) NDA for a product with the same active moiety that seeks to rely on its similarity to our product for an abbreviated approval pathway, as well as delay approval of such applications. There can be no assurance that such exclusivity will be granted, nor does the exclusivity, if granted, block approval of a “full” NDA (i.e., an NDA that does not rely on similarity to our product) for a competing product. Furthermore, we were granted Fast Track Designation for Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in April 2019 by the FDA. Fast Track Designation, which is intended to expedite drug development and approval, is granted to drugs intended to treat serious conditions, where data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.
 
We have been granted royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive licenses for the patent and technology rights related to all three of our drug technologies, as these patent rights are owned by MD Anderson. The Annamycin drug substance is no longer covered by any original patent protection, however in June 2019, we submitted new provisional patent applications derived from the Patent Cooperation Treaty or PCT for synthetic processes for lyophilized Annamycin and for reconstitution of our Annamycin drug product candidate. If the non-provisional patent applications and subsequent PCT applications are approved, for which we can provide no assurance, this would potentially provide patent protection for Annamycin through June 2040.

The US patents we license from MD Anderson that have been granted expire from 2024 to 2029. MD Anderson manages the patent process related to the technology subject to our license agreements worldwide with advice from and funded by us, according to the license agreements. Additional patents pending, including licenses being negotiated in the ordinary course of business and currently licensed from MD Anderson, may provide additional potential protection to our drug portfolio, however we can provide no assurance that such patents or additional licenses will be granted or with regard to the extent of protection they might provide.
 
Our Drug Candidates
 
Annamycin
 
One of our lead product candidates is Annamycin, for which FDA allowed an IND to go into effect for a Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML and granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of AML, which means the agency believes we have established a medically plausible basis for using the drug for AML. We recently concluded the Phase 1 portion of the US clinical trial and a similar Phase 1/2 trial in Europe continues and is in its fifth cohort. We are planning a potential pivotal Phase 2 AML trial once sufficient clinical data is established in this European trial. Based on new research findings resulting from our sponsored research at MD Anderson, we are also preparing to begin an AML clinical trial in Europe for the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C, as well as clinical trials in both the US and EU (with the EU trial being physician-sponsored) for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma lung metastases with Annamycin as a single agent.
Prior Development 
 
We took over the development of Annamycin after two prior drug development companies, Callisto Pharmaceuticals and Aronex Pharmaceuticals, ceased development work for various clinical and business reasons, leading to the termination of the INDs by the FDA. The basis for our decision to proceed notwithstanding the most recent prior developer’s abandoning the project is that we believe the actual clinical data as reported by Dr. Robert Shepard, our Chief Medical Officer and the prior developer’s Chief Medical Officer at the time of the clinical trials, to the 2009 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and as further reported by the Principal Investigators of the clinical trials in a peer-reviewed journal article (Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 August; 13(4): 430-434. doi:10.1016/j.clml.2013.03.015.), supports further clinical evaluation. In addition, the conclusion published in the 2013 Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia Journal article was that “Single agent nanomolecular liposomal annamycin appears to be well-tolerated and (demonstrates) evidence of clinical activity as a single agent in refractory adult ALL.” As reported in both the ASCO presentation and the 2013 journal article referenced, the definition of efficacy is based on the following Response Criteria: “Response criteria were achievement of CR defined as ≤5% blasts, granulocyte count of ≥1×109/L, and a platelet count of ≥100×109/L. Partial remission was defined the same as CR, except for the presence of 6% to 25% blasts. Hematologic improvement was defined as for CR but platelet count of ≥1×109/L.” The summary of patient response from the 2013 journal article reads: “After determining the MTD, a 10-patient phase IIA was conducted. Eight of the patients completed one cycle of the three days of treatment at the MTD. Of these, five (62%) demonstrated encouraging anti-leukemic activity with complete clearing of circulating peripheral blasts. Three of these subjects also cleared bone marrow blasts with one subsequently proceeding onto successful stem cell transplantation. The other two subjects developed tumor lysis syndrome and unfortunately expired prior to response assessment.” In our review of these trials, we confirmed that the activity demonstrated in this summary corresponds with a “Partial remission” as described in the Response Criteria and that the three subjects who “cleared bone marrow blasts” correspond with “CR” (Complete Response).
 
The Callisto trial was the second trial to study Annamycin in acute leukemia. The first trial was sponsored by Aronex Pharmaceuticals. When Callisto acquired the technology and made changes in manufacturing methods, they had to conduct another Phase 1 dose ranging trial. Unexpectedly, that trial yielded a significantly different result than the Aronex trial.
 
The Aronex trial started at 190 mg/m2, which was expected to be, and in fact was, sub-therapeutic. In accordance with the dose-ranging protocol, dosing was then increased until it reached 350 mg/m2, where DLTs (dose limiting toxicities) forced a de-escalation back to an MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of 280 mg/m2. Although the Callisto trial restarted at the same 190 mg/m2 starting dose used in the Aronex trial, there were immediate instances of DLTs (mucositis), causing the dosing to be reduced instead of escalated. Ultimately, the Callisto trial settled on 150 mg/m2 as the MTD where, during the expansion (Phase 2a) portion of the trial, therapeutic activity was noted.

The production of liposome formulated anthracyclines is very sensitive to subtle changes in production method and starting materials. It is partly for this reason that, more than 10 years later and with entirely new contractors, we had to run yet another Phase 1 dose ranging study. 
 
The Importance of No Cardiotoxicity 
 
We have received an independent expert cardiology assessment confirming the absence of cardiotoxicity in the first 19 patients treated with Annamycin in both our US and European Phase 1 clinical trials. Chemotherapy continues to be a cornerstone of cancer therapy. Despite the progress made with immunotherapy and precision medicine, the first-line treatment for many cancers continues to include chemotherapy. And, in part because of the emphasis placed on alternatives to chemotherapy, we believe that not enough has been done to improve chemotherapeutic agents to make them safer, especially with regard to cardiotoxicity (damage to the heart), and more effective. Anthracyclines are a class of chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA (by creating iron-mediated free oxygen radicals, damaging the DNA and cell membranes, and inhibiting topoisomerase II) of rapidly producing cancer cells. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are usually treated with anthracyclines. In the case of acute leukemia, anthracyclines are typically used in “induction therapy,” where the goal is often to induce sufficient remission of patients’ blood-born tumor cells to allow for a potentially curative bone marrow transplant.
 
Two key factors limit the safety and effectiveness of anthracyclines: cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance. We believe Annamycin may significantly reduce the impact of these two factors. If early human data from the clinical activity thus far is borne out, of which there is no assurance, Annamycin may ultimately provide clinically meaningful benefits over currently approved anthracyclines in treating certain cancers. Preliminary data from very early-stage clinical trials suggest acute leukemia as a potentially opportune indication in which to further study Annamycin.
 
One of the key dose-limiting toxicities associated with currently available anthracyclines (including the anthracycline in the approved drug, Vyxeos) is the propensity to induce life-threatening heart damage (also known as cardiotoxicity). This is a particularly significant risk for pediatric leukemia patients, whose life spans can be severely shortened by the induction therapy intended to cure them of acute leukemia. In the animal model recommended by the FDA as an indicator of human cardiotoxicity, the non-liposomal (free) form of Annamycin has been shown to be significantly less likely than doxorubicin to create heart lesions in mice, and the liposomal formulation (L-Annamycin) has been shown in these same models to have reduced cardiotoxicity to the point where it is unlikely to cause harm to human patients. If this characteristic is shown to be the same in humans, it may allow Annamycin to be used more aggressively to help patients achieve remission. This would be especially valuable in the case of pediatric acute leukemia (both AML and ALL) because of the potential impact of cardiotoxicity on long-term survival. In our current Phase 1/2 trial for Annamycin, we are collecting data to further validate the design intent of Annamycin to have little or no cardiotoxicity. Unless otherwise noted, all of our references to Annamycin refer to the liposomal form (L-Annamycin).
 
In addition, the effectiveness of currently approved anthracyclines is limited by their propensity for succumbing to “multidrug resistance.” This can occur where, as a natural defense mechanism, transmembrane proteins acting as transporters (one type of which is referred to as a “P-glycoprotein pump” or “ABCB1 transporter”) develop on the outer surface of cells to expel perceived threats like anthracyclines. In many instances, the likelihood of cardiotoxicity (and other serious side effects) prevents increasing the dosing of current therapies in order to overcome multidrug resistance. As a result, most patients cannot receive current anthracyclines in doses that are adequate to produce lasting remission and thereby qualify for a bone marrow transplant. A laboratory study has suggested that Annamycin may resist being expelled by P-glycoprotein pumps and similar multidrug resistance transporters, which may mean the drug circumvents multidrug resistance. This characteristic has been shown in pre-clinical testing to allow for higher drug uptake in diseased cells, which we believe could allow for more effective induction therapy with less risk to the patient, especially in relapsed patients.
 
Additionally, preclinical research in animal models at MD Anderson demonstrated that Annamycin is able to significantly improve survival in an aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs in animal models. Coupled with research in animal models demonstrating that Annamycin is capable of accumulating in the lungs at very high levels, this suggests that Annamycin may be well suited to become a treatment for lung-localized tumors.
 
In all instances, it will be important to develop additional clinical data regarding the early indications from preclinical and early clinical data, as discussed below.
 
Annamycin as a Single Agent in AML
 
The prior development history of Annamycin in acute leukemia suggests that a possible accelerated approval pathway exists by positioning Annamycin as a single agent for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. Notwithstanding the recent approval of multiple drugs for this indication, most of these drugs are targeted therapies that are helpful to only a small percentage of the overall AML patient population. A significant unmet need still exists for those patients that are refractory to or relapse from the traditional first-line induction therapy (known as “7+3”) designed to induce remission of AML and, in some cases, prepare patients for a curative bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately, the majority of AML patients do not respond adequately to the current first line therapies. In addition, approximately 40% of AML patients are deemed “unfit” for 7+3 due to the intensity of this chemotherapy. We estimate that a significant portion of those patients are deemed unfit because of the potential for cardiotoxicity inherent in the anthracyclines currently used in 7+3. Given its lack of cardiotoxicity, single agent Annamycin may also provide a viable treatment alternative for such patients.

Annamycin in Combination with Ara-C in AML
 
As a part of our ongoing sponsored research at MD Anderson, animal testing has indicated that the combination of Annamycin with Ara-C provides a synergistic effect that is more effective in AML mouse models than either drug alone. The data was presented at the 62nd Annual Meeting & Exposition of the American Society for Hematology (ASH) under the title: "High Efficacy of Liposomal Annamycin (L-ANN) in Combination with Cytarabine in Syngeneic p53-null AML Mouse Model."
 
This study was conducted in a highly aggressive AML mouse model where median survival is approximately 13 days. For animals treated with the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C, median survival ranged from 56 to 76 days, thus expanding median survival by 585%, with some animals being completely cured. We believe these experiments support initiation of clinical development of the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C in AML patients.
 
Although Annamycin has already shown human activity as a single agent in its two Phase 1 AML clinical trials, including one complete response, and has shown no signs of cardiotoxicity, unlike other anthracyclines, it now appears, based on the observed synergy in vitro and confirmatory in vivo data, that the combination of Annamycin and Ara-C could be more effective in a clinical setting than Annamycin as a single agent. This would be consistent with current practice to use Ara-C in combination with an anthracycline like Annamycin. The current first-line therapy for AML patients is the combination of an anthracycline and Ara-C in a regimen referred to as "7+3" where Ara-C is administered daily for 7 days in parallel with 3 daily doses of an anthracycline. Simply substituting the currently used anthracycline in a similar 7+3 regimen with Annamycin would represent a familiar and well-practiced treatment modality. Beyond that, we believe it would have the added advantages that Annamycin has been shown in published research to be active against tumor cells resistant to doxorubicin and, importantly, has the potential to remove the concern for cardiotoxicity, a significant toxic side effect of currently used anthracyclines.
 
Annamycin as a Single Agent in STS Lung Metastases
 
Moleculin recently announced that Annamycin demonstrates consistently high antitumor activity in vivo in all tested animal models of different types of lung-localized cancers, including sarcoma. These promising findings correlate with surprisingly high uptake of Annamycin to the lungs in animal models. We found in our studies that the Annamycin uptake is over 30-fold higher than that of doxorubicin, the primary first-line chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The limited pulmonary uptake of doxorubicin in animal models may help explain its lack of activity against STS lung metastases in humans. Additionally, our clinical data to date show no cardiotoxicity associated with the use of Annamycin, and the published research demonstrate Annamycin’s ability to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms, both of which are often treatment-limiting effects of anthracyclines (which includes doxorubicin) in this setting. Taken together, these factors suggest that Annamycin could represent an important treatment to help address a significant unmet need in patients with STS lung metastases.
 
We announced in April 2019 that our ongoing sponsored research at MD Anderson demonstrated that Annamycin is able to significantly improve survival in an aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs in animal models. We know that Annamycin was previously shown to be significantly more potent than doxorubicin in both Lewis lung carcinoma in vivo and small cell lung cancer in vitro models. In addition to seeing activity in animal models of triple negative breast cancer metastasized to the lungs, we are also seeing activity in colon cancer metastasized to the lungs. The particular animal models used in our testing are considered to represent a very aggressive forms of cancer. We believe our success in increasing the survival rate in mice with these tumor models in combination with the previously observed high uptake of Annamycin by the lungs is a promising indication that supports additional clinical research in lung and metastatic lung cancers.
 
Furthermore, a poster entitled, "Liposomal annamycin inhibition of lung localized breast cancer," was presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium held in December 2019. The published poster (https://www.moleculin.com/san-antonio-bc-symposium-poster/) shows substantially increased survival in both triple negative breast cancer and colon cancer lung metastases animal models. It should also be noted that treatment with Annamycin resulted in long-term survival of a significant number of animals, even when cancer was reintroduced into the animals post initial treatment, suggesting the development of beneficial immune memory. A reduction in tumor growth was demonstrated and also a reversal of tumor activity resulting in an almost complete reduction of tumor burden.
 
On February 2, 2021, we announced that a preclinical study in animals has confirmed a significant therapeutic benefit of Annamycin against metastatic osteosarcoma. As of day 130 of the study, the survival rate for animals treated with Annamycin was 100%, compared with only 10% for untreated animals. Computerized tomography scans demonstrated that animals treated with Annamycin exhibited suppression of tumor growth and not a single death was observed in the treated animals, whereas observed tumor burden was believed to have contributed to the rapid death of 90% of untreated animals. We believe this data is a promising indication of the possibility of Annamycin’s impact on other cancers metastasized to the lungs. We caution that this is preclinical animal data and we can provide no assurance that we will see similar results in our planned clinical trials.
 
It is estimated that there are approximately 36,000 new cases of STS in the seven major markets (US, EU5 and Japan) each year. Our clinical advisors estimate that approximately half of all STS patients will eventually develop lung metastases from their primary tumor. Although first-line treatments such as surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiation may provide initial therapeutic benefit for approximately one third of those patients, there are no approved or emerging second-line therapies for the remaining patients who relapse or are refractory. Although the lungs tend to be a major site of relapse, we are aware of only 2 active clinical trials specifically targeting STS lung metastases, indicating that Annamycin currently faces limited competition in this area of development.
 
Along with the results in STS lung metastases, our animal models have shown activity in other lung metastases, including osteosarcoma, colorectal and triple negative breast cancer, as well as meaningful concentration levels of Annamycin in the liver, spleen and pancreas. Additionally, when tested in a highly aggressive AML mouse model, Annamycin significantly reduced tumor burden in the spleen, lungs and liver, leading to an increase in survival. Based on this promising preclinical data, we believe the ultimate market opportunity for Annamycin could be much larger than just STS lung metastases.

Clinical Trials for Annamycin

In 2021, we expect Annamycin will be studied for the treatment of AML and STS metastasized to the lungs in a total of three separate clinical trials, underway, or planned, including physician-sponsored trials. Additionally, we believe that data supports a fourth clinical trial to begin with Annamycin in combination with Ara-C for the treatment of AML also in 2021.
 
We filed our IND application for Annamycin for the treatment of AML, with the clinical strategy of increasing the MTD mentioned above, in February 2017, which was allowed in September 2017. The FDA limited dosages to patients to a lifetime maximum anthracycline exposure of 550 mg/m2 which in effect limited the maximum dose in our trial to 120 mg/m2. Patient treatment began in the US in March 2018.
 
In August 2017, we met with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss a CTA (Clinical Trial Authorization) in Europe for the study of Annamycin for the treatment of AML. In December 2017, the Ethics Committee in Poland approved our Phase 1/2 trial of Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. A final approval was required by the Polish National Office which was received in June 2018. This enabled our Phase 1/2 clinical trial there to study Annamycin for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML to begin. The EMA did not impose a lifetime maximum anthracycline exposure limit in this trial.
 
In February 2020, we announced that our open label, single arm US Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 trial had concluded its second cohort and met its primary objective of demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating relapsed or refractory AML. We have received an independent expert cardiology assessment confirming the absence of cardiotoxicity in the first 19 patients treated with Annamycin in both our US and European Phase 1 clinical trials. Annamycin is currently in one Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Europe, and the Phase 1 portion of another Phase 1/2 AML trial in the US has been concluded, subject to final database lock and closure. The FDA requested that we demonstrate that Annamycin could be safely administered to patients up to the lifetime maximum allowable level of anthracycline (LTMAD) established by the FDA and the trial met this primary endpoint. The FDA established the LTMAD because of concerns about cardiotoxicity associated with currently approved anthracyclines when administered above the LTMAD. Of the first 19 patients in our trials, 11 have been treated above the LTMAD (one patient received more than double the LTMAD) and none have shown evidence of any cardiotoxicity. As a result of discussions with the FDA, we will focus on establishing a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in our trial in Europe, and, as requested by the FDA, we will generate additional safety and efficacy data.
 
The trial in Poland is in its fifth cohort, where patients are being treated at 240 mg/m2. Patient 2 in this cohort experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), related to liver function, secondarily related to concomitant medication not being withheld. Although that DLT resolved, in accordance with the trial protocol, the cohort was expanded and has now enrolled a total of five patients. In March 2021, patient 4 in this cohort experienced a similar DLT and, accordingly, no additional patients will be enrolled at this dose level beyond the five patients enrolled to date. The DLT for Patient 4 is being monitored and, per protocol, other patients in this cohort are permitted to continue to receive the full dose of Annamycin, at the discretion of their physicians and with the patients being notified of the reported DLTs. 
 
Moleculin is planning to amend the protocol for this trial to allow exploration of an intermediate dose level between the 210 mg/m2 dose in the fourth cohort and the current 240 mg/m2 dose level, in order to establish the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), which may be the same. While this will establish an MTD for Annamycin in AML and inform the starting dose in our planned trials in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases, we do not believe it will limit the dose escalation in our STS trials. Because of the different indication and differences in dosing regimen, we expect to determine a separate MTD in the Phase 1 portion of the STS trials. Once the MTD in the single agent AML trial is established, we currently plan to begin the expansion Phase 2 portion of this trial with relapsed patients at the RP2D, in order to determine the potential efficacy of Annamycin as a second line, single agent treatment for relapsed AML. Following on our preclinical research, we also intend to begin the Phase 1 portion of an AML trial using Annamycin in combination with Ara-C, a drug commonly used as a single agent and in combination chemotherapy for AML.
 
A preliminary review of the data in the completed cohorts in both trials, which is subject to update, indicates that patients received an average of 3+ and a maximum of 9 prior regimens. Thus far in the completed cohorts of our US and European single agent AML trials, there are 13 relapsed patients who were enrolled after one or more relapses from the prior regimens. Of these, 38% had either a CRi, PR or Bridge to Transplant. We view this as encouraging, because recruitment in the expansion Phase 2 will be limited to patients with no more than a single relapse. This is in contrast to the Phase 1 portion of the trial, where, in order to accelerate recruitment, we included a majority of patients who were primarily refractory or who had two or more relapses from alternate therapy. We believe this is significant because patients who are either refractory or have had two or more relapses are considered to be less likely to respond to therapy and especially to a single agent therapy. As a result and considering that all patients in Phase 2 will be treated at the RP2D, we believe the overall response in the expansion Phase 2 may be better than the overall response in the Phase 1 portion of the trial, although we cannot be certain that actual results will reflect this.

Study Design for AML - 
 
We have been studying Annamycin in both the US and Europe in Phase 1/2 open label, single arm clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Annamycin for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory AML. The US and European trials have essentially the same study design, consisting of a Phase 1 intended to establish a "Recommended Phase 2 Dose" (RP2D), to which the studies may then proceed in the Phase 2 portion. The Phase 1 portion of the studies provide for escalating doses in cohorts of 3 patients each, with each successive cohort receiving the next higher dose level until "dose limiting toxicities" prevent further increases. Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Europe received a dose of 120, 150, 180 and 210 mg/m2, respectively, and the results have permitted moving to Cohort 5 with dosing at 240 mg/m2. Refer to the discussion above for an update on this trial. Cohort 1 in the US started at 100 mg/m2, and the results supported moving to Cohort 2 at 120 mg/m2, which has now been fully recruited, treated, and evaluated. Our US Phase 1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating AML when delivered to patients at or below the lifetime maximum anthracycline dose established by the FDA. The primary safety signal was the absence of cardiotoxicity, a serious and often treatment-limiting issue prevalent with currently approved anthracyclines. The European trial has benefited from a more aggressive dose escalation scheme than was allowed in the US trial and, as a result, has recruited much more rapidly and to much higher dose levels. Accordingly, we have closed the US trial and will rely on the European trial to establish the RP2D.
 
Once we establish an RP2D in the European trial, the intent is to advance to a Phase 2 arm planned to assess the safety and efficacy of Annamycin in 21 additional patients. We may amend the protocol of this study where appropriate to adapt to new information that may affect patient safety and care. The data reported is preliminary as collected by independent CRO site monitors per standard practice and is subject to subsequent quality assurance review.
 
We have been and intend to continue reporting top-line results by cohort in our clinical trials, with each announcement also including an update on any other related trials. Top-line results will include reporting of any drug-related adverse events (AEs) and assessment of cardiotoxicity, including ECHO (echocardiogram) or MUGA (MUGA stands for multiple-gated acquisition and is also known as radionuclide ventriculography (RVG, RNV) or radionuclide angiography (RNA); it is a type of nuclear imaging test intended to show how well the heart is pumping) scans measuring change in ejection fraction and measuring blood troponin level, which is considered a biomarker for potential long-term cardiovascular impairment. Top-line results will also include the number of partial responses (PRs), complete responses (CRs) and patients deemed capable of progressing to a potentially curative bone marrow transplant, which we term "bridge to transplant" (BTs), each of which is essentially a function of the magnitude of reduction in a patient's bone marrow blasts. For purposes of these clinical trials, a CR means that the patient's bone marrow blasts reduced to 5% or less (with CRi meaning a CR where there was incomplete recovery of white blood cell and/or platelet counts), a PR means the patient's bone marrow blasts reduced by 50% and resulted in a blast count of 25% or less, and a BT means patients are deemed capable of progressing to a potentially curative bone marrow transplant.

Safety of Annamycin in AML Patients - 
 
Our US Phase 1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the safety of Annamycin in treating AML when delivered to patients at or below the lifetime maximum anthracycline dose established by the FDA. The primary safety signal was the absence of cardiotoxicity, a serious and often treatment-limiting issue prevalent with currently approved anthracyclines. As discussed above, this was determined by echocardiograms, as well as cardiac health biomarkers, principally blood troponin levels, which are considered an indicator of potential long-term heart damage. The data showed no cardiotoxicity in all of the patients evaluated in the US Phase 1 trial.
 
Additionally, there were no unexpected serious adverse events and no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at any dose tested until the 240 mg/m2 cohort in Poland. The DLTs in that cohort are discussed above. To date, an independent expert assessment of the absence of cardiotoxicity in the first 19 patients treated with Annamycin in both our US and European Phase 1 clinical trials in which an independent expert concluded that he "does not see evidence of cardiotoxicity.”
 
Compared to previous studies of other anthracyclines, we believe this is an important event. For example, a recent review published in Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5346598/) reported that 65% of patients who received the equivalent of 550 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (a current standard of care anthracycline) exhibited sub-clinical cardiotoxicity, defined as a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction >10% points to a value <50%. In the 5 patients mentioned above who were treated in our European trial above 550 mg/m2, no evidence of cardiotoxicity was detected. The same published review also suggested that a better long-term indicator of cardiotoxicity may be the measurement of an increase in a biomarker called troponin. When measured as an early biomarker of cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity, troponin rise occurs consistently in 21% - 40% of patients after treatment with current standard of care anthracycline chemotherapy and, per the published review, such an increase in troponin is associated with an increased risk of heart disease later in life. Overall, some form of cardiotoxicity, short-term or long-term, occurs in 65% of such patients. Of the 19 patients treated thus far in both of our Annamycin clinical trials and where safety has been assessed, none has shown an increase in troponin levels, again supporting the absence of cardiotoxicity. As previously noted, although these data are, in our view, promising, there remains significant additional clinical investigation to be done, and there can be no guarantee of the future results. 
 
Preliminary Evidence of Potential Effectiveness in AML - 
 
Although the primary objective of the US Phase 1 trial was to evaluate safety, the study also gathered data to support a preliminary assessment of Annamycin's potential efficacy. Among other things, the study recorded complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and event-free survival. Based on these criteria, efficacy was seen in 2 or 30% of the US patients, even though the drug was dosed at what we considered to be sub-therapeutic levels. The evidence of efficacy consisted of 1 patient who achieved a "morphologically leukemia-free state," which the protocol defined as a CR with incomplete recovery of platelets or neutrophils (CRi), and another patient who had a substantial remission of leukemia cutis (a somewhat rare leukemia symptom), improving from diffuse to 3 small lesions.
 
We believe to see this kind of activity this early is encouraging, especially since Phase 1 trials are primarily designed to demonstrate safety, not efficacy, and the dosing was therefore at a level we expected to be sub-therapeutic, based on previous data. We are also encouraged because Annamycin is being studied as a single agent, not in combination with any other drugs. We believe this is potentially significant, because we believe the vast majority of relapsed or refractory AML patients do not respond to single agents. Although this is very early data from a small sample size, we are especially encouraged because the dosing was well below our anticipated recommended Phase 2 dose. We believe that, if the level of activity experienced in the US trial can be demonstrated in a larger patient population, we may be well-positioned to seek accelerated approval from the FDA. FDA has granted Fast Track designation, which recognizes that Annamycin shows the potential to address unmet medical needs, which can include providing efficacy comparable to available therapies while avoiding toxicity associated with the existing treatment.

Between the US and European studies, 15 AML patients have been evaluated after receiving Annamycin at or above 120 mg/m2 in closed cohorts (below 240 mg/m2). When they entered the study, 10 of the 15 patients were considered relapsed and 5 were considered refractory. Although reduction in bone and/or circulating blasts has been seen in most relapsed and refractory AML patients, each of the 5 patients where efficacy endpoints were met was a relapsed patient. In the 15 patients mentioned, efficacy signals have been demonstrated to date in 50% of the relapsed and 33% of the refractory patients. The efficacy-related data for those patients (which includes the 2 US patients mentioned above) is as follows:
 

• | One patient had a CRi, which the protocol defined as a complete response with incomplete recovery of white blood cells and/or platelets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Two patients had PRs (partial responses, meaning that bone marrow blasts were reduced 50% and to below 25%);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One patient had a substantial remission (from diffuse to a few lesions) of their somewhat rare leukemic symptom known as leukemia cutis; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One patient was bridged to bone marrow transplant (BT) based on a sufficient reduction in bone marrow blasts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We refer to Annamycin as a "next generation anthracycline," because it is designed, and thus far has shown clinically, to provide enhanced therapeutic benefits when compared with traditional anthracyclines (like doxorubicin) while reducing the potential for cardiotoxicity, or damage to the heart. This design intent has previously been validated with preclinical toxicology studies in animal models (as required by FDA) demonstrating Annamycin has little to no cardiotoxicity, unlike what is seen with doxorubicin. Of the 19 patients treated and fully evaluated thus far in both trials, including those treated below 120 mg/m2, none has shown any evidence of cardiotoxicity. This includes 10 patients in Europe who were treated at levels above the US maximum allowable lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose level (550 mg/m2), a limitation not imposed on our trial in Europe. If this continues to be confirmed in further studies, this lack of toxicity could be an important differentiator between Annamycin and the currently approved anthracyclines, for which cardiotoxicity is a well-known treatment limitation.
 
Plans for a Phase 2 Trial for AML - 
 
Upon conclusion of our European AML clinical trial, we intend to discuss with the FDA and EMA our plans to conduct a single arm Phase 2 trial that would serve as the basis for accelerated approval of Annamycin to treat AML. This will follow the establishment of a RP2D in our ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in Europe. The FDA has already granted Annamycin Fast Track status and ODD for AML. The benefits of Fast Track include FDA actions to expedite development and review, including "rolling review," where the agency reviews portions of a marketing application before the complete application is submitted.
 
Most recently, the US Phase 1 study met its primary objective of demonstrating the safety of Annamycin at a dose that was cumulatively at or below the lifetime maximum anthracycline dose established by the FDA. Those results are consistent with results achieved with the parallel Phase 1/2 study being conducted in Europe, which has demonstrated the safety of escalating doses of Annamycin in AML patients, including doses that significantly exceed the maximum lifetime dose of anthracyclines imposed in the US. In both trials, the primary endpoints are aimed at demonstrating the product's safety, primarily the lack of cardiovascular risk, as measured by echocardiograms and cardiac health biomarkers, principally blood troponin levels, among other things. Based on these results, we will continue to focus our efforts on the European trial to establish an RP2D. Once that is complete, we intend to enter discussions with the FDA and EMA about conducting a single arm Phase 2 study that would be the pivotal trial supporting US and European approval of Annamycin for relapsed or refractory AML, and, if approved, with an additional confirmatory post-approval Phase 3 study also possibly being required. We can provide no assurance that the FDA or their EU or other equivalent will permit such reliance and we may be required to conduct additional trials.
 
Plans for a Phase 1/2 Trial of AnnAraC in AML
 
Based on the preclinical data discussed above, we are preparing to start a new clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the combination of Annamycin with Ara-C, a combination we are calling “AnnAraC.” We expect this clinical trial to begin sometime in the second half of 2021.
 
We intend for our planned study of AnnAraC in AML to have a similar trial design to the current Phase 1/2 study of Annamycin as a single agent in AML. We believe safety data from our current single agent trial will enable us to begin the combination trial at a higher starting dose of Annamycin in the Phase 1 portion but that will be an issue for the applicable regulatory agency when we approach them on an IND or CTA. We believe that the initial site for a combination trial will most likely be in Europe.
 
Plans for a Phase 1b/2 Trial of Annamycin in STS Lung Metastases
 
We have been moving quickly to begin a clinical trial in the US to study Annamycin for STS lung metastases, and in light of the importance of producing human clinical data to facilitate outlicensing opportunities, we included this upcoming trial as part of our internally funded clinical development program. In December 2020, we announced that the FDA allowed our IND application to study Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases to go into effect. This allows us to begin a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the US for patients with soft tissue sarcoma that has metastasized to the lungs after first-line therapy for their disease.
 
We are also collaborating with WPD and physicians in Poland who have shown a high level of interest in testing Annamycin in STS lung metastases and are currently pursuing a physician-sponsored clinical trial in Europe. WPD recently announced their facilitation of a grant equivalent to $1.5 million USD to the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute to fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of Annamycin for the treatment of STS lung metastases. The grant-funded clinical trial will be led by Prof. Piotr Rutkowski, MD, PhD, Head of Department of Soft Tissue/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology in Warsaw, Poland, and it will be operated independently of our study in the US.
 
It is our goal to have to have our US clinical trial begin by mid-2021, with the possibility of the European-funded clinical trial to begin later in 2021.

The WP1066 Portfolio
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1066 Portfolio and its close analogs, molecules targeting the modulation of key oncogenic transcription factors. In 2019, the FDA granted ODD for WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma, which means the agency believes we have established a medically plausible basis for using the drug to treat glioblastoma.
 
Our WP1066 Portfolio (including lead drug candidates WP1066 and WP1220) we believe, represents a novel class of agents capable of hitting multiple targets, including the activated form of a key oncogenic transcription factor, STAT3. A substantial body of published research has identified STAT3 as a master regulator of a wide range of tumors and has linked the activated form, p-STAT3, with the survival and progression of these tumors. For this reason, it is believed that targeted inhibition of p-STAT3 may be an effective way to reduce or eliminate the progression of these diseases. During 2020, we have been working on developing an appropriate IV formulation for the portfolio of WP1066. As a result of these studies, we believe that the lead molecule WP1066 may be our best candidate for intravenous administration and studies of an IV formulation candidate are currently underway. Additionally, we determined that the stability of WP1732, another molecule in the WP1066 Portfolio was less than satisfactory and, as such, in March 2021 we terminated our license for WP1732 with MDA.
 
The high level of anticancer activity demonstrated in multiple tumors in animal models by WP1066 is potentially related to its ability to also inhibit such important key oncogenic transcription factors such as c-Myc and HIF-1α. In addition to direct anticancer effects not related to the function of the immune system, our lead drug candidate WP1066 has also been shown to boost immune response in animals, in part by inhibiting activity of Regulatory T cells (TRegs), which are coopted by tumors to evade the immune system. We believe the dual effect of (1) directly inhibiting tumor growth and inducing tumor cell death and (2) separately boosting and directing the natural immune response to tumors is therapeutically promising. If additional preclinical and clinical data validate these two avenues of apparent activity, this class of drugs may be well-suited to treat a wide range of tumors, both as single agents and as critical elements of successful combination therapies targeting even some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers.
 
The recent oncology drug landscape has been dominated by immunotherapy, specifically including checkpoint inhibitors. In the last 5 years, checkpoint inhibitors (such as Opdivo and Keytruda) have reached over $10 billion in annual revenues. To summarize checkpoint blockade therapy, the T-Cells within an individual’s own immune systems should be capable of identifying tumor cells and destroying them before they destroy the individual. Unfortunately, tumors develop the ability to prevent this natural immune response by regulating the expression of certain receptors referred to as “immune checkpoints” that then bind to T-Cells and prevent them from attacking the tumor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that block these receptor mechanisms and allow the T-Cells to act normally and attack the tumor.
 
In certain types of tumors, like melanoma, checkpoint inhibitors work well, and the results can be impressive, creating durable suppression of tumors where no other therapy had succeeded. However, despite the outstanding results in select patients, checkpoint inhibitors benefit only a limited number of patients in certain cancers, and they are essentially not effective in what are called “non-responsive” tumors like glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer, among others. As a result, companies are now focusing heavily on combination therapies, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, as well as other agents. We believe there is a need for new chemotherapeutic agents that, by their specific mechanism of action, would produce potent combination effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and that additionally can boost immune system response on their own. In this regard, there is early preclinical evidence that WP1066, as a single agent, may have the ability to reverse immune tolerance in brain tumor patients (Cancer Res, 67(20), 9630, 2007), and preliminary data in animal models that suggests WP1066 may have a potential for combination use with checkpoint inhibitors. We intend to pursue additional study to build on this preclinical evidence and preliminary animal model data.
 
Recently published research papers have presented several findings that may point to new opportunities for our WP1066 class of drugs. One such article suggested that our STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 abrogated PD-L1/2 expression in cancer cells and may be a useful agent in addition to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in cancer patients (J Clin Exp Hematop, 57(1), 21-25, 2017). Other published results show that CTLA4-induced immune suppression occurs primarily via an intrinsic STAT3 pathway, suggesting that, through its inhibition of activated STAT3, WP1066 might work well in combination with this checkpoint inhibitor (Cancer Res, 77(18), 5118–28, 2017).
 
A separate paper presents selected key transcription factors as being responsible for the upregulation of an often-targeted checkpoint actor in tumors known as PD-L1. Some of the most important transcription factors identified were HIF-1α, c-Myc and STAT3, the very targets for which WP1066 was designed (Front Pharmacol, 2018 May 22, 9:536, doi: 10.3389/ fphar.2018.00536, eCollection 2018). In summary, although much of the data is preclinical and all of it is preliminary, we are optimistic that administration of WP1066 could lead to improved treatment results in many patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

WP1066

WP1066 is our flagship Immune/Transcription Modulator. It has been the subject of over 50 peer-reviewed articles and its activity against p-STAT3 has now been validated in independent labs around the globe. This discovery was inspired by a naturally occurring compound (caffeic acid) in propolis (from honeybees). Caffeic acid has shown a natural ability to inhibit p-STAT3, which is considered a master regulator of inflammatory processes that support tumor survival and proliferation.
 
WP1066 has exhibited an ability to inhibit other key oncogenic transcription factors, including c-Myc and HIF-1α. A critical characteristic of WP1066 and its analogs is the ability to inhibit p-STAT3 independently of upstream cell signaling. We believe this overcomes the limitations of many other drugs designed to inhibit STAT3 activity by blocking upstream receptors.
 
Another important attribute of WP1066 (unlike some of our other Immune/Transcription Modulators) is its apparent ability in pre-clinical testing to cross the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a good candidate for potentially treating brain tumors and other malignancies of the central nervous system. WP1066 has shown significant anti-tumor activity and increased survival in a wide range of tumor cell lines and animal models.
 
As with other analogs in this portfolio, WP1066 also has a demonstrated in animal models the ability to boost a natural immune response to tumor activity. In animal models, WP1066 has been shown to upregulate STAT1, a transcription factor associated with immune stimulation. At the same time, it has been shown to reduce levels of Regulatory T-Cells, or TRegs, which are coopted by tumors to protect themselves from attack by the patient’s natural immune system. This forms a unique dual action (directly attacking the transcription factors that support tumor development and separately boosting the natural immune response to tumors) that may make WP1066 uniquely suited to treat a wide range of tumors and may also serve as an important element in combination therapies targeting some of the most difficult cancers.
 
In vitro testing has shown a high level of activity for WP1066 against a wide range of solid tumors, and in vivo testing has shown significant activity against head and neck, pancreatic, stomach, and renal cancers, as well as metastatic melanoma and glioblastoma, among others. In vivo testing in mouse tumor models indicates that WP1066 inhibits tumor growth, blocks angiogenesis (a process that leads to the formation of blood vasculature needed for tumor growth) and increases survival.
 
Recently, our own sponsored research and published findings from independent researchers point to the possibility that administration of WP1066 could lead to improved treatment results in many patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Additionally, in April 2019 we announced that preclinical data supporting activity of our STAT3-inhibiting Immune/Transcription Modulators was presented by Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our co-founder and chair of our Scientific Advisory Board, at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Atlanta, GA. The abstract (AACR Abstract: https://www.moleculin.com/inhibition-of-stat3-in-pancreatic-ductal-adenocarcinoma-and-immunotherapeutic-implications/ ) and presentation included data resulting from preclinical evaluation in pancreatic cancer models of the STAT3 inhibitor WP1066. In vitro efficacy of this inhibitor was assessed using proliferation and apoptosis induction assays in a panel of patient-derived and commercially available Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. WP1066 was shown to be potent and to induce apoptosis and inhibit p-STAT3 and its nuclear localization in all tested PDAC cell lines. Observed IC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 2 μM. Importantly, WP1066 shows in-vivo efficacy in preliminary experiments when tested alone or in combination with T cell immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Clinical Activity WP1066 -
 
Two trials are underway with WP1066. The first trial is a physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial of WP1066 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma and brain metastasis from melanoma which the FDA allowed to proceed in December 2017. In July 2018, this trial opened for recruitment in the US. This dose-escalation Phase 1 brain tumor clinical trial via a physician-sponsored IND with MD Anderson Cancer Center has generated pharmacokinetic data for oral dosed WP1066. That data demonstrated sufficient bioavailability of our drug via oral administration to show the presence of WP1066 in blood plasma on a dose-dependent basis. Investigators at MD Anderson have begun the fourth and final cohort in the dose escalation phase.
 
    14 

  

The Phase 1 trial at MD Anderson with WP1066 drug is being supported by $2 million in private grant funding which is in addition to two Specialized Programs of Research Excellence or (SPORE) peer reviewed grants awarded by the National Cancer Institute. We believe the rigorous peer-review process applied to SPORE grant applications represents an important additional measure of independent assessment and validation of the research connected with our approach to using WP1066/STAT3 for the treatment of cancer. The grants described here do not flow through our financial statements, but instead are applied to the cost of preclinical and clinical activities at and conducted by MD Anderson.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, we were notified that the physician sponsoring this trial is leaving MDA. Although we cannot be assured that this trial will continue at MDA after her departure, several additional institutions have expressed an interest in sponsoring similar research on WP1066 in brain tumors, so to help ensure the potential continuation of this important research, regardless of the sponsoring institution, we have requested the IND for this trial to be transferred into our name with the FDA, although there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing such transfer. While we are making arrangements to continue this research in additional physician-sponsored trials, we expect that continued research on WP1066 in adult GBM will be delayed.
 
At the 2009 annual meeting of the Society for Neuro Oncology (SNO), Emory University researchers reported encouraging activity in animals with their in vitro pediatric brain tumor models using WP1066. Based on this data, they filed and received clearance to proceed with an IND for a trial to treat children with recurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors with WP1066. This trial is being conducted at the Aflac Cancer & Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. This trial has now successfully completed treatment of three patients in the first cohort and two patients in the second cohort, with the third and last patient in the second cohort having begun treatment at the dose level of 6mg/kg. In that trial, one of the patients with DIPG showed an apparent response to the treatment with both clinical improvement and radiologic reduction of tumor size. We caution that this is preliminary data and no conclusions should be drawn from this single event.
 
In July 2020 we announced that a peer-reviewed article published in Clinical Cancer Research (Clin Cancer Res June 30 2020 DOI:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092) reported findings that WP1066, used in combination with traditional whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) resulted in long-term survivors and enhanced median survival time relative to monotherapy in mice with implanted human brain tumors. The paper can be accessed at: https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2020/06/30/1078-0432.CCR-19-4092.full-text.pdf
 
The study was performed by lead author Martina Ott, Ph.D., Instructor of Neurosurgery, senior author Amy Heimberger, M.D., professor of Neurosurgery, and a team of researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Dr. Heimberger was also the Principal Investigator of the current physician-sponsored clinical trial of WP1066 for brain tumors. In the current study, C57BL/6 mice underwent intracerebral implantation of GL261 glioma cells, WBRT, and treatment with WP1066, a blood-brain barrier penetrant inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway, or the two in combination. The role of the immune system was evaluated using tumor rechallenge strategies, immune incompetent backgrounds, immunofluorescence, immune phenotyping of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (via flow cytometry), and nanostring gene expression analysis of 770 immune-related genes from immune cells, including those directly isolated from the tumor microenvironment.
 
The combination of WP1066 and WBRT resulted in long-term survivors and enhanced median survival time relative to monotherapy in the GL261 glioma model (combination vs. control p<0.0001). Immunological memory appeared to be induced, because mice were protected during subsequent tumor rechallenge. The therapeutic effect of the combination was completely lost in immune incompetent animals. Nanostring analysis and immunofluorescence revealed immunological reprogramming in the brain tumor microenvironment specifically affecting dendritic-cell antigen presentation and T cell effector functions. The study indicates that the combination of STAT3 inhibition and WBRT enhances the therapeutic effect against gliomas in the CNS by inducing dendritic-cell and T cell interactions in the brain tumor, which seems to be a requirement for a fully functional immune response
 
This study is consistent with preliminary data we announced last year. Importantly, the study indicated the potential that the combination of STAT3 inhibition with whole brain radiotherapy had the capacity to enhance the therapeutic effect against established tumors as well as developing immune memory that appears to prevent recurrence.
 
With this preclinical data, we believe that another physician-sponsored Phase 1 trial should be considered for the treatment of GBM with WP1066 in combination with radiation, although no assurances can be given that such trial will begin.

WP1220 
 
An analog of WP1066, referred to as WP1220, was previously the subject of an IND (WP1220 was referred to as “MOL4239” for purposes of this IND) related to use of the molecule in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Clinical trials were commenced on WP1220 in the US but were terminated early due to limited efficacy in the topical treatment of psoriatic plaques. Notwithstanding its limitations in treating psoriasis, our pre-clinical research in multiple cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines has suggested that WP1220 may be effective in inhibiting CTCL. Based on this data, we are collaborating with two Polish drug development companies. One is Dermin, which has previously received Polish government grant money to develop WP1220 in Poland for the topical treatment of early stage CTCL patients, and the other is WPD Pharmaceuticals, which is applying for Polish government grant money. CTCL is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer for which there are limited treatment options. 
 
Clinical Activity WP1220 – 
 
In August 2019, we completed full enrollment in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in Poland to study WP1220 for the treatment of CTCL. Polish authorities approved our CTA for this use in January 2019, and the trial began enrolling patients in March 2019. In February 2020, we announced the final data from our CTCL clinical trial of WP1220, which was published and presented by Dr. M. Sokolowska-Wojdylo in conjunction with the 4th Annual World Congress of Cutaneous Lymphomas in Barcelona, Spain on February 13, 2020. The final results supported the safety of topical WP1220 and demonstrated an improvement in the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score.
 
Mycosis Fungoides or MF, the most common variant of CTCL, is a disease with symptomatic, disfiguring skin lesions. STAT3, an oncogenic transcription factor, has been identified as a critical regulator of MF, whereby the activation of STAT3 through phosphorylation (p-STAT3) has been linked to tumor proliferation and suppression of immune responses. Preclinical testing demonstrated that WP1220, a synthetic compound, potently inhibits the activity of p-STAT3 and the growth of CTCL cell lines. This Phase 1 study was designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of WP1220 after topical treatment of CTCL.
 
Of 5 subjects enrolled, 11 lesions were assessed according to the CAILS scoring system. The only related adverse event (AE) was mild contact dermatitis in one subject that the Investigator deemed was not related to the drug. 4 of the 5 subjects improved in CAILS scores on index lesions, with one exhibiting stable disease, with a median reduction of 56% (range 25-94%). Improvement was noted within 7 days of treatment initiation and maintained 1 month after discontinuation. Of the 11 lesions, 45% exhibited a CR or a 50% or more reduction in CAILS and 55% exhibited stable disease with 100% showing a clinical benefit. Independent dermatologic review based on photographic documentation was conducted and corroborated these findings.
 
    16 

  

Although this was a small proof-of-concept clinical trial, WP1220, topically applied, had no safety issues and appeared to be effective in MF. We believe this is the first demonstration in humans suggesting that inhibition of p-STAT3 with topical therapy has efficacy in CTCL. As a result of this, we are actively seeking third-party collaborations to begin a Phase 2a/2b trial with approximately 60 patients. If a suitable collaborator is not identified, we will consider internally funding a Phase 2a clinical trial to gather further human efficacy data.
 
IV Formulation for the WP1066 Portfolio 
 
The topical application WP1220 does not appear to result in systemic exposure to the drug, which is desirable in case of a topical drug targeting a dermatologic condition, however, WP1066 is currently administered orally with the intent of systemic uptake. Although preliminary data from physician-sponsored brain tumor trials indicates that the oral administration of WP1066 does result in detectable levels of WP1066 in plasma, we believe our opportunity for successful development of a p-STAT3 inhibitor would be expanded if we were able to develop a compound capable of intravenous (IV) administration. In 2020, we began developing IV formulation methods for WP1066 that might address its lack of solubility. As a backup, however, we also invested in research to identify molecular analogs that may be more soluble and, therefore, easier to develop for IV administration. In February 2018, we announced that, pursuant to our continued collaboration with MD Anderson we had developed and licensed WP1732, a new molecule in the WP1066 portfolio, that was soluble in water. After continuing research on WP1732, we have more recently identified challenges with the stability of the compound that could limit its development as a drug. In light of these challenges, we terminated the license with MD Anderson related to WP1732. Although we intend to continue our work toward a viable IV formulation of WP1066, there can be no assurance that this effort will be successful.
 
The WP1122 Portfolio
 
We have a license agreement with MD Anderson pursuant to which we have been granted a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license for the patent and technology rights related to our WP1122 Portfolio and similar molecules focused on inhibitors of glycolysis and glycosylation. These new compounds are designed to exploit the potential uses of inhibitors of glycolysis such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which we believe may provide an opportunity to cut off the fuel supply of tumors by taking advantage of their high level of dependence on glucose in comparison to healthy cells. A key drawback to 2-DG is its lack of drug-like properties, including a short circulation time and poor tissue/organ distribution characteristics. Our lead Metabolism/Glycosylation Inhibitor, WP1122, is a prodrug of 2-DG that appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by increasing its circulation time and improving tissue/organ distribution. New research also points to the potential for 2-DG to be capable of enhancing the usefulness of checkpoint inhibitors. Considering that we believe 2-DG lacks sufficient drug-like properties to be practical in a clinical setting, we believe WP1122 has the opportunity to become an important drug to potentiate existing therapies.
 
We believe this technology has the potential to target a wide variety of solid tumors, which eventually become resistant to all treatments, and thereby provide a large and important opportunity for novel drugs. Notwithstanding this potential, we are currently focused on the use of WP1122 and related analogs for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies and especially glioblastoma multiforme. Although less prevalent than some larger categories of solid tumors, cancers of the central nervous system are particularly aggressive and resistant to treatment. The prognosis for such patients can be particularly grim and the treatment options available to their physicians are among the most limited of any cancer. The American Cancer Society has estimated 24,530 new cases of brain and other nervous system cancers will occur in the United States in 2021, resulting in 18,600 deaths. Despite the severity and poor prognosis of these tumors, there are few FDA-approved drugs on the market. 
 
Additionally, based on independent preclinical data, we believe that this technology has the potential to impact hard to treat viruses that also rely heavily on glycolysis and glycosylation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated development of the WP1122 portfolio with a combined effort of internally and externally funded preclinical work on WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19. We recently announced collaborations with third parties to assist us in developing potential treatments for certain viral diseases, including, potentially, COVID-19. During 2020, we announced that in vitro testing corroborated the antiviral potential of WP1122, including for the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Subsequently, we had written discussions with the FDA regarding the clinical development of WP1122 for the treatment of COVID-19. Based on guidance from the FDA, we believe that we need to demonstrate efficacy in a COVID-19 animal model in order to proceed with an IND for COVID-19 clinical trials in the US. Therefore, the timing of any such clinical trial activity in the US is subject to the limited access we have to validated in vivo efficacy testing. For this reason, we are also evaluating opportunities to pursue COVID-19 clinical development outside the US. The IND-enabling preclinical work already completed for WP1122 is mostly similar to the preclinical work we originally planned as part of developing WP1122 for cancer indications.
 
The timing of an IND in the US or an equivalent in certain other countries is mainly dependent on gaining access to validated in vivo testing that is currently in very high demand and therefore limited availability. There are very few validated in vivo testing models for COVID-19 and the wait time for such testing is extremely long. We are focusing our efforts on jurisdictions that may not require testing in a COVID-19 animal model prior to initiating clinical trials. As an example, the CDSCO (the Indian equivalent of the FDA) recently approved human clinical trials for 2-DG (the active moiety of WP1122) in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, according to information published by the CDSCO, the resulting Phase 2 trial in 40 COVID-19 patients demonstrated efficacy of 2-DG. Given that WP1122 is prodrug of 2-DG designed to improve its circulation time and tissue/organ uptake, we consider this human data regarding 2-DG to be potentially more relevant to the potential for WP1122 to be useful in treating COVID-19 than any available animal testing model. 
 
Accordingly, we believe the preclinical work under way for WP1122 will support an IND application or its foreign equivalent for either cancer-related or virus-related clinical trials (or both) in the first half of 2021. Regardless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to move forward in a timely manner with research on using WP1122 to treat COVID-19, or that WP1122 will be effective in COVID-19 patients.
 
Additionally, we will rely on external collaborations for testing other molecules in the WP1122 portfolio against other hard to treat viruses such as HIV, Dengue fever, and Zika.
 
Overview of The Market for Our Oncology Drugs
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States behind heart disease. In 2019, an estimated 16.9 million people in the United States were living with a past or current diagnosis of cancer, and, the American Cancer Society further estimates that in 2021, nearly 1.9 million new cases will be diagnosed and over 600,000 Americans will die from cancer. Importantly, these estimates are based on reported cancer incidence and mortality through 2017 and 2018, respectively, and do not account for the unknown impact of COVID-19 on cancer diagnoses and deaths.

The Orphan Drug Act and other legislative initiatives, such as “Rare Pediatric Disease” designation, provide incentives, including market exclusivity and accelerated approval pathways, for companies that pursue the development of treatments for rare diseases and serious diseases for which there are few or no acceptable available treatment alternatives. Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of companies have begun using these designations to obtain new drug approvals for drugs where patent coverage has expired and/or where accelerated approval appears possible. An IMS Health report estimated that, in 2013, the sale of drugs with full or partial Orphan Drug exclusivity represented approximately $29 billion in revenue. We have obtained and continue to consider obtaining Orphan Drug exclusivity and have pursued and continue to consider pursuing accelerated approval to be important parts of our development strategy for our drug candidates. Notwithstanding these potential opportunities, we can provide no assurance that our drugs will receive Orphan Drug designation (other than Annamycin and WP1066, both of which have received such designation) or, if approved, exclusivity or any other special designation that could, among other things, provide for accelerated approval.
 
Market for Annamycin 
 
Digestive, reproductive, breast and respiratory cancers comprise most of expected cancer diagnoses in 2021, while cancers like leukemia and brain tumors are considered “rare diseases.” Leukemia in particular, can be divided into acute, chronic and other, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprising 25,930 of the estimated 61,090 new cases expected in the United States in 2021. The National Cancer Institute estimates that cancer-related direct medical costs in the US were $183 billion in 2015 and are projected to increase to $246 billion by 2030, a 34% increase based only on population growth and aging. However, the projection is likely an underestimate because of the growing cost of prescription medicines, with the list price for many now more than $100,000 annually.
 
Our lead drug candidate, Annamycin, is in a class of drugs referred to as anthracyclines, which are chemotherapy drugs designed to destroy the DNA of targeted cancer cells. The approved anthracyclines most commonly used are daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, prior to the expansion of their generic equivalents, annual revenues generated from anthracyclines have been estimated in the range of $770 million. Acute leukemia is one of a number of cancers that are treated with anthracyclines. One industry report estimates that annual drug revenues generated from the demand for AML-related therapies in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain were in the range of $153 million in 2016, and it is estimated that this number is increasing with the increase in approved AML treatments – estimated to rise to $1.6 billion by 2025. Of this worldwide amount, The US market is estimated to comprise the largest share.
 
Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow, suppressing the production of normal blood cells. Currently, the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, also known as a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level. This usually begins with a therapy referred to as “7+3,” which consists of combining seven injections of Cytarbine with 3 infusions of an anthracycline to induce remission (a complete response, or “CR”). This therapy had not improved since it was first used in the 1970s and we estimate that this induction therapy had a success rate of about 20% to 25%. A revision to this therapy was approved in the form of a drug called Vyxeos, which involves combining Cytarabine and an anthracycline (daunorubicin) into a single liposomal injection given 3 times. This improvement appears to have increased the level of CRs to 34% and the overall survival by 3.5 months. Unfortunately, the current clinically approved anthracyclines (including Vyxeos) are cardiotoxic (i.e., can damage the heart), which can limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells often present de novo or develop resistance to the first line anthracycline, through what is called “multidrug resistance,” enabling the tumor cells to purge themselves of the available anthracyclines. Consequently, in the majority of these patients there remains no effective therapy for inducing remission sufficient to enable a potentially curative bone marrow transplant and unfortunately most patients will succumb quickly to their leukemia. If a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to have “relapsed.” If a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to be “refractory” (resistant to therapy). Together, this group of relapsed and refractory AML patients constitutes our primary focus for treatment with Annamycin and our intent is to pursue FDA approval for Annamycin as a second-line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients.
 
We believe that pursuing approval as a second line induction therapy for adult relapsed or refractory AML patients is the shortest path to regulatory approval, but we also believe that one of the most important potential uses of Annamycin is in the treatment of children with either AML or ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is more common in children). Accordingly, we also intend to pursue approval for pediatric use in these conditions when practicable.
 
Soft tissue sarcoma is a broad term for cancers that start in soft tissues (muscle, tendons, fat, lymph and blood vessels, and nerves). These cancers can develop anywhere in the body but are found mostly in the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen. A research paper by a recognized source of information in the industry provided market estimates to us in late 2020 and the following estimates are based on that paper.
 
    18 

  

The lungs are the most frequent site of metastasis from soft-tissue sarcomas. From several studies, it has been estimated that around 50-60% of the STS cases develop lung metastases. Effective systemic therapies for metastatic STS are currently limited; when possible, surgical removal of the lung metastases (known as pulmonary metastasectomy, PM) is the preferred treatment. Metastasectomy and/or chemotherapy are the most common treatments offered to patients with metastatic sarcoma. Pulmonary metastasectomy, either video-assisted or through a formal thoracotomy, has been shown to increase overall survival in select populations of both osseous and soft tissue sarcoma patients. The market is expected to grow as a result of factors like an increase in the patient pool.
 
The market size of STS with lung metastases in the seven major markets is expected to rise from $177 million in 2017 to reach $198 million by 2030. The total incident population of STS with lung metastases in the seven major markets is anticipated to rise from 7,871 in 2017 to 8,698 by 2030. According to the estimates, the highest market size of STS with lung metastases was estimated in the United States, followed by Germany. The market of STS with lung metastases is categorized into first-line and second-line+ therapies. The therapies in the first line of treatment involve surgery, off-label treatment, and stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT). It has been estimated that around 60-65% of patients taking the first-line treatment due to relapse of the disease progress on to second-line treatment. Since there are no approved or emerging therapies for treatment of relapsed/refractory patients, first-line therapies are often used again in second-line management. Given this backdrop, we believe the best initial pathway for Annamycin is to pursue the second-line treatment of STS lung metastasis.
 
Market for Our WP1066 Portfolio
 
Our two other active development projects, WP1066 and WP1122, have potential applications (among others) in the treatment of brain tumors, another rare disease for which there are few available treatments. The leading brain tumor drug is temozolomide, a drug introduced under the brand name Temodar. In 2012, one industry source reported annual revenues of approximately $882 million for Temodar before the expiration of its patent protection, at which point generic versions of the drug began to enter the market and reduce prices.
 
WP1066 is our most published asset (over 50 peer reviewed articles), and we believe it is one of very few drug candidates in the market focused on the inhibition of p-STAT3, and that its mechanism of action is unique. Clinical research on WP1066 is currently focused on the treatment of adult GBM and childhood brain tumors, including DIPG. An industry recognized data source in late 2020 estimated that the incidence rate of primary malignant brain and central nervous system tumors in the U.S. is 7.4 cases per 100,000 person-years. This translates to an incidence of approximately 20,000 cases of malignant brain cancer per year. It is estimated that more than 81,000 people were living with a diagnosis of primary malignant brain and central nervous system tumor in the United States in 2000. In Europe in 2002, 33,000 people were diagnosed with primary brain/CNS cancers, and of which 85-90% are brain tumors. Incidence in Asians is significantly lower and based on the results of several large epidemiological studies, we estimate a Japanese incidence of close to 3,000 a year. Gliomas (mainly glioblastoma and astrocytomas) account for 78% of malignant tumors.
 
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) - also called: Pontine Glioma or Brainstem Glioma – is a type of pediatric (6-9 years old) tumor that starts in the brain stem. These tumors are called gliomas because they grow from glial cells, a type of supportive cell in the brain. DIPG falls into the Glioma staging system, so they can be classified according to the four stages below based on how the cells look under the microscope. The grades are from the least severe to the most severe: Low Grade: Grade I or II means that the tumor cells are the closest to normal; and High Grade: Grade III or IV means that these are the most aggressive tumors. The main issue with DIPG is that most of these tumors are not classified by grade because biopsy or removal of the tumor is not safe because of the location of the tumor, so they are diagnosed by their appearance on MRI. Symptoms usually develop rapidly in the majority of patients because of the fast growth of these tumors. The most common symptoms are issues related to balance and walking; eyes, chewing and swallowing, nausea and vomiting, headaches and facial weakness or drooping (usually one side). 10-20% of all pediatric gliomas are DIPG. DIPG impacts an estimated 200 to 400 children per year in the US alone. After diagnosis, median survival is usually nine months. Only 10% live for more than two years. When compared to pediatric glioblastoma, the prognosis for DIPG is the worst with less overall survival. There are no effective treatments for DIPG.
 
    19 

  

We believe there is a significant unmet need for an effective treatment for DIPG. While chemotherapy trials of over 200 drugs have not shown any impact on the disease, a DIPG patient in the first cohort of the Emory University study of WP1066 responded to treatment with both a radiologic reduction in tumor size and a clinical improvement in symptoms. While this is only an “n” of one, we believe the response this is important and encouraging, especially since we believe this was a subtherapeutic dose level. In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved our request for a "Rare Pediatric Disease" designation for our drug candidate WP1066. The designation may entitle us to receive a transferrable Priority Review Voucher (PRV) upon approval of an NDA for one of three indications, including DIPG, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. We believe that the early activity we are seeing in WP1066 is both surprising and encouraging. The approval of these three Rare Pediatric Disease designations is a reminder of just how important our efforts are to potentially help children with brain tumors. These vouchers are issued upon drug approval of the rare disease indication from the FDA and once issued, can be transferred to other drug developers. PRVs have historically had significant value and have recently been sold for up to $100 million or more. 
 
Additionally, WP1220 which is in the WP1066 Portfolio, has shown activity in a clinical trial for the treatment of CTCL. CTCL is a neoplastic transformation of T-lymphocytes and most often occurs between the ages of 40 and 60. Unlike other forms of non- Hodgkin lymphoma, CTCL is initially manifested as skin lesions (mycosis fungoides "MF"), but later stages involve lymph nodes, circulating tumor cells in the blood, as well as viscera. We use an industry respected database Informa Pharma Intelligence to form the following estimates. MF is considered a low-grade cutaneous lymphoma accounting for more than half of primary CTCLs. Early-stage MF (Stages I and II; ~70% of patients) is generally treated with skin-directed treatments (topical therapy) using systemic drugs that do not have significant side effects as secondary treatments. Advanced-stage MF requires more aggressive (systemic) therapies due to more extensive involvement of tissues and organs. Treatment is based mainly on a recently published European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guideline. A consensus guideline for clinical endpoints and response criteria to be incorporated into clinical trials was published. However due to the rarity of this disease, it has been difficult to perform randomized studies. There is currently no cure for this disease
 
The incidence of CTCL is approximately 16,000 worldwide in 2020 (US + EU 48%) and estimated to be growing to 18,000 by 2026. Asia has the highest incidence (38%). Prevalence is estimated to be 42,000 in US & EU growing to 45,000 with prevalence in Japan growing to a total of 49,000 by 2026. Since this is a chronic disease, we believe introduction of a new topical therapy that is more effective and less toxic than currently available topical drugs (if that is what is shown) would be important to this market. The US market was estimated to represent $40 million in annual sales in 2020, yet consists of technologies that are as much as 40 years old. Our WP1220 Proof of Concept (PoC) Trial for the treatment of CTCL was conducted in 5 patients, including the treatment of a total of 11 lesions and concluded with an objective response rate (ORR) of 45%, no adverse events and 55% stable disease, resulting in 100% clinical benefit. We believe that a significant unmet need remains for early stage (Stages IA through IIA) CTCL, and therefore, we believe a meaningful opportunity exists for WP1220.
 
Market for Our WP1122 Portfolio
 
Certain cancers depend heavily on glycolysis and glycosylation for growth and survival. Additionally, viruses depend on glycolysis and glycosylation for infectivity and replication. Glycolysis and glycosylation can be disrupted by using a glucose decoy known as 2-DG. While 2-DG has been shown to be effective in vitro and may have some activity in humans, its lack of drug-like properties limits its efficacy. Based on our preclinical testing in vitro (against cancers and viruses) and in vivo (against certain cancers only), WP1122 appears to improve the drug-like properties of 2-DG by creating a prodrug of 2-DG that reaches much higher tissue/organ concentrations than 2-DG alone. We believe WP1122 should be well suited as a treatment for highly glycolytic cancers such as GBM and pancreatic cancers.
 
In addition to the market for GBM described above, pancreatic cancer is a rare and difficult to treat form of cancer. Cancers of the exocrine pancreas are a very serious health issue in the United States where approximately 27,000 patients are diagnosed annually with pancreatic cancer while about the same number die annually from this disease. Due to difficulties in diagnosis, the intrinsic aggressive nature of pancreatic cancers, and the sparse systemic treatment options available, only approximately 4% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be alive five years after diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths following breast cancer; lung cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer.
 
Our License Agreements 
 
Sponsored Research and License Agreements with MD Anderson
 
We license all of our technology from MD Anderson and we also sponsor research there as well. Under license agreements associated with Annamycin, the WP1122 Portfolio, and the WP1066 Portfolio, all described below, we are responsible for certain license, milestone and royalty payments over the course of the agreements. Annual license fees, prior to the first sale of a licensed product, can be as high as $0.1 million depending upon the anniversary. Milestone payments for the commencement of phase II and phase III clinical trials can cost as high as $0.5 million. Other milestone payments for submission of an NDA to the FDA and receipt of first marketing approval for sale of a license product can be as high as $0.6 million. Royalty payments can range in the single digits as a percent of net sales on drug products or flat fees as high as $0.6 million, depending upon certain terms and conditions. Not all of these payments are applicable to every drug. Total expenses under these agreements were $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
    20 

  

We have a sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson that currently runs until the end of October 2021. The expenses recognized under the MD Anderson agreement with regards to the sponsored research agreement were $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In February 2021, we extended this Agreement until December 31, 2022 for total payment of $1.0 million spread over that period of time.
 
Annamycin
 
On June 29, 2017, we entered into an agreement with MD Anderson licensing certain technology related to the method of preparing Liposomal Annamycin. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
WP1066 Portfolio
 
The rights and obligations to a June 2010 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between Moleculin LLC and MD Anderson (the “Moleculin Agreement”) have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our WP1066 drug product candidate. In consideration, we must make payments to MD Anderson including an up-front payment, milestone payments and minimum annual royalty payments for sales of products developed under the license agreement. Annual maintenance fee payments will no longer be due upon marketing approval in any country of a licensed product. One-time milestone payments are due upon commencement of the first Phase III study for a licensed product within the United States, Europe, China or Japan; upon submission of the first NDA for a licensed product in the United States; and upon receipt of the first marketing approval for sale of a licensed product in the United States. The rights we have obtained pursuant to the assignment of the Moleculin Agreement are made subject to the rights of the US government to the extent that the technology covered by the licensed intellectual property was developed under a funding agreement between MD Anderson and the US government. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above.
 
In February 2018, we entered into a license agreement covering a new group of molecules recently discovered in connection with research we have been sponsoring at MD Anderson Cancer Center called WP1732, a part of the WP1066 Portfolio. As discussed above, we determined that the stability of WP1732 was less than satisfactory and, as such, in March 2021 we terminated our license for WP1732 with MD Anderson. 
 
WP1122 Portfolio
 
The rights and obligations to an April 2012 Patent and Technology License Agreement entered into by and between IntertechBio and MD Anderson have been assigned to us. Therefore, we have obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property, including patent rights, related to our WP1122 Portfolio and to our drug product candidate, WP1122. The terms and payments of which are included in the summary above. This agreement was amended in May 2020 to provide for extension of a certain milestone requirement and allowed for us to extend such milestone upon our request and extension payment. The initial milestone required us to file an IND with the FDA for a Phase I study by February 20, 2021. We extended the deadline for this milestone by six months by making the required extension payment, and we have the right to receive two additional six-month extensions in the future by making additional extension payments.
WPD Licensing Agreement 
 
On February 19, 2019, we sublicensed certain intellectual property rights, including rights to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio to WPD Pharmaceuticals (WPD), which sublicense was amended on March 22, 2021 (the “WPD Agreement”). WPD is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder.

Other Licenses
 
In 2015, we obtained the rights and obligations for certain patent and technology development and license agreements with Dermin sp. z o.o. (Dermin). In connection with such agreements, certain intellectual property rights related to Annamycin, our WP1122 portfolio, and our WP1066 portfolio were licensed to Dermin and Dermin was granted a royalty-bearing, exclusive license to manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, offer to sell and/or sell products in the field of human therapeutics under the licensed intellectual property. With respect to Annamycin, the license is limited to the countries of Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Greece, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Germany; provided that we had the right to remove Germany from the list of covered territories with a $0.5 million payment. With respect to WP1122, the license is limited to the countries of Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. With respect to WP1066, the license is limited to the countries of Belarus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. In each case, Dermin agreed to pay a royalty for the sale of any licensed product in the licensed territories and agreed to pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents for which the license has been granted in the licensed territories. Dermin also agreed to provide a percentage of certain consideration that Dermin receives pursuant to sublicense agreements. In July 2019, Dermin assigned its rights under the foregoing license agreements to an affiliated entity, Exploration Invest Pte Ltd. (Exploration). On July 30, 2019, we and Exploration entered into a License Modification Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to issue Exploration shares of Company common stock valued at $0.5 million (based on the greater of the closing price of the common stock on the date of the agreement or the 10-day average closing price prior to the date of the agreement) in exchange for the modifying the license agreements to: (i) limit the licensed territory solely to Poland; and (ii) limit the patent rights and technology rights licensed to Exploration to the patent rights and technology rights that existed on the date the original license agreements were entered into with Dermin. On August 8, 2019, we issued 71,663 shares of common stock (taking into account the reverse stock split completed January 29, 2021) to Exploration to satisfy this commitment.
Corporate History
 
We were founded in 2015 by Walter Klemp (our chairman and CEO), Dr. Don Picker (our Chief Science Officer) and Dr. Waldemar Priebe of MD Anderson (Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board) in order to combine and consolidate the development efforts involving several oncology technologies, based on license agreements with MD Anderson. Dr. Priebe is a Professor of Medicinal Chemistry in the Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Medicine, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This effort began with the acquisition of the Annamycin development project from AnnaMed, Inc. followed by the acquisition of the license rights to the WP1122 Portfolio from IntertechBio Corporation. Further, on behalf of Moleculin, LLC, we entered into a co-development agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which culminated with the merger of Moleculin, LLC into MBI coincident with our initial public offering allowing us to gain control of the WP1066 Portfolio.
 
In June 2018, we formed Moleculin Australia Pty. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary to oversee pre-clinical development in Australia. The Australian government provides an aggressive incentive for research and development carried out in their country. We believe having an Australian subsidiary could provide a great opportunity for quality, pre-clinical and clinical development and reduce the overall cost of our continued drug development efforts.
 
On January 29, 2021, we completed a one-for-six reverse stock split of our shares of common stock and proportionate reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from approximately 72,000,000 shares to approximately 12,000,000. The reverse stock split was effected in accordance with the authorization adopted by our stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive segment of the pharmaceutical market, which market is highly competitive as a whole. We face competition from numerous sources including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources. Additionally, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, and some may be in direct competition with us. We may also compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The unmet medical need for more effective cancer therapies is such that oncology drugs are one of the leading class of drugs in development. These include a wide array of products against cancer targeting many of the same indications as our drug candidates. While the introduction of newer targeted agents may result in extended overall survival, induction therapy regimens are likely to remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment in the foreseeable future.
 
There are a number of established therapies that may be considered competitive for the cancer indications for which we intend to develop our lead product candidate, Annamycin. A key consideration when treating AML patients is whether the patient is suitable for intensive therapy. The standard of care for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who can tolerate intensive therapy is cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin or daunorubicin), typically referred to as a “7+3” regimen. For some patients, primarily those less than 60 years of age, a stem cell transplant could also be considered if the induction regimen is effective in attaining a CR (Complete Response). The 7+3 regimen of cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline has been the standard of care for decades. A patient not suitable for intensive therapy may be offered the option for low-intensity therapy such as low-dose cytarabine, azacitidine or decitabine. It should be noted that, in the United States, these are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of AML patients and there remains no effective therapy for these patients or for relapsed or refractory AML, with the exception of some recently approved targeted therapies that have demonstrated a low level of activity for limited subgroups of AML patients. The initial focus for Annamycin development is in patients for whom the standard induction regimen has failed. Also, several major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs for the treatment of AML.
 
    23 

  

A number of attempts have been made or are under way to provide an improved treatment for AML. Celator Pharmaceuticals reported Phase III clinical trial results for a new combined formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin (commonly used induction therapy drugs) they call Vyxeos. This new liposome formulation provides a 5:1 ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin in each of three injections. When compared with patients receiving 7 injections of cytarabine and 3 injections of daunorubicin (traditional 7+3 induction therapy), patients receiving Vyxeos achieved an average increase in overall survival of approximately 3.5 months (9.5 months compared with 6 months). Despite this extension of overall survival, Vyxeos did not reduce the toxic side effects of daunorubicin (including cardiotoxicity) and it failed to qualify a majority of patients for curative bone marrow transplant. With these results, Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired Celator in 2016 and obtained FDA approval, making Vyxeos the new first line standard of care for the treatment of AML
 
Drugs attempting to target a subset of AML patients who present with specific gene mutations, such as one referred to as FLT3, have recently received FDA approval, but by definition serve only subsets of the AML population. Other targeted therapies are currently in clinical trials, as well as other approaches that include immunotherapy relying on other biomarkers, other attempts at improved chemotherapy and alternative approaches to radiation therapy. Other approaches to improve the effectiveness of induction therapy are in early-stage clinical trials and, although they do not appear to address the underlying problems with anthracyclines, we can provide no assurance that such improvements, if achieved, would not adversely impact the need for improved anthracyclines. A modified version of doxorubicin designed to reduce cardiotoxicity is in clinical trials for the treatment of sarcoma and, although this drug does not appear to address multidrug resistance and is not currently intended for the treatment of acute leukemia, we can provide no assurance that it will not become a competitive alternative to Annamycin. Although we are not aware of any other single agent therapies in clinical trials that would directly compete against Annamycin in the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML, we can provide no assurance that such therapies are not in development, will not receive regulatory approval and will reach market before our drug candidate Annamycin. In addition, any such competing therapy may be more effective and/or cost-effective than ours.
 
Competition for other indications targeted for each of our drug candidates is described above.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the US, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed and distributed.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable US requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA and related enforcement activity could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the US generally involves the following:
 

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices and in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (GCP), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced, to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    24 

  


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals, and continued compliance are inherently uncertain.
 
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of the single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations, laws and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies for various reasons. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical study.
 
Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
 
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1: The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients, with a goal of characterizing the safety profile of the drug and establishing a maximum tolerable dose (MTD). Our pharmaceutical products fall into this latter category because its products are intended to treat cancer and contain cytotoxic agents. Hence, our Phase 1 studies are conducted in late-stage cancer patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with other agents.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: With the maximum tolerable dose established in a Phase 1 trial, the pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population at the MTD to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are usually required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. In some instances, an NDA approval may be obtained based on Phase 2 clinical data with the understanding that the approved drug can be sold subject to a confirmatory trial to be conducted post-approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    25 

  


• | Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are often used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also may require Phase 4 studies, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) and post-marketing surveillance, among other things, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies may complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees. A waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months after the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard review NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months after the 60-day filing date for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.
 
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new pharmaceutical products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious condition and data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, if the FDA determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for market, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and it offers a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will move more quickly in its review of such products in an effort to complete the review four months sooner than a standard review. Additionally, accelerated approval may be available for a product intended to treat a serious condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, which means the product may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing an effect on a surrogate endpoint or on an intermediate clinical endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any pharmaceutical products for which the Company receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the US Department of Justice and/or US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.
 
We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Patent Term Restoration 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our products covered by US patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process for a product the approval of which is the first permitted commercial marketing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a date 14 years after the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent unless an extension is obtained. The US Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and renders a decision on the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may be able to apply for extension of patent term for one or more of our currently licensed patents or any future owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. We cannot be certain that any of our products will qualify for patent term restoration or, if so, for how long the patent term will be extended.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not, and frequently do not, include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we may receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 
In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
