ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
    Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc., a Delaware corporation (‘‘IEA’’, the ‘‘Company’’, ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’, or ‘‘our’’) is a holding company that, through various subsidiaries, is a leading diversified infrastructure construction company with specialized energy and heavy civil expertise throughout the United States (“U.S.”). We were founded in 1947 as White Construction and we became a public company in March 2018 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company. Our Common Stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ‘‘IEA’’. 
The Company specializes in providing complete engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services throughout the U.S. for the renewable energy, traditional power and civil infrastructure industries. In 2019, Engineering News-Record (“ENR”) ranked IEA as the 2nd leading provider of wind EPC services based on revenue. These services include the design, site development, construction, installation and restoration of infrastructure. We believe we have the ability to continue to expand these services to leverage our expertise and relationships in the wind energy business to provide additional infrastructure solutions to the clean energy markets.
The acquisitions we made in 2018 have expanded our construction capabilities and geographic footprint in the areas of environmental remediation, industrial maintenance, specialty paving, heavy civil and rail infrastructure construction, creating a diverse national platform of specialty construction capabilities. See Note 2. Merger and Acquisitions in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information on the acquisitions.
Reportable Segments
    The Company operates its business in two reportable segments:
Renewables Segment
    The Renewables segment operates throughout the U.S. and specializes in a range of services that include full EPC project delivery, design, site development, construction, installation and maintenance of infrastructure services for the wind and solar industries.
We have maintained a heavy focus on construction of renewable power production capacity as renewable energy, particularly from wind and solar, has become widely accepted within the electric utility industry and has become a cost-effective solution for the creation of new generating capacity.
Specialty Civil Segment
    The Specialty Civil segment operates throughout the U.S. and specializes in a range of services that include:
•Environmental remediation services such as site development, environmental site closure, outsourced contract mining and coal ash management services.

•Rail Infrastructure services such as planning, design, procurement, construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects for major railway and intermodal facilities.
•Heavy civil construction services such as road and bridge construction, specialty paving, industrial maintenance and other local, state and government projects.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows:

Retention of strong relationships with our customers to expand services offered — We believe that we have strong, long-term relationships with each of our customers and have historically worked together with them to meet their needs. By leveraging our established relationships with these customers, we intend to provide expanded products and services that will continue to diversify our revenue streams and assist our customers with their business strategies.
    Maintain Operational Excellence — We have a continual focus on maintaining operational excellence, which includes the following:
•Quality - We believe in satisfying our clients, mitigating risk, and driving improvement by performing work right the first time.
•Technical Expertise - We have an established reputation for safe, high quality performance, reliable customer service and technical expertise in constructing technically demanding projects.
•Safety - We believe the safety of our employees, the public and the environment is a moral obligation as well as good business. By identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards, we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents.
•Productivity - We strive to use our resources efficiently to deliver work on time and on budget.
    Ownership of Equipment — Many of our services are equipment intensive and certain key equipment used by us is specialized or customized for our businesses. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership and if needed, ability to lease a large and varied construction fleet at a reasonable cost, enables us to compete more effectively by ensuring availability and maximizing returns on investment of the equipment.
Maintain a strong balance sheet and an optimal capital structure — We believe that continued focus on our capital structure provides our customers, our lenders, and our bonding companies assurance of our financial capabilities. We will continue to focus on optimizing our capital structure in order to find the best mix of debt and equity financing that can maximize the Company's market value while minimizing our cost of capital. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability and, if needed, to augment our liquidity needs.
Future Strategic Acquisitions and Arrangements — We will continue to pursue selected and opportunistic acquisitions, that fit our strategy of acquiring businesses with complementary cultures, niche market capabilities, excellent relationships with blue chip customers and strong, proven management teams that are retained post acquisition.
Customers
    We have longstanding customer relationships with many established companies in the renewable energy, thermal power, environmental remediation, civil and industrial power industries, with a recurring base of blue-chip utility customers, as well as with original equipment manufacturers that produce the equipment for our business. We have completed renewable projects for top U.S. developers and owners, rail infrastructure projects with top tier railroads and heavy civil construction projects with many government agencies.
    Although we are not dependent upon any one customer in any year, a relatively small number of repeat customers constitute a substantial portion of our total revenues. Accordingly, our senior management is responsible for developing and maintaining existing relationships with customers to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Our management is also focused on pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.
    The Company had the following approximate revenue and accounts receivable concentrations, net of allowances, for the periods ended:

 | Revenue % | Accounts Receivable %
 | Year Ended December 31, | December 31, 
 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | | 2020 | | 2019
Company A (Renewables Segment) | * | * | 21.0 | | | * | | *
Company B (Specialty Civil Segment) | * | 10.9 | | * | | * | | *

———
* Amount was not above 10% threshold.
    Our work is generally performed pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire complex of specified units within an infrastructure system. Generally, customers are billed monthly throughout the completion of work on a project; however, some contracts provide for additional billing upon the achievement of specific completion milestones, which may increase the billing period to more than one month. Many contracts may include retainage provisions under which, generally, from 5% to 10% of the contract price is withheld until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer. 
    We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. 
Backlog
    Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize in 2021 and beyond from the uncompleted portions of existing construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun and awarded contracts for which the definitive project documentation is being prepared, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Estimated backlog for work under fixed price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. These contracts are included in backlog based on the estimated total contract price upon completion. 
    The following table summarizes our backlog by segment for December 31:

(in millions) | | 
Segments | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2019
Renewables | $ | 1,513.4 | | $ | 1,582.5
Specialty Civil | 556.1 | | 588.7 | 
Total | $ | 2,069.5 | | $ | 2,171.2

We expect to realize approximately $1,628.9 million of our estimated backlog during 2021 and $440.6 million during 2022 and beyond.
    Based on historical trends in the Company’s backlog, we believe awarded contracts to be firm and that the revenue for such contracts will be recognized over the life of the project. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory factors, COVID-19 pandemic, weather and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. In the past, we have occasionally experienced postponements, cancellations and reductions on construction projects due to market volatility and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings and may not result in actual revenue or profits.
    Backlog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP, although it is a common measurement used in our industry. Backlog also differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. See 
‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of the risks associated with our backlog. As of December 31, 2020, total backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations primarily due to the inclusion of contracts that were awarded but not yet fully executed. 
Competition
    We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, and some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform some of the services we provide.

    The primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation, quality and delivery, relevant expertise, adequate financial resources, geographic presence, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. We believe that our national platform, track record of completion, relationships with vendors, strong safety record and access to skilled labor enables us to compete favorably in all of these factors. We also believe that our ability to provide unionized and non-unionized workforces across a national footprint allows us to compete for a broad range of projects. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process. We believe our safety record, experience, quality of service and price are often principal factors in determining which service provider is selected.
Seasonality
    Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, receipt of required regulatory approvals, permits and rights of way, project timing and schedules and holidays. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business.’’
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
    We strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees, and we require that our employees participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety performance and the safety performance of the employees they supervise. Our business units have established robust safety programs to encourage, monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations including, behavioral based safety, jobsite safety analysis, site-specific safety orientation, subcontractor orientation, site safety audits, accident and incident safety investigations, OSHA 30-hour and 10-hour training, drug and alcohol testing and regular trainings in fall protection, confined spaces, crane rigging and flagman, first aid, CPR and AED, among others.
    Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we may be subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. We maintain insurance policies for worker’s compensation, employer liability, automobile liability, general liability, inland marine property and equipment, professional and pollution liability, excess liability, and director and officers’ liability. See Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements.
    Our business may subject us to the risk of adverse site conditions and unfavorable weather. While we mitigate these risks contractually to the extent possible, market conditions prevent us from fully passing these risks to our customers, and there is not a robust insurance market to cover these risks. While we have evaluated the feasibility of insurance products to mitigate weather risk, we do not believe that the current insurance market offers commercially practicable solutions to protect the Company against significant losses caused by adverse weather.
Suppliers and Materials
    Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects, such as wind turbines, and we are responsible for the installation, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent upon any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage.
    We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help manage our work flow. Our independent 
contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. 
    We bear some risk of increases in the price of materials and supplies used in the performance of our work, such as aggregate, reinforced steel, cable, and fuel. These risks are managed contractually, by entering into contracts with suppliers that fix the price paid by the Company within the budget established for a project, or by passing the risk of commodity cost increases to the customer.
Regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations including:
•licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;
•regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection;
•permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;
•wage and hour regulations;
•regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements;
•building and electrical codes; and
•special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. However, we could incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Environmental and Climate Change Matters
    We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
    The potential impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensity and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather and major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity and increases in certain other costs, which could negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
Production Tax Credit (the ‘‘PTC’’) and Investment Tax Credit (‘‘ITC’’)
    In light of changes in federal government priorities and the cost-competitiveness of wind and solar power production, certain of the tax credits for production of renewable energy are phasing out. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (‘‘CAA’’), which contains certain federal tax incentives applicable to the renewable energy industry, provided for the gradual elimination of certain of these incentives. In December 2020, the federal government implemented an agreement that extended lapsed and expiring tax breaks. The extension provides a one year extension of the PTC for wind projects at a 60% level for projects that begin construction on or before December 31, 2021 and a two year extension of 26% ITC for projects that begin construction before January 1, 2023 and 22% ITC for projects that begin construction before January 1, 2024 for all solar projects placed into service prior to December 31, 2025.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 745 salaried employees and 2,627 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel employed is subject to the volume of specialty services and construction work in progress.
We believe that our employees are the most valuable resource in successfully completing our projects. Our ability to maintain sufficient, continuous work for hourly employees helps us to maintain a stable workforce with a loyalty to and an understanding of our policies and culture and contributes to our strong performance, safety and quality record. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. In addition, we have partnerships with technical schools where we recruit and hire craft employees.
We employ a dynamic mix of people to create the strongest company possible. Our policy forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive, diverse company with people of all backgrounds, experience, culture, styles and talents.
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs.
We strive to develop and sustain a skilled labor advantage by providing on and off-site training programs, project management training, and leadership development programs. Our leadership development program is designed to further develop each participant’s leadership skills and requires program participants to challenge themselves and their peers as they progress.
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on above-average workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews monthly, and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a safety
