--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on August 26, 2020 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on the industries that complement our management team’s background, and to capitalize on their demonstrated ability to identify and acquire businesses, focusing on healthcare services and related industries in the United States.
 
On December 28, 2020, we consummated an initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 33,120,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, which included the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option in the amount of 4,320,000 units, generating gross proceeds to us of $331,200,000. Each unit consisted of one share of our Class A common stock (the “Public Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of an aggregate of 8,624,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant with Healthcare Services Acquisition Holdings, LLC (our “Sponsor”) and certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc. (our “Anchor Investor”).
 
Our Sponsor and each of our independent directors (collectively, our “Initial Stockholders”) collectively own an aggregate of 8,280,000 shares of our Class B common stock, which shares will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder.
 
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount of $331,200,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants in the Private Placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders and the underwriter of the initial public offering, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations and to pay up to $100,000 in dissolution expenses, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or during any stockholder-approved extension period, subject to applicable law.

 Table of Contents     We intend to partner with the management and owners of technology-enabled healthcare services companies seeking an alternative to a traditional IPO. Our management team will deploy a proactive sourcing strategy and focus our efforts on companies where we believe the combination of their operating experience, deal making and capital allocation prowess, professional relationships and tactical expertise can be catalysts to enhance the growth potential and value of a target business.
 
We believe that the technology-enabled healthcare services industry presents an attractive set of opportunities to pursue a business combination. Specifically, the industry is highly fragmented and demands specialization to access attractive companies. Many of these companies exhibit attractive financial profiles and are capable of serving as platform companies.
 
The traditional IPO process entails significant preparation, commitment of time and resources, and entails meaningful uncertainty. As a result, management and owners are searching for viable alternatives and partners to facilitate superior access to the public markets. We believe that the combined experience of our management team and board of directors represents a compelling alternative combined with the potential for long-term value creation.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our management team and directors will offer distinctive competitive advantages to our stockholders in the pursuit of a target opportunity.
 
Broad network across the healthcare industry. Our management team believes that its reputation, experience, and relationships across all sectors within the healthcare industry will provide preferential access to proprietary investment opportunities that are not broadly marketed. The healthcare industry is complex, highly specialized, and significantly less accessible to generalist investors who cannot draw upon deep relationships within the sector. Finally, our management team’s extensive industry knowledge and expertise supports a highly proactive sourcing approach to educate (as well as pursue) potential targets on the benefits of a capital-enabled business combination, thereby creating potential new acquisition opportunities.
 
Demonstrated track record across public and private companies. Our management team has broad experience working with both public and private companies. From 1998 to 2012, David Blair, our Chief Executive Officer, was CEO of Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc. During Mr. Blair’s 14-year tenure at Catalyst (13 years as a public company), he helped to deliver substantial revenue growth and cumulative stockholder returns outstripping the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Health Care Index over an equivalent period of time. Since stepping down from Catalyst following its sale in 2012, Mr. Blair launched a diverse healthcare services holding company, Accountable Health Solutions, Inc., where he serves as Executive Chairman, that has also generated strong returns for its private investors by focusing on investments in companies that control costs and improve access and overall quality of healthcare. We believe this track record as a value-added partner will “open doors” at target management teams excited about partnering with us.

 Table of Contents     Deep experience in mergers, acquisitions, and integrations. Our management team has deep experience in driving value-accretive inorganic growth through sourcing, executing, and integrating M&A transactions. Over its life cycle, the senior management team at Catalyst, which included Mr. Blair and Martin Payne, our President, successfully integrated over a dozen acquisitions. Notable acquisitions included the $525 million acquisition of Walgreens Health Initiatives, Inc. in 2011, the pharmacy benefit management subsidiary of Walgreen Co. During the integration process from 2011-2012, the Catalyst management team significantly reduced operating expenses, increased customers and retained Walgreen Co. as a primary customer. In 2019, Messrs. Blair and Payne worked together to successfully recapitalize HRGi, a healthcare cost containment company, substantially enhancing value for the principal stakeholders. We believe this deep experience will compound our advantages in executing our investment thesis.
 
A proven playbook for value creation. Our management team has repeatedly executed our “playbook” in its work at Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc. and subsequently. Our playbook for value creation rests on four key levers that reinforce and compound each other. These levers are primarily organic but can also be applied to inorganic contexts as well:
 

• | Driving cost and margin efficiencies
--+-------------------------------------


• | Enabling the company to participate in previously out-of-reach growth opportunities
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving excess cash flow to facilitate superior capital allocation
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Feeding a virtuous cycle of multiple expansion in public markets
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our management team’s track record and ability to repeatedly execute these four levers as opportunities present themselves are core to our business strategy.
 
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background and capitalize on their ability to identify and acquire a business, focusing on healthcare services and related industries in the United States. We believe the healthcare services industry is unique and attractive for a number of reasons:
Large and Growing Market Opportunity. The healthcare services industry represents a massive market opportunity. Total U.S. national healthcare expenditure reached $3.6 trillion in 2018, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has estimated that total healthcare spending will approach 20% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product over the coming years. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 Economic Census, there are over 4,500 companies with more than 500 employees in the health care and social assistance, and health and medical insurance sectors.
 
 5
 
 Table of Contents     Macro Trends. Total U.S. healthcare expenditure has grown and is projected to continue to grow at a pace of 5.4% from 2019 through 2028, substantially above the rate of inflation, as estimated by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Explanatory factors for this growth include an aging population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and improved access to healthcare product and services. This growth trajectory has put significant pressure on payors, which suggests favorable trends for healthcare companies that can control costs while improving access and overall quality of healthcare. Messrs. Blair and Payne have specialized in identifying these opportunities, and overseeing healthcare companies that have achieved these goals, throughout their careers.
 
Increased emphasis due to COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and amplified the attention paid to the U.S. healthcare system. Public and private entities are placing an increasing emphasis on the resilience and stability of the system, in particular shortening supply chains, reducing reliance on offshore suppliers, and improving reliability and efficiency. This dynamic will favor domestic companies that can reduce cost and improve quality of and access to care.
 
Significant addressable market of targets. The growth in healthcare expenditure has put pressure on all industry participants to manage costs. This required evolution of industry participants, combined with the fragmented nature of the healthcare industry, creates a landscape that we believe is conducive of potential investment opportunities. We intend to focus our target company search across the breadth of the healthcare services industry, including medical, dental, pharmaceutical and behavioral health services, with an emphasis across the full value chain including benefit management, healthcare information technology, supply chain or business support services, and cost containment solutions. We believe our investment and operating expertise in healthcare services across multiple industry verticals will give us a significant addressable market of potential targets. The breadth of this market increases the likelihood that our management team will be successful in executing an attractive transaction.
 
Industry credibility required to invest in healthcare. Our management team believes the complexity and insularity of the healthcare industry requires investors and management to have significant industry-specific knowledge, expertise and a credible track record to identify, diligence and execute investment opportunities and operate and govern them thereafter. These hurdles, which include technical and scientific knowledge, an understanding of the reimbursement and regulatory environment, complex valuation and deal structuring, specialized accounting treatments, and regulatory and political uncertainty, among other considerations, may deter competition from other investors.

Gaps in access, quality and affordability of healthcare. Despite healthcare reform initially leading to large coverage gains, significant healthcare disparities persisted and, in some cases, widened. Our management team is committed to closing these gaps and believes it requires ongoing technological innovation, increasing attention towards the social determinants of health, and continued cost containment in addition to public policy actions and fiscal support. These challenging dynamics will continue to put pressure on healthcare services companies to act with speed, creativity and resilience-and reward those that can do so-regardless of the regulatory or political environment.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Healthcare is a huge industry that is expected to approach 20% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product over the coming years. Despite its size, the industry remains heavily fragmented and increasingly “bifurcated” between large, publicly-traded, at-scale companies and a much larger number of smaller, predominantly private companies. As a result of this bifurcation, the capabilities gap between larger, national players and smaller, local players has widened. Meanwhile, the sheer size of national players suggest they have less available time, resources, and willingness to consolidate smaller players, who are “trapped” at subscale size and reach. Our team believes this market discontinuity creates opportunities for investors who can offer both capital and strategic/operational expertise.
 
Our acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire one or more compelling target opportunities that have the capability to grow out of the “trap” through strong organic and strategic consolidation, close the gap to national-level capabilities, and become a successful public company. We believe that our management team’s and directors’ experience evaluating assets through investing and building companies will enable us to source the highest quality targets.
 
 6
 
 Table of Contents     We will focus on targeting companies across the full healthcare services value chain including benefit management, healthcare information technology, supply chain or business support services, and cost containment solutions. When evaluating a prospective target, we expect to conduct a two-track diligence process in parallel:

• | Traditional due diligence. We will conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things: meetings with incumbent management and employees; document reviews; inspection of facilities; as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic business plan build. We will work hand-in-hand with incumbent management to jointly build a strategic business plan in order to guide the company’s growth, operations, and strategy following a business combination. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In identifying targets and co-creating our strategic business plan, we will focus on opportunities where our playbook will find the most resonance. In addition and consistent with our acquisition strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities. However, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines:


• | Established companies with good reputations and track records, but meaningful opportunities for strategic repositioning and operational improvements
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth prospects constrained by capital availability, operational expertise and national-scale capabilities, where the provision of one or more would enable participation in previously off-limits commercial opportunities
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliable demand profile that would drive recurring revenue
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant untapped white space in home or adjacent markets
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive advantage relative to other players
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Appropriate valuation
--+----------------------


• | Benefits from being a public company
--+-------------------------------------


• | Ambitious management who welcome our capital and the involvement of our management team as a growth enabler
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management team may deem relevant.
 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of our independent directors, to the extent required by applicable law or our board of directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm.
 
Our Sponsor, our directors and members of our management team directly or indirectly own our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and/or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
 7
 
 Table of Contents     Each of our officers and directors presently has, or may in the future have, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present the opportunity to such entity, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time amount various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 
Our officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, and in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
Effecting our initial business combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Public Shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the funds held in the trust account, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.

 Table of Contents     Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various sources, including our global networks, as well as other sources such as investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus filed in connection with the initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our Sponsor, officers and directors and their respective affiliates may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our Sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with, any services rendered in order to effectuate the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of net assets test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

 Table of Contents     To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and key employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination or Certain Stockholder Votes to Amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon (i) the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. Such redemptions, if any, will be made at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the event triggering the right to redeem, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to certain limitations. The amount in the trust account was initially $10.00 per Public Share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its Public Shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to the Public Warrants or the Private Placement Warrants. Our Sponsor and each of our officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of our Class B common stock and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination or a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions in Conjunction with a Stockholder Vote on our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.
 
 10
 
 Table of Contents     If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
 11
 
 Table of Contents     If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our Initial Stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor and each of our officers and directors have agreed to vote their shares of Class B common stock and any Public Shares purchased during or after this offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our shares of Class B common stock, we would need only 12,420,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or 2,070,001, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 33,120,000 Public Shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our Initial Stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriting commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management team to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

 Table of Contents     Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period or any stockholder approved extension period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Public Warrants or Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period, as may be extended by any stockholder approved extension period.
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which may include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its Public Shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their Public Shares.

 Table of Contents     There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a Public Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

 Table of Contents     If a proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of this offering or during any stockholder approved extension period.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation may give others with greater resources an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
