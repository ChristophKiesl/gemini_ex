ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
 
BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations. The Company focused on implementing a new operational direction.  After a thorough evaluation process, the Company found that there is a substantial long-term demand for specific commodities relating to battery and new energy technologies. This presents a timely and unique opportunity based on rising demand characteristics.  By capitalizing on market trends and current sustainable energy government mandates and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, we will focus on bringing a vertically-integrated solution to market.
Asset Sale
 
On March 18, 2019, the Company approved an asset sale of the assets related to the legacy MiniMelts brand for $350,000 in cash, which was approved by a majority of its shareholders.

Part of the proceeds from the sale was used to retire certain lease obligations as well as for general operating purposes.
