Our Mission
Our mission is to secure the digital world through Intelligent Identity.
Overview
Ping Identity is the Intelligent Identity solution for the enterprise. We enable companies to achieve Zero Trust identity-defined security and more personalized, streamlined user experiences. The Ping Intelligent Identity Platform provides customers, workforce and partners with secure, convenient access to their applications whether they are software-as-a-service (“SaaS”), mobile, in the cloud or on-premise. We leverage artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) to analyze device, network, application and user behavior data to make real-time authentication and security control decisions, enhancing the user experience. Our platform is designed to detect anomalies and automatically insert additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, only when necessary. We built our platform to meet the requirements of the most demanding enterprises, including over 60% of the Fortune 100. Our cloud-based platform has differentiated deployment flexibility to support multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructures to meet the diverse and demanding requirements of large enterprise customers. Our platform offers a comprehensive suite of turnkey integrations and is able to scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment.
​
Enterprises are undergoing an acceleration of their digital transformation initiatives as they seek to adapt to work-from-home realities, create new revenue streams, transition to new digital business models and increase customer engagement. Concurrently, enterprises are becoming more distributed as the adoption of cloud, mobile, global and remote workforces and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) move data, applications and access requirements beyond the traditional network perimeter. These enterprises must contend with an evolving cyber-threat landscape, new privacy directives and stringent regulatory requirements. As a result, enterprises require Intelligent Identity solutions that proactively ensure the right user has authorized access to resources at the appropriate time.
​
The Ping Intelligent Identity Platform can secure all primary identity use cases, including customer, workforce, partner and IoT. For example, enterprises can use our platform to enhance their customers’ user experience by creating a single ID and login across web and mobile properties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 45% of our subscription revenue was derived from the customer use case. Enterprises can also use our platform to provide their workforce and commercial partners with secure, seamless access from any device to the applications, data and APIs they need to be productive. 
​
The Ping Intelligent Identity Platform is comprised of multiple solutions that can be purchased individually or integrated as a more complete set of solutions for the customer, workforce, partner or IoT use case:
​

● | secure single sign-on (“SSO”);
--+-------------------------------


● | adaptive multi-factor authentication (“MFA”);
--+----------------------------------------------


● | security control for applications and APIs (“Access Security”);

● | identity verification services to prove an individual’s identity with facial biometrics and government issued IDs; (“Identity Verification”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AI and ML powered API security (“API Intelligence”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------

We have spent over a decade building a comprehensive suite of turnkey integrations designed to ensure that enterprises can use our platform to secure their entire application portfolio no matter where it is deployed, facilitating rapid time-to-value and easier management.
​
We sell our solutions via a subscription model through a direct sales force, with increasing influence from our channel partners. We also utilize channel partners and system integrators to assist our customers in the implementation process. Our SSO, Access Security and Directory solutions typically replace legacy and homegrown systems. We also have significant greenfield opportunities with our MFA, Dynamic Authorization, Risk Management, Identity Verification and API Intelligence solutions and the IoT use case.
​
Our land and expand strategy targets enterprises with a specific use case and solution or solution package, and then seeks to grow our footprint with additional use cases, identities, solutions and solution packages. The success of our strategy is validated by our strong dollar-based net retention rates, which were 108% and 115% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our growing number of large customers. At December 31, 2020, we had 51 customers with greater than $1,000,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), an increase of 34% from 38 customers at December 31, 2019. Additionally, our customers with ARR over $250,000 increased from 232 at December 31, 2019 to 260 at December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 12%. The increase of 28 net customers with ARR greater than $250,000 for the 2020 fiscal year is comprised of 16 new customers and 12 existing customers that had ARR grow to exceed $250,000 in 2020. Our total customer count increased from 1,361 at December 31, 2019 to 1,411 at December 31, 2020. We have seen strong market demand for our cloud-based offerings and from enterprises deploying our solutions across the customer use case. A number of our customers deploy a combination of our solutions across multiple business units, functions and use cases. For definitions of ARR and dollar-based net retention rate and descriptions of how we calculate these metrics, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
​
Our customers include many of the world’s largest enterprises, including over 60% of the Fortune 100. These customers are security-focused, and typically operate in regulated industries, have hybrid IT infrastructures, require turnkey integrations and have demanding scalability requirements. Our solutions secure 13 of the 15 largest U.S. banks (measured by assets), 7 of the 9 largest healthcare companies (measured by revenue), 5 of the 7 largest North American retailers (measured by revenue), the 5 largest global aerospace companies (measured by revenue) and the 5 largest European auto manufacturers (measured by revenue). Our customer base is diversified, with no one customer or reseller accounting for more than 3% or 7% of our total revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
​
We have consistently been recognized as a leader in the Identity and Access Management (“IAM”) industry by Gartner and other analysts. For example, Gartner’s Magic Quadrant research on access management has named Ping Identity a leader for the last four years. Other analysts that have named Ping Identity a leader in 2020 include KuppingerCole, ISG and SPARK Matrix for reports covering identity solutions for Customers, Workforce, and IoT.
​
Since our inception, we have been an innovator in identity. We pioneered the concept of Intelligent Identity, which leverages AI and ML to analyze device, network, application and user behavior data to secure access and enhance the user experience. We founded Ping Identity with the vision of enabling enterprise security in a highly-connected world, replacing legacy security controls such as web gateways, virtual private networks (“VPNs”) and firewalls. We contributed to or co-authored many of the open identity standards such as SAML, OAuth, SCIM and OpenID Connect, which form the foundation of our industry.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | configure risk policies that aggregate multiple risk predictors to calculate a single risk score; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | risk dashboards to view reports on detected malicious activity in an organization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identity Verification. Our Identity Verification solution enables enterprises to allow their customers to securely and conveniently verify their identity during enrollment and registration. This provides organizations with an increased level of assurance in the identity of their customers during the onboarding process to prevent fraudulent account creation and activity. Our solution can be integrated into an organization’s mobile application to prompt customers to provide a live face capture and to scan a government-issued ID using their mobile device. The customer’s identity is verified using our solution by matching the live face capture to the image on the government ID and validating the identification document for authenticity. Our Identity Verification solution enables enterprises in regulated industries, such as financial services and insurance, to meet Know Your Customer (“KYC”) requirements by providing customers a method to prove their identity. Our advanced Identity Verification features include:

● | liveness detection to ensure the end-user is a real, live person;

Innovation is at the core of what we do. Approximately one-third of our employees are devoted to research and development. Our research and development efforts are focused on building industry leading solutions, addressing all primary use cases, enhancing deployment flexibility and providing seamless integration across cloud and on-premise applications. We believe that the ongoing and timely development of new solutions and features is imperative to maintaining our competitive position. We continue to invest in our solutions across our development centers in Denver, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Tel Aviv, Israel; Vancouver, Canada; and Bangalore, India.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, trademarks and patents to protect our intellectual property rights.
We control access to, and use of, our solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology, and such risks may increase as we attempt to expand into jurisdictions where such rights are less easily enforced, or are more subject to reverse engineering or misappropriation due to local legal requirements.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 34 issued United States patents and 16 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. Our issued United States patents expire between December 14, 2031 and October 12, 2038. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our existing patents and any that are issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Competition
We face competition from (1) legacy providers, (2) cloud-only providers and (3) homegrown solutions.
Legacy providers include Broadcom, IBM and Oracle, among others. These providers generally designed their solutions when enterprise applications were monolithic and on-premise. Their solutions utilize proprietary architectures, which require customized features and integrations to scale. Today, these solutions have the reputation of being complex, costly and increasingly fragile. Thus, legacy providers often struggle to offer a single comprehensive solution that spans all IT environments, including cloud and on-premise.
We also compete with cloud-only providers, such as Okta and OneLogin, that primarily focus on the workforce use case. These providers have solutions that are historically geared towards small and medium-sized businesses that have IT infrastructures hosted entirely in the cloud. The vast majority of large enterprises do not have the ability to operate their businesses solely with cloud infrastructures, and thus require enterprise solutions that support complex hybrid IT environments and the wide variety of applications and workloads found in enterprise IT portfolios. Thus, a cloud-only IAM solution cannot deliver a single comprehensive solution that enterprises require to provide end-to-end coverage across their complex IT landscape.
Microsoft also competes in our market and has tied its identity services to both Azure and its Office365 offerings. However, we partner with Microsoft to provide SSO, security control and adaptive MFA where non-Microsoft environments require integration or independence is preferred. Microsoft’s integration and interoperability with our solutions benefits enterprises while providing optionality and choice.

We believe the principal competitive factors in the IAM market include: (1) the ability to address all primary use cases from one platform; (2) the ability to deploy in large, complex hybrid IT environments; (3) the ability to integrate easily with all applications (cloud and on-premise); (4) technology uptime, reliability, scalability and performance; (5) the ability to support open standards; and (6) customer, technology and platform support. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,022 employees across six global regions including Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Israel and the U.S.
We recognize that our ability to attract, develop and retain talent is key to our success. We have high employment engagement and consider our relationship with employees very strong, with 93% of employees recommending us as a great place to work. We are proud of the consistent work ethic our employees displayed during 2020; we pivoted quickly and efficiently to a remote working environment because of the flexibility and resiliency of our committed employee base.
At Ping Identity, trust is core to who we are and what we do. We know that how we work together is just as important as what we accomplish. We believe that our customers, partners and employees are on the same team striving for the same goals, and the best teams rely on a foundation of trust. We treat all who enter the Ping Identity ecosystem with respect and honesty, and always keep our commitments.
