Item 1. Business.
Overview
 References herein to “we,” “us,” “Company” and “Aduro” refer to Aduro Biotech, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states otherwise.
 We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that are designed to harness the body's natural immune system for the treatment of patients with challenging diseases. Our primary technologies related to the cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase – Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS-STING) and A Proliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL) pathways have led to what we believe is a strong pipeline of clinical candidates that are being investigated in cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are collaborating with leading global pharmaceutical companies to help expand and drive our product pipeline. Our strategy is to rapidly advance first- or best-in-class therapies from our STING and APRIL technologies through clinical development and regulatory approval.  
 Our STING pathway activator technology is designed to activate the intracellular STING receptor, which may result in a potent tumor-specific immune response. We are developing STING pathway activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis. ADU-S100 (MIW815), the first STING pathway activator to enter the clinic, is being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial of ADU-S100 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an approved anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, as first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We are preparing to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of ADU-S100 as a single agent administered intravesically in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who are unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an approved intravesical immunotherapy, in the second half of 2020. ADU-S100 (MIW815) has also been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial as a single agent and in a Phase 1b combination trial with spartalizumab (PDR001), an investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas.
 APRIL is a soluble factor that binds to B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor, or TACI, receptors thereby inducing signaling, and is believed to be implicated in IgA nephropathy and other indications. BION-1301, a first-in-class fully blocking monoclonal antibody that blocks APRIL binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and patients with IgA nephropathy.
 In addition to our current STING pathway product candidates that activate the STING receptor, we are developing product candidates that are designed to prevent or control immune responses through the STING pathway as part of our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program under a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly. Our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program involves the research and development of novel inhibitor product candidates for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.
 We have intellectual property protection on our STING and APRIL technologies and each of our product candidates, some of which we believe can be maintained into 2040.
 Our Strategy
 We aim to discover, develop and commercialize therapies to treat challenging diseases based on our cGAS-STING and APRIL pathway technologies. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Rapidly advance therapies from our STING and APRIL technologies through discovery, clinical development and regulatory approval. We are developing novel drug candidates by leveraging our proprietary technologies and understanding of the cGAS-STING and APRIL pathways. We have proprietary technologies that we believe can generate novel and combinable therapies to target disease indications with significant unmet medical need.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand on the value of our product candidates through partnerships. We may decide to selectively partner product candidates in certain geographies and where we believe a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of our product candidates. We have strategic partnerships with Novartis for STING pathway activator product candidates in oncology, Lilly for cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor product candidates in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck, to advance an anti-CD27 agonist. We believe these partnerships have the potential to drive significant value through the extensive capabilities of these organizations.

• | Maximize the value of our proprietary STING and APRIL pathway programs through the retention of commercial rights in key markets. We retain U.S. commercial rights for STING pathway activator product candidates in oncology developed in collaboration with Novartis. In addition, we maintain full ownership of our APRIL pathway product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the expertise of our scientific founders and key advisors to develop innovative technologies at the forefront of immunotherapy. Our scientific founders and advisors are from some of the world’s leading research institutions and have a history of seminal discoveries and significant experience in oncology and immunotherapy. As such, we plan to continue to leverage the collective talent of our scientists, clinicians and a network of highly influential advisors to inform our development strategy and enable our technology to be at the forefront of immunotherapy. We strive to protect our commercially important discoveries and product candidates by applying for, maintaining and defending our patent rights.

The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance. Ongoing advancements reported in numerous leading scientific journals have generated significant interest and rationale for targeting the STING receptor as a novel therapeutic approach to immuno-oncology. We are developing a portfolio of synthetic proprietary small molecule immune modulators that target and activate the STING receptor with application across diverse diseases. The STING receptor is generally expressed at high levels in immune cells, including dendritic cells, or DCs, that are critical for tumor antigen-presentation, and many other cells in the body. Once activated, the STING receptor initiates a profound innate immune response, inducing the expression of a broad profile of cytokines, including interferons and chemokines. In addition to this cytokine profile, the enhanced tumor antigen-presenting capacity subsequently has been demonstrated in preclinical models to lead to the development of an effective tumor antigen-specific T cell adaptive immune response.
 Natural ligands for STING occur in cells as cyclic dinucleotides, or CDNs, either produced by bacteria infecting a host cell or by mammalian cells through the upstream enzyme, cGAS, upon sensing the presence of double-stranded (ds) DNA in the cytosol. Endogenously produced CDNs, including 2’,3’ cGAMP, bind with high affinity and activate all known human allelic variant STING proteins. We are advancing through development novel synthetic STING pathway product candidates with further improved properties that potently activate all STING proteins. 
 


STING Pathway Activator Product Candidates 
 We envision multiple STING pathway product opportunities, particularly in combination with other treatments. In preclinical animal models, our data have shown that our proprietary STING pathway activator product candidates can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors such as those targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, and conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
 ADU-S100 
 Our lead STING pathway product candidate is ADU-S100 (also known as MIW815), which differs from naturally occurring CDNs through the provision of proprietary modifications designed to optimize stability, STING receptor binding affinity and potency, without significant toxicity. In March 2015, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with Novartis to further advance the research and development of STING pathway product candidates in oncology.

ADU-S100 Preclinical Studies 
 In preclinical mouse tumor models, intratumoral (IT) injection of ADU-S100 induced tumor shrinkage and generated substantial immune responses capable of providing long-lasting systemic antigen-specific T cell immunity to prevent further growth of distal, untreated tumor metastases, sometimes referred to as an abscopal effect. Preclinical tumor therapy experiments using ADU-S100 via intratumoral injection indicate that in addition to the production of IFN-β, activation of CD8+ T cell responses is a hallmark of successful STING pathway activator therapy leading to immune-mediated rejection of injected and distant tumors and long-term and systemic immunity. We therefore believe ADU-S100 has the potential to bridge innate to adaptive immunity in tumors that are not otherwise rejected. 
 ADU-S100 directly activates natural killer cells and could potentially enhance Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, or ADCC, representing an important mechanism of action of several established monoclonal antibody cancer therapies. Therefore, another opportunity could be to conjugate our STING pathway activator product candidates to enhance ADCC. 
 We are advancing development of ADU-S100 in clinical trials designed to further assess its potential. 
 Head and Neck Cancer Overview
 Cancers that are known collectively as head and neck cancers often begin in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck, including the oral cavity, larynx, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, thyroid and salivary glands. These squamous cell cancers are often referred to as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN. The symptoms of head and neck cancers may include a lump or a sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, difficulty in swallowing and a change or hoarseness in the voice. SCCHN accounts for over 90 percent of head and neck cancers and is the sixth most common cancer by incidence worldwide. Each year, SCCHN is diagnosed in more than 600,000 people globally, with 50,000 new cases and more than 10,000 deaths occurring in the United States alone. Rates of death due to SCCHN have declined only slightly in the United States over the past three decades, and the all-stage survival rates of 61 percent at five years and 50 percent at 10 years illustrate the need for improved therapy.
 
Phase 2 ADU-S100 in Combination with anti-PD-1 antibody in SCCHN (Ongoing)
 In September 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of ADU-S100 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an approved anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, as first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. The Phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADU-S100 (MIW815) administered intratumorally in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting. The planned population will consist of 34 adults with PD-L1 positive recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.
 Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Overview
 Globally, bladder cancer accounts for approximately 390,000 cases and 150,000 deaths each year. In developed areas of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, these bladder cancers are predominantly urothelial. Approximately 70 percent of new urothelial bladder cancer cases are classified as non-muscle invasive. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC, includes Ta (papillary), T1 (submucosal invasive) tumors, and Tis (carcinoma in situ), which account for approximately 70, 20, and 10 percent of non-muscle invasive cancers, respectively. NMIBC is a local, superficial disease in which ablation of the tumor may be sufficient to control the disease. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most commonly used agent for intravesical therapy. The American Urological Association (AUA), American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU), Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN), Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), the Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA) and the Urology Care Foundation (UCF) remain concerned about a global shortage of BCG and its effects on the care of bladder cancer patients. The global shortage of BCG due to the growing use and need for this product around the world is a significant issue, and additional treatment options are needed.
 Scientific Rationale for Preclinical Studies of ADU-S100 in NMIBC
 ADU-S100 is a small molecule with potential to induce a local innate immune response in patients with NMIBC. Patients who are unresponsive to BCG have a tumor microenvironment enriched with ADU-S100 targets. In addition, mechanisms leading to a BCG-refractory state may not interfere with a response to ADU-S100. As a result, there is potential for a single agent therapeutic application of ADU-S100 in patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC. Given intravesical administration is the current standard of care, it is an attractive alternative to systemic delivery. BCG-refractory patients constitute a high unmet medical need recognized by the FDA with an approval pathway outlined in guidance from February 2018.
 7

In preclinical models, ADU-S100 activates an immune response in the bladder after intravesicular delivery and controls tumors. We have demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor efficacy in the standard orthotopic model (MB49 bladder tumor). Local cytokine induction was observed with intravesicular delivery of ADU-S100.
 We are preparing to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of ADU-S100 as a single agent administered intravesically in patients with NMIBC who are unresponsive to BCG in the second half of 2020. 
 Systemic STING Agonists
 We continue to jointly pursue STING pathway activation through systemic delivery as a therapeutic strategy under our collaboration and license agreement with Novartis.
 cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor Program 
 We are also pursuing product opportunities that inhibit or antagonize the STING pathway. According to recent publications, over-production of type I IFN has been linked to the pathophysiology of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, genetic mutations found in proteins regulating the STING pathway were linked to certain inflammatory diseases, including severe childhood inflammatory syndromes. 
 Our cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor product candidates are small molecules that are being designed to bind and block the pathway to reduce excessive type I interferon production that drive certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These small molecules originate from several high throughput screens and are further optimized to impart adequate potency and systemic bioavailability. We believe these product candidates may have broad application in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In December 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly for our cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor program for the research and development of novel product candidates for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.
 APRIL Pathway Technology
 We believe key attributes of our APRIL pathway technology include:
  
• | Early Evidence of Potency. BION-1301, a humanized antibody that blocks APRIL from binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors, has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce serum IgA levels in mice and monkeys, demonstrating compelling rationale for its use in IgA nephropathy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel Mechanism. Blocking APRIL is a distinct approach to inhibit its activity on both the BCMA and TACI receptors that appears to have immunomodulatory properties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatility. APRIL is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple indications including IgA nephropathy and other diseases that involve plasma cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Manufacture. BION-1301 is a biologic that can be manufactured through well-established processes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Applicability. BION-1301 is a monoclonal antibody, an established therapeutic class to treat cancer as well as autoimmune diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patients with IgA nephropathy have significantly higher levels of APRIL than healthy controls, and higher APRIL levels in these patients correlates with poor prognosis in the form of increased galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A (Gd-IgA), increased proteinuria and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Gd-IgA is recognized as a critical autoantigen to which IgA nephropathy patients develop autoantibodies, resulting in the formation and deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys, which ultimately causes local inflammation and functional damage. We know from published literature that APRIL is a soluble factor that functions via binding to the BCMA and TACI receptors, and that APRIL critically drives IgA class switching through TACI and survival of IgA-producing plasma cells through BCMA. Our experiments demonstrate that blocking APRIL inhibits the survival and immunoglobulin production of human plasma cells. We have also demonstrated that IgA-producing plasma cells are more sensitive to immunomodulation by BION-1301, possibly due to their enhanced expression of TACI and BCMA. BION-1301 also downregulates IgG- and IgM-producing plasma cells, which is critical because autoantibodies targeting Gd-IgA can be of all Ig classes. Blocking APRIL is a distinct approach to potentially downmodulate two key processes in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy: reducing circulating levels of IgA, Gd-IgA and anti-Gd-IgA autoantibodies as well as immune complex formation. We believe BION-1301 represents the first potential disease-modifying treatment for IgA nephropathy.

APRIL Product Candidates
 BION-1301
 BION-1301 is a first-in-class, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that fully blocks APRIL binding to both the BCMA and TACI receptors and is being developed as a novel therapy for IgA nephropathy. 
 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that BION-1301 binds to a specifically defined epitope on APRIL, resulting in complete blockade of APRIL-induced receptor activation. Dosing of BION-1301 in non-human primates led to a significant reduction of blood IgA levels and established a favorable safety profile. Additional preclinical studies demonstrated that hAPRIL transgenic mice produce rising levels of IgA as well as IgA deposits in the kidney. Administration of mouse anti-human APRIL was shown to reduce levels of IgA in both the serum and the kidney. In patients with IgA nephropathy, BION-1301 has the potential to neutralize APRIL, inhibit secretion of Gd-IgA, and thereby reduce immune complex formation and kidney deposition. BION-1301 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial.
 
IgA Nephropathy Overview
 IgA nephropathy is a chronic autoimmune kidney disease characterized by the accumulation of autoantibodies binding to Gd-IgA, ultimately leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli of the kidneys. This results in inflammation that damages the glomeruli, causing proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. As the disease advances, patients with IgA nephropathy may require dialysis or kidney transplantation. There is no available treatment to reduce production of Gd-IgA associated with IgA nephropathy. 
 9

Up to approximately 50 percent of patients with IgA nephropathy progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 20 years. No cure currently exists for IgA nephropathy and treatments are targeted towards preventing progression to ESRD and alleviating symptoms. IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary chronic glomerular disease worldwide. While prevalence varies geographically, biopsy and dialysis registry data suggest a higher incidence of IgA nephropathy in East Asian populations and lower incidence in African populations. Variations in disease prevalence may reflect regional differences in screening for kidney disease and kidney biopsy practices. Many patients with IgA nephropathy are detected on routine urine screening because their only clinical manifestation is asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria. Prevalence may therefore appear to be higher in countries with an active urine testing program and a low threshold for the performance of renal biopsy in patients with isolated asymptomatic hematuria, such as Japan and Korea, where testing is routinely performed in schools and in the workplace. Conversely, clinicians in North America seldom biopsy a patient with isolated hematuria or mild proteinuria, resulting in an apparently lower disease prevalence.
 

Phase 1 BION 1301 in IgA Nephropathy (Ongoing)
 In the first half of 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of BION-1301 in IgA nephropathy in healthy volunteers. As part of this study protocol, we will begin dosing IgA nephropathy patients in the first half of 2020. The primary objectives of this clinical trial are to: 
  
• | Assess the safety profile of BION-1301 in healthy volunteers and IgA nephropathy patients,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Determine the PK/PD relationship in healthy volunteers and IgA nephropathy patients, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish proof-of-mechanism: reduction in IgA in healthy volunteers and/or a reduction in Gd-IgA in IgA nephropathy patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Programs
 Anti-CD27 Agonist
 CD27 is a co-stimulatory receptor expressed on different immune cells, such as T-lymphocytes and NK (natural killer) cells. It has been recognized as having an important role in priming, enhancing and sustaining a productive anti-cancer (CD8+ T-cell) adaptive 
 10

immune response. In preclinical studies, anti-CD27 activation was shown to enhance T-cell response, which in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition demonstrated the ability to achieve complete tumor eradication. 
 In 2014, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Merck for the development and commercialization of anti-CD27 agonists, including MK-5890, which was identified with our proprietary B-select monoclonal antibody technology. MK-5890 is a humanized agonist monoclonal antibody that binds to CD27 to provide a costimulatory signal that enhances T-cell-mediated responses. MK-5890 is currently being evaluated by Merck in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and in a Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous NSCLC that have been previously treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy.
 
Manufacturing
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We have established manufacturing processes and supply and quality agreements for all of the investigational agents used in our ongoing clinical trials. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We may continue to rely on CMOs to manufacture our products for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights.
STING Pathway Activator Product Candidates 
 Manufacturing of our STING Activator product candidates generally encompasses both the chemical synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and its formulation and fill/finish of the final product. The synthetic process for the manufacture of our STING Activator product candidates is a trade secret and we retain control and ownership of the process. We have contracts with a CMO to produce, release and stability test the ADU-S100 API and drug product. Under our collaboration agreement with Novartis, Novartis has manufacturing rights for the manufacture of ADU-S100.
APRIL Pathway Candidates 
 Manufacturing of B-select product candidates includes generation of engineered cell lines that express and secrete the antibody product candidates. After selection of clones that secrete the desired amounts of product candidates, cell banks are generated and stored to preserve identity and characteristics. Process development, upstream and downstream, is undertaken to select optimal conditions for growth and productivity, quality standards and yield. In addition, activities are undertaken to identify formulation composition to establish stability characteristics. We contract with a CMO to develop, produce and release drug substance and drug product for our antibody candidates targeting APRIL and CTLA-4. 
Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on protections afforded through data exclusively, patent term extensions and regulatory exclusivity, where available. 
 Through licensing and through developing our own portfolio, we have rights to more than 150 issued patents and more than 250 pending applications in the United States and foreign countries. Patent families within the portfolio are directed to our STING and APRIL technologies as well as our other non-core programs. 
 STING Pathway Technology
 We own and license families of patents and patent applications directed to our STING pathway product candidates, which expire, or if issued would expire, between 2025 and 2040. In particular, we own four issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications, including corresponding foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, two priority filings, and four international filings directed to stereochemically pure cyclic purine dinucleotides and certain other substituted cyclic purine dinucleotides, and uses and derivatives thereof, which if issued would expire between 2033 and 2040, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. or foreign laws and assuming continued payment of any applicable fees. Within this portfolio are U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to compositions and methods for activating STING utilizing our STING pathway product candidates that are jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California, and which, if issued, would expire in 2034, and U.S., International and foreign patent applications directed to certain cyclic purine dinucleotides, and uses and derivatives thereof, that are jointly owned with Novartis, which, if issued, would expire in between 2036 and 2039. We also license a family of patents from Karagen Pharmaceuticals directed to certain STING pathway molecules and their use in modulating immune response in a patient, which expire in 2025, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. laws and assuming continued payment of any applicable fees; a family of patents from the Regents of the University of California also directed to certain STING pathway molecules and their uses that, if issued, would expire in 2034; and a family of patents from a consortium of universities led by Memorial Sloan Kettering also directed to certain STING pathway molecules and their uses, with three issued U.S. 
 11

patents, one pending U.S. patent application and corresponding foreign issued patents and pending patent applications that, if issued, would expire in 2034.
Antibody Product Candidates
 We own seven issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, including corresponding foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, and one International filing to cover our antibody product candidates and use thereof. The issued U.S. patents that we own expire between 2030 and 2037, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. laws. Regarding the pending patent applications, if these claims were to be issued, they would expire between 2034 and 2040.
cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor Program 
 We own two issued U.S. patents and corresponding issued foreign patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and three International filings to cover our cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor product candidates and use thereof. The issued U.S. and foreign patents that we own expire in 2034, not including any patent term extensions that may be available under U.S. and foreign laws. Regarding the pending patent applications, if these claims were to be issued, they would expire in 2038 or 2039.
General Considerations 
 As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our product candidates will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims that cover such product candidates and their intended methods of use, and enforcing those claims once granted. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 
 Certain of our product candidates may be subject to The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA.  The BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The BPCIA is complex and is still in the process of being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact and implementation are subject to uncertainty.
 Many biopharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion, we may be subject to patent litigation. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court or tribunal declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome can be favorable or unfavorable. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with some of our consultants that require them to assign to us any inventions created as a result of their working with us. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Our commercial success will depend in part upon not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or our licensee(s) to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If a third party commences a patent infringement action against us, or our licensee(s), it could consume significant financial and management resources, regardless of the merit of the claims or the outcome of the litigation. 
 12

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. It is possible that these agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Collaborations 
 Novartis Agreement
 In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, pursuant to which we are collaborating worldwide with Novartis regarding the development and commercialization of product candidates containing an agonist of the molecular target known as STING in the field of oncology, including immuno-oncology and cancer vaccines. Under this agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis a co-exclusive license to develop such products worldwide, an exclusive license to commercialize such products outside the United States and a non-exclusive license to support us in commercializing such products in the United States if we request such support. The collaboration is guided by a joint steering committee with each party having final decision making authority regarding specified areas of development or commercialization.
 Under the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million from Novartis in April 2015. In 2016, we earned a $35.0 million development milestone upon initiation of a Phase 1 trial for the first STING product candidate, ADU-S100. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $215.0 million in development milestones and up to an additional $250.0 million in regulatory approval milestones. 
 We are responsible for 38% of the joint development costs worldwide and Novartis is responsible for the remaining 62% of the joint development costs worldwide; provided that under the agreement either party may opt out of early stage clinical trials subject to an obligation to fund and participate in any pivotal trials and reimburse certain early development costs if development of the product progresses into pivotal trials.
We will also receive 50% of gross profits on sales of any products commercialized pursuant to this collaboration in the United States and 45% of gross profits for specified European countries and Japan. For each of these profit share countries, each party will be responsible for its respective commercial sharing percentage of all joint commercialization costs incurred in that country.
 For all other countries where we are not sharing profits, Novartis will be responsible for all commercialization costs and will pay us a royalty in the mid-teens on all net sales of product sold by Novartis, its affiliates and sublicensees, with such percentage subject to reduction post patent and data exclusivity expiration and subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for royalties payable to third party licensors. Novartis’ royalty obligation will run on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration of the last valid claim covering the product, expiration of data exclusivity for the product or 12 years after first commercial sale of the product in such country.
 With respect to the United States, specified European countries and/or Japan, we may elect for such region to either reduce by 50% or to eliminate in our development and commercialization cost sharing obligation. If we elect to reduce our cost sharing percentage by 50% in any such region, then our profit share in such region will also be reduced by 50%. If we elect to eliminate our development cost sharing obligation, then such region will be removed from the profit share, and instead Novartis will owe us royalties on any net sales of product for such region, as described above.
 
In December 2019, Novartis removed ADU-S100 (MIW815), from its portfolio based on clinical data generated to date. This decision was not the result of any safety concern. Novartis has begun winding down the ongoing Phase 1b dose escalation clinical trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ADU-S100 in combination with spartalizumab (PDR001), Novartis’ investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in advanced, metastatic treatment-refractory solid tumors or lymphomas, and no dose expansion cohorts will be opened. Novartis is also terminating enrollment of the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial arm evaluating ADU-S100 in relapsed and refractory melanoma in combination with YERVOY® (ipilimumab), an approved anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Per protocol, patients currently enrolled or consented in these trials will remain on treatment until progression or toxicity.  The SCCHN and NMIBC studies evaluating ADU-S100 are being solely funded by Aduro. Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement, if Novartis opts out of funding an early stage clinical trial and the product progresses into a pivotal clinical trial, then Novartis would be required to fund and participate in the pivotal clinical trial, and Novartis may have certain reimbursement obligations for prior development expenses for the early stage clinical trial.

The collaboration and license agreement between Novartis and Aduro remains in effect, and both parties continue to jointly pursue STING pathway activation through systemic delivery as a therapeutic strategy.
 
Lilly Agreement
 On December 18, 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Lilly for our cGAS-STING Pathway Inhibitor program for the research and development of novel immunotherapies for autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. Pursuant to this agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, we granted an exclusive and worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by us to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain cGAS-STING products for the treatment of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. The license granted is sublicensable during a specified time period. 
 Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2019 and will be eligible for development and commercial milestones of up to approximately $620.0 million per product. Lilly is also obligated to pay us tiered royalty payments at percentages in the single to low-double digits based on annual net sales of the licensed products. Lilly must pay such royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of certain patents, (ii) the expiration of the data exclusivity period in such country or (iii) a specified anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. We will be reimbursed for up to a certain amount of research funding spent during the research term. In addition, we have the option to co-fund the clinical development of each product in exchange for an increase in royalty payments and a reduction in certain milestone payments to the extent relevant to such co-funded product. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization.
 The Lilly Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations and may be terminated by Lilly following specified notice period, or by either party in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or bankruptcy of the other party.
 Merck Agreement
 In connection with the acquisition of Aduro Biotech Europe Holdings, Europe B.V., or Aduro Biotech Europe, in October 2015, we became party to an Exclusive Patent and Know How License and Research Collaboration Agreement with Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck, pursuant to which we have exclusively licensed our anti-CD27 antibody to Merck. This agreement, or the Merck Agreement, sets forth the parties’ respective obligations for development, and commercialization of certain antibody product candidates.
 Since the execution of the Merck Agreement, we have received $5.0 million in connection with achievement of development milestones for our anti-CD27 antibody. In February 2020, we earned an additional $10 million development milestone payment for the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of anti-CD27 antibody (Note 16). Under the Merck Agreement we are eligible to receive future contingent payments, including up to $297.0 million in potential development milestone payments, and up to $135.0 million in commercial and net sales milestones for a product candidate. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties in the mid-single digits to low teens based on net sales of the product.
 
Our Research and Development and License Agreements
 STING Pathway License Agreements 
 Karagen Agreement 
 In June 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Karagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Karagen, pursuant to which Karagen granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicenseable license under certain patents and know-how related to STING pathway technologies to make, develop, use and commercialize products for use in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of cancer or precancerous conditions and a non-exclusive license to such patents and know-how to make, develop, use and commercialize products for all other uses. Under the agreement, or the Karagen Agreement, we were also granted an option to designate a particular disease or condition to be added to the field of use under our exclusive license. Under the Karagen Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the United States and the European Union. 
 14

Under the Karagen Agreement, we are required to make milestone payments totaling up to $900,000, in aggregate, for the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones as well as royalties based on net sales of products by us, our affiliates and sublicensees at rates ranging in the low single-digit percentages, determined by whether the disease field is an exclusive or non-exclusive disease field, subject to minimum annual royalties and standard reductions. In addition, we are required to pay Karagen a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teen digits determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time of the sublicense grant, or by whether we have exercised our option to add a designated field of use to its exclusive license, as applicable. 
 The Karagen Agreement will expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. Either party may terminate the Karagen Agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event of the other party’s material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period, and immediately upon notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Additionally, we may terminate the Karagen Agreement at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice to Karagen. 
 UCB Vance Agreement 
 In September 2014, we entered into a license agreement with UC Berkeley, or UCB, granting us an exclusive, worldwide sublicenseable license under certain patent rights covering the use of the STING Activator molecules that activate the STING receptor to make, develop, use and commercialize products, to practice methods and to offer services, in each case that are covered by the licensed patent rights, in all fields of use. Under this agreement, or the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and sell licensed products and services and are obligated to achieve specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. 
 Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we paid UCB an upfront fee of $50,000 in 2014 and are required to make future milestone payments totaling up to $1.5 million, in the aggregate, upon our achievement of certain specified development and regulatory milestones for the first indication and up to $250,000 upon our achievement of a specified development and regulatory milestone for each additional indication developed. Under the UCB Vance Agreement, we are obligated to pay UCB royalties based on net sales of licensed products and services sold by us and our sublicensees at a rate in the low single-digit percentages, subject to minimum annual royalties and customary reductions, and a percentage of consideration received from any sublicensing arrangements at rates ranging from the low-single digits to the low thirties, determined by the current stage of development of the relevant licensed product at the time the sublicense is granted. 
 The UCB Vance Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights. UCB may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event of our material breach that is not cured within such 90-day period. We may terminate the agreement at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice. UCB may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ advance written notice in the event we challenge the validity or unenforceability of any licensed patent. 
 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Agreement 
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSK, The Rockefeller University, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and University of Bonn, collectively the Licensors, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents related to STING Activators and a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under specified know-how, in each case to develop, make, have made, use, have used, import, sell, and otherwise commercialize licensed products for use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in humans. Under the agreement, or the MSK Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product, including achieving specified development and regulatory milestones by specified dates. In May and October 2016, the parties amended the license to further expand its scope, which now covers all products covered by the licensed intellectual property.
 Under the MSK Agreement, we paid MSK upfront fees of $50,000 in 2015 and an additional $2.0 million in 2016 in connection with the second amendment of the MSK Agreement. Under the amended MSK Agreement we are required to pay MSK development and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $875,000 for each licensed product and commercialization milestone payments totaling up to $4.5 million for each licensed product. We are also required to pay MSK royalties based on net sales of licensed products by us and our sublicensees at a rate ranging in the low single digits depending on whether the licensed product is covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to minimum annual royalties. Our royalty obligation to MSK continues on a country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last patent right covering the licensed product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale in such country. We are also obligated to pay MSK a percentage of certain consideration received for the grant of sublicenses, ranging from ten to the mid-twenties. 
 15

The MSK Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations. Either party may terminate the MSK Agreement upon the other party’s uncured material breach that is not cured within 90 days after the breaching party receives notice of such breach. Additionally, the Licensors may terminate the MSK Agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we fail to pay any undisputed amounts owed under the agreement and do not cure such failure within 30 days after receiving notice of such failure.
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. A wide variety of institutions, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapy products.  
 Our competitors in the STING pathway activator technology include Merck & Co., Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company/IFM Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Synlogic, Inc., Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Codiak Biosciences, Inc., Eisai, Co., Ltd./H3 Biomedicine, Inc., AbbVie (following its acquisition of Mavupharma), Curadev, Trillium Therapeutics Inc., Mersana Therapeutics, Stingray Therapeutics, Ryvu Therapeutics, Cancer Therapeutics CRC, ImmuneSensor Therapeutics, Nimbus Therapeutics and STINGINN LLC. Our competitors for the anti-APRIL program include Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (following its acquisition of Visterra, Inc.) and Merck KGaA (EMD Serono). Our competitors for the cGAS-STING pathway inhibitor program include Pfizer Inc., Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Curadev, Sirenas, LLC, Nimbus Therapeutics/Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, IFM Due (a subsidiary of IFM Therapeutics, LLC), AbbVie (following its acquisition of Mavupharma), ImmuneSensor Therapeutics and STINGINN LLC. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States and the Netherlands, we are subject to extensive regulation. Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 16

U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with commercial development of combination immuno-oncology products. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for any biologic or a new drug application, or NDA, for any drug we seek to market that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency, or safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control (except in the cases of Sponsor-Investigator studies). Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 17

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gather additional information about a product's safety, efficacy or optimal use. Some of the studies may be required under statue or regulation; others may be trials a sponsor has committed to conduct. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Quarterly safety reporting is required for marketed products for the first three years after approval. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials (for INDs) and changes to the application (for marketed products) must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events that are considered related to study drug, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening adverse reaction that is considered related to study drug within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immuno-oncology trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA or NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA or NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 18

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA may be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA or NDA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer significant improvements in safety or efficacy, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and in the case of an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological or drug products or biological or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA or NDA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA or NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 
 Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 19

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any indications or for any product candidates. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA or NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA or NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA or NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA or NDA. 
 Any product, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation is available for product candidates that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both Fast Track designation and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, FDA will work closely with the sponsor to expedite the development and review of such product.

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. 
 Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct certain pediatric clinical investigations of the product.
 21

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may choose to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
 22

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” made to such physician owners. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 23

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act. 
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24

 
• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court's decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how these decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act (or other similar legislation) on our business remains unclear.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business, though we are still unsure what its full impact will be. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenue potential and results. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Additional Regulation 
 In addition, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. State and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, also affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances 
 25

used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 Europe and Rest of World Government Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 96 full-time employees, 74 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 22 of whom were engaged in finance, business development, facilities, human resources and administrative support. As of December 31, 2019, of our full-time employees, 26 hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
