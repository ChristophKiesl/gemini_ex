ZEJULA (Niraparib) 
 ZEJULA is a once-daily small-molecule poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2, or PARP 1/2, inhibitor. A PARP inhibitor blocks the ability of cancer cells to repair themselves after they have been damaged by radiation and certain chemotherapies. This inhibition of DNA damage repair can result in both the inability of cancer cells to replicate themselves and in programmed cell death. 
 In September 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Tesaro Inc. (a company later acquired by GSK) to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in China, Hong Kong and Macau. We have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in the licensed territories for all potential indications except prostate cancer. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—GSK.” 
 ZEJULA was first approved in March 2017 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who exhibit a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, in 2019, the FDA approved ZEJULA for treatment of patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive status, and in 2020 approved it as a monotherapy first-line maintenance treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved ZEJULA in November 2017 as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete response or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, ZEJULA was approved by the EMA in October 2020 as first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy, platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status.
As maintenance therapy, ZEJULA is for women who have had prior chemotherapy treatment, but are expected to see their cancer return. ZEJULA is intended to avoid or slow a recurrence of the cancer if it is in 
 
-2- 

    remission after prior treatment. A platinum-sensitive cancer is one that responded to initial platinum-based chemotherapy and remained in remission post-chemotherapy for more than six months. 
 Market Opportunity and Competition 
 We launched ZEJULA in Hong Kong in December 2018 for adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer who are in a complete response or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy after approval by the Hong Kong Department of Health. ZEJULA was approved and launched in Macau in June 2019. We launched ZEJULA in China in January 2020 after approval in December 2019 by the NMPA as a second-line maintenance treatment for women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In September 2020, ZEJULA was approved by the NMPA as a maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. ZEJULA is the only PARP inhibitor approved by the FDA, the EMA and the NMPA for first-and second-line maintenance treatment for women with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status, such as BRCA mutations. 
 In May 2020, ZEJULA was recommended as a monotherapy first-line maintenance treatment for women with platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer in the Ovarian Cancer PARP Inhibitor Clinical Guidelines published by Gynecological Oncology, Chinese Medical Association. In December 2020, ZEJULA was included in the updated National Reimbursement Drug List or the NRDL. As of January 31, 2021, ZEJULA was listed in 67 commercial health insurance plans and 44 supplemental insurance plans managed by municipal governments throughout China. Enrollment into this regional reimbursement program has improved and will improve access to ZEJULA for many patients in need across China. 
 We intend to pursue the approval and registration of ZEJULA for treatment across multiple solid tumor types in China, Hong Kong and Macau. We are also exploring the use of ZEJULA in multiple combination and monotherapy treatment options. In February 2020, we dosed the first patient in China in an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase Ib dose escalation and expansion clinical study to assess the safety and antitumor activity of tebotelimab in combination with ZEJULA for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (collectively as gastric cancer) who failed prior treatment. The primary endpoints of the study are to assess the safety of ZEJULA in combination with tebotelimab in patients with advanced gastric cancer and to determine the recommended Phase II dose. We expect to complete patient enrollment by the end of 2021. 
 Optune (Tumor Treating Fields) 
 Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is a cancer treatment that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cancer cell division. TTFields therapy is delivered through a portable medical device. The complete delivery system, called Optune or Optune Lua, includes a portable electric field generator, arrays, rechargeable batteries and accessories. Sterile, single-use arrays are placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor and connected to the electric field generator to deliver therapy. Arrays are changed when hair growth or the hydrogel reduces array adhesion to the skin. The therapy is designed to be delivered continuously throughout the day and night, and efficacy is strongly correlated to time on therapy. When the device is turned on, TTFields are continuously generated within the specific region of the body covered by the arrays. Healthy tissues located outside of this region remain unaffected by the therapy. 
 In 2015, Optune was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), a chemotherapy drug, and for adult patients with GBM following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy as monotherapy treatment. Optune is also approved or has a CE certificate for the treatment of GBM in the European Union, Japan and certain other countries. 
 In September 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novocure to develop and commercialize Optune in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventative uses in the field of oncology. 
 
-3- 

   For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Novocure.” We launched Optune in Hong Kong in 2018 and in China in June 2020 after the NMPA approved Optune in May 2020 in combination with temozolomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM and also as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. 
 Market Opportunity and Competition 
 GBM, a malignant form of astrocytoma, is the most aggressive form of brain cancer. In China, GBM represents about 47% of all newly diagnosed cases of brain cancer, with an estimated annual incidence of 53,600 patients in 2019. GBM is treated mainly by surgery, radiotherapy and temozolomide. Despite these treatments, prospects for long-term survival remains poor. In China, the five-year survival rate of GBM patients is less than 5%. Optune is the first treatment approved by the NMPA for GBM in China since 2007. 
 In August 2020, in Hong Kong, we launched Optune Lua, a portable medical device that delivers TTFields for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). MPM is a type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue in the torso covering internal organs. In May 2019, Novocure received FDA approval for use of Optune Lua as a Humanitarian Use Device in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic MPM. For details about our clinical development of Tumor Treating Fields, see the subsection “Our Oncology Pipeline—Tumor Treating Fields.” 
 QINLOCK (ripretinib) 
 QINLOCK is an orally administered kinase switch control inhibitor. It is approved by the FDA for use in the United States to treat fourth-line advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), where significant unmet medical need exists. 
 In June 2019, we obtained an exclusive license from Deciphera to develop and commercialize QINLOCK in Greater China for the prevention, prophylaxis, treatment, cure or amelioration of any disease or medical condition in humans. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Deciphera.” In May 2020, the FDA approved QINLOCK for adult patients with GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We are exploring ripretinib for the treatment of GIST, the most common sarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract, which present most often in the stomach or small intestine. 
 In July 2020, the NMPA accepted the NDA submission of QINLOCK for fourth-line advanced GIST. That same month, QINLOCK was approved, pursuant to the special Named Patient Program (NPP), by the Health Commission and Medical Products Administration of Hainan Province as the first Urgently Needed Drug that can be taken from the Boao Pilot Zone by a designated patient. Under the NPP, patients may apply for permission to purchase a small amount of legally imported drugs that are not yet registered domestically (either inside or outside the Boao Pilot Zone) and which address urgent medical needs in the Boao Pilot Zone. 
 In August 2020, the NMPA granted Priority Review to the NDA submission for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received priority treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors. We have also received Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) approval for the registrational study of QINLOCK in patients with second-line GIST. This study is ongoing. 
 NUZYRA (omadacycline) 
 NUZYRA is a broad-spectrum antibiotic in a new class of tetracycline derivatives known as aminomethylcyclines. NUZYRA is primarily being developed by our partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or 
 
-4- 

   Paratek, for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) in both the hospital and community settings. In October 2018, NUZYRA was approved by the FDA for once-daily oral or intravenous administration for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI. Our partner, Paratek, launched NUZYRA in the United States in February 2019. 
 In April 2017, we obtained an exclusive license from Paratek to develop, manufacture and commercialize NUZYRA in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventive uses other than biodefense. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Paratek.” 
 Market Opportunity 
 The World Health Organization has identified the development of worldwide resistance to currently available antibacterial agents as one of the greatest threats to human health. We believe that NUZYRA’s potential use in multiple settings, including the emergency room, hospital and community care facilities, provides a significant benefit to patients as an empiric monotherapy. In 2015, the estimated incidence of ABSSSI and CABP in China was 2.8 million patients and 16.5 million patients, respectively. 
 We completed the technology transfer for NUZYRA in November 2017 to enable us to prepare for the manufacture of both oral tablets and intravenous injections of NUZYRA. 
 In February 2020, the NMPA accepted our NDA for NUZYRA for the treatment of CABP and ABSSSI. In May 2020, the NMPA granted Priority Review status for this NDA.

 Our Oncology Pipeline 
 ZEJULA 
 ZEJULA is a once-daily small-molecule poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2, or PARP 1/2, inhibitor. 
 
-6- 

  As discussed above, we have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in our licensed territories for all potential indications except prostate cancer pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with GSK. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—GSK.” 
 We continue to explore ZEJULA for patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in China. In February 2020, we dosed the first patient in a Phase I-b proof-of-concept China-only trial, in combination with tebotelimab (PD-1xLAG-3). We are also exploring the combination potential of ZEJULA with immuno-oncology therapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy in the clinically relevant indications. 
 Tumor Treating Fields 
 TTFields therapy is a cancer treatment that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cancer cell division. 
 As discussed above, we have an exclusive license from Novocure to develop and commercialize Optune in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventative uses in the field of oncology. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Novocure.” 
 Novocure continues to test TTFields against a broad range of solid tumor types. We intend to enroll patients in Greater China in the various global trials for TTFields. 
 In January 2020, we enrolled the first patient in a Phase II pilot clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of TTFields in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma, a type of gastric cancer. In 2015, gastric cancer was the second most common cancer and the second-leading cause of death in China, with 679,100 newly diagnosed cases and 498,000 deaths. Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and therefore has a very poor prognosis, with a five-year survival of only 35.9%. Current treatments of pancreatic cancer include surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, interventional therapy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography- (ERCP-) related treatment and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments. 
 We will also be participating in the PANOVA-3 Phase III pivotal trial of TTFields for pancreatic cancer. PANOVA-3 is a global, open-label, randomized Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of TTFields administered concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as front-line treatment for patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. According to the World Health Organization, pancreatic cancer was the ninth leading cancer type in China in 2020 with an estimated 124,994 newly diagnosed cases and 121,853 deaths. The current median survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is four to six months, and the five-year survival rate is 7.2%, making it the malignancy with the lowest survival rate in China. Current treatments of pancreatic cancer include surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, interventional therapy, ERCP-related treatment and TCM treatment. 
 We will also be participating in the Phase III pivotal LUNAR trial which is intended for patients who have recently been diagnosed with progression of NSCLC during or after platinum-based therapy. Lung cancer consists of NSCLC in approximately 85% of cases and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in approximately 15% of cases. Lung cancer has the highest total incidence of any cancer in China. According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of lung cancer in China in 2020 was 815,563 cases, with 714,699 deaths. In China, the five-year survival rate of lung cancer is estimated to be about 20%. 
 We are preparing to submit to the NMPA a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Optune Lua for MPM. 
 We are also participating in a clinical trial of TTFields that includes ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic cancers in China. Since early symptoms of ovarian cancer are not specific to 
 
-7- 

  the disease and are difficult to detect, approximately 70% of women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer when the disease is at an advanced stage, when prognosis is poor. Despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the front-line setting, approximately 85% of patients will experience disease recurrence. 
 QINLOCK (ripretinib) 
 QINLOCK is an orally administered kinase switch control inhibitor. We are developing QINLOCK for the treatment of GIST. In August 2020, the NMPA granted Priority Review of the NDA for QINLOCK for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors. We have also received the CTA approval for the registrational study of QINLOCK in patients with second-line GIST. The study is ongoing. 
 Odronextamab 
 Odronextamab is an investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to trigger tumor killing by linking and activating a cytotoxic T-cell (binding to CD3) to a lymphoma cell (binding to CD20). Odronextamab has demonstrated clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients with late stages of follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other lymphomas in a Phase I trial and is currently being investigated in a potentially registrational Phase II program. 
 In April 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Regeneron Ireland Designated Activity Company, an affiliate of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, pursuant to which we obtained the development rights and exclusive commercialization rights to odronextamab for oncology in Greater China. For further details of this collaboration , see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Regeneron.” In December 2020, Regeneron has announced that it is pausing new enrollment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas in its trials for odronextamab in compliance with an FDA partial clinical hold requesting that Regeneron amend the trial protocols in order to further reduce the incidence of ³Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during step-up dosing. Currently enrolled patients who are deriving clinical benefit from odronextamab may continue treatment following re-consent.
We have received CTA approval in China for and plan to join the open-label, multi-center, global, potentially registrational Phase II program evaluating the efficacy and safety of odronextamab in several disease-specific cohorts, including patients with R/R FL, DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and other B-NHL subtypes. 
 Repotrectinib 
 Repotrectinib is an investigational next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to effectively target ROS1 and TRK A/B/C in TKI-naïve- or -pretreated cancer patients. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the development of repotrectinib in NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology, Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI-naïve) and three Fast Track designations. 
 In July 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Turning Point Therapeutics or Turning Point, to develop and commercialize repotrectinib in Greater China in all human therapeutic indications. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Turning Point.” 
 Turning Point is currently evaluating repotrectinib in TRIDENT-1, an ongoing Phase I/II trial of repotrectinib in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. We have submitted a Phase II registrational CTA and we anticipate opening additional sites for the TRIDENT-1 Phase II registrational clinical study of repotrectinib in China. We plan to recruit patients in Greater China in the Phase II TRIDENT-1 study in the first half of 2021.

  MARGENZA™ (margetuximab-cmkb) 
 Margetuximab is an investigational, immune-enhancing monoclonal antibody that targets HER2-expressing tumors, including certain types of breast and gastroesophageal cancers. On December 16, 2020, the FDA approved MARGENZA for use in the United States, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. In June 2020, the FDA granted margetuximab an orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. 
 In November 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, the MacroGenics Agreement, with MacroGenics, Inc., or MacroGenics, to develop and commercialize MARGENZA in Greater China in all human fields of use. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—MacroGenics.” 
 We are exploring regulatory approval pathways for MARGENZA in HER2-positive breast cancer in China. In February 2020, the first patient was dosed in our registrational bridging study of MARGENZA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. During 2020 in China, there were approximately 416,370 newly diagnosed cases and approximately 117,175 deaths related to breast cancer. Approximately 20-25% of all breast cancer cases are HER2-positive breast cancer. 
 In September 2020, we enrolled the first patient in Greater China in MAHOGANY, the MacroGenics-sponsored Phase II/III global study of margetuximab in combination with retifanlimab, a PD-1 antibody, or tebotelimab, a PD-1 x LAG-3 bispecific DART molecule, with or without chemotherapy, as a potential first-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer. 
 Bemarituzumab 
 Bemarituzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1 isotype) specific to the human FGFR2b receptor that is in clinical development as a targeted therapy for gastric and GEJ cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. 
 In December 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Five Prime Therapeutics, or Five Prime, to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in Greater China for the treatment or prevention of any disease or condition in humans. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Five Prime.” 
 In March 2020, Five Prime announced the publication of results from its Phase I escalation and expansion study of bemarituzumab monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors and FGFR2b-selected gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. 
 We enrolled Chinese patients into Five Prime’s Phase II FIGHT trial to evaluate bemarituzumab plus mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy in patients with fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b-positive (FGFR2b+), non HER2 positive (non HER2+) advanced gastric and GEJ cancer. In November 2020, Five Prime reported that the full Phase II data for bemarituzumab met all three efficacy endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival and secondary endpoints of overall survival and overall response rate. In January 2021, Five Prime announced its plan to launch a Phase III trial for gastric cancer. 
 CLN-081
CLN-081 is an orally available small molecule designed as a next-generation, irreversible EGFR inhibitor in development by Cullinan Pearl for the treatment of patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC. 
 
-9- 

  In December 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Cullinan Pearl, a subsidiary of Cullinan Management, Inc., formerly Cullinan Oncology, LLC, for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of CLN-081 in Greater China in all uses in humans and animals. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Cullinan.” 
 Cullinan Pearl is currently conducting a Phase I/IIa dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating oral, twice-daily administration of various doses in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations that have had at least one prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy or another approved standard therapy. We anticipate that we will join the Cullinan Phase I/IIa study. 
 TPX-0022
TPX-0022 is an orally bioavailable multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with a novel three-dimensional macrocyclic structure that inhibits the MET, CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) and SRC kinases. 
 In January 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Turning Point to develop and commercialize TPX-0022 in Greater China. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Turning Point.” 
 Turning Point has enrolled patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) or gastric cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in its SHIELD-1 Phase I clinical trial of TPX-0022. We anticipate that we will join Turning Point’s registrational Phase II study. 
 Tebotelimab 
 Tebotelimab (previously known as MGD013) is an investigational, bispecific, tetravalent IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to independently or coordinately block PD-1 and LAG-3 checkpoint molecules to sustain or restore the function of exhausted T cells for the treatment of cancer. 
 In November 2018, we entered into the MacroGenics Agreement pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize tebotelimab in Greater China in all human fields of use except to the extent limited by any applicable third party agreement of MacroGenics. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—MacroGenics.” 
 We are currently enrolling patients in China in MAHOGANY, a MacroGenics-sponsored global Phase II/III clinical trial designed to evaluate margetuximab in combination with retifanlimab or tebotelimab, with or without chemotherapy, as a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic HER2+ GEJ cancer and gastric cancer. We are also working with MacroGenics to prepare for our participation in an ongoing global Phase I basket trial of tebotelimab sponsored by MacroGenics. 
 In April 2020, we initiated a study of tebotelimab in combination with brivanib, a compound that we in-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb, in a Phase I proof-of-concept China-only dose escalation and expansion trial in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The dose escalation phase to determine the recommended Phase II dose of tebotelimab as monotherapy and in combination with brivanib was completed. Preliminary results from this dose escalation phase were presented at the 2020 Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) annual meeting. In China, HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer. In 2020, according to the World Health Organization, there were approximately 410,038 newly diagnosed cases and 391,152 deaths related to liver cancer in China. The five-year survival rate of HCC in China is estimated to be 12.1%. Current treatments of HCC include surgery, localized treatments, hepatic artery chemoembolization, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. 
 
-10- 

  In November 2020, we enrolled the first patient in China in a Phase I proof of concept clinical trial in China of tebotelimab as second-line therapy for melanoma patients after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. During 2020 in China, there were approximately 7,700 newly diagnosed cases and approximately 4,100 deaths related to melanoma. 
 Retifanlimab 
 Retifanlimab is an investigational humanized, hinge-stabilized, IgG4k monoclonal antibody that inhibits interactions between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.
In July 2019, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, to develop and commercialize retifanlimab in Greater China in hematology and oncology. Incyte retains an option to assist in the promotion of retifanlimab. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Incyte.” 
 In 2017, Incyte entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with MacroGenics for global rights to retifanlimab. Retifanlimab monotherapy is being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for endometrial cancer with abnormalities in DNA repair (microsatellite instability high MSI-H) or mismatch repair phenotype ((dMMR), or POLE mutations), unresectable locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, and previously treated locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell anal carcinoma (SCAC). 
 In October 2020, the first patient in China was dosed in the global POD1UM-101 study evaluating retifanlimab in patients with MSI-H endometrial cancer that had progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy. In January 2021, Incyte announced that the FDA accepted Priority Review of Incyte’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for retifanlimab in patients with locally advance or metastatic SCAC that has progressed following platinum therapy. Retifanlimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is currently in Phase III for chemotherapy-naïve NSCLC and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic SCAC. In the second half of 2020, we enrolled the first patient in China in the Phase III NSCLC study. 
 ZL-2309 (Simurosertib) 
 Simurosertib is an orally active, selective and ATP-competitive cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) kinase inhibitor. In December 2020, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement (excluding Japan) with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to research, develop and commercialize simurosertib in all uses in humans or animals. 
 A Phase Ib dose escalation clinical trial of simurosertib was completed. Anti-cancer activity was observed in both pre-clinical and clinical data. Simurosertib is under investigation in clinical trial NCT03261947 (A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Activity of TAK-931 in Participants with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Other Advanced Solid Tumors). 
 ZL-1201 (CD 47) 
 ZL-1201 is a humanized, IgG4 monoclonal antibody engineered to reduce effector function that specifically targets CD-47. We made modifications to the antibody that may reduce the incidence of hemolysis seen with other agents in the class based on preclinical data. CD47 has recently emerged as a novel target for macrophage immune checkpoint inhibition and a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Our pipeline includes several assets, including a novel bi-specific T cell engager and checkpoint inhibitors that lend themselves to potential combination with a CD47-targeted therapeutic. The therapeutic potential of these ZL-1201 combinations will be assessed in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In June 2020, we had achieved initiated dosing of a Phase I clinical trial for ZL-1201. Depending on the results of this trial, we may proceed with a Phase II clinical trial in potentially promising indications.

  Our Autoimmune Disease Pipeline 
 Efgartigimod 
 Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce disease-causing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and block the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is widely expressed throughout the body and plays a central role in rescuing IgG antibodies from degradation. 
 In January 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with argenx BV, or argenx, to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in Greater China. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—argenx.” 
 In February 2020, argenx announced that it received Fast Track designation for efgartigimod from the FDA for gMG. In January 2021, argenx announced that it submitted a BLA for efgartigimod to the FDA for gMG. 
 ZL-1102 (IL-17)
ZL-1102 is a human nanobody targeting interleukin-17, or IL-17, with high affinity and avidity. It is a smaller molecule than other IL-17 antibodies, a characteristic that may enable it to penetrate the psoriatic skin barrier, thereby avoiding significant systemic exposure. In May 2018, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Crescendo Biologics Limited to develop, manufacture and commercialize CB001 Humabody, antibody VH domain therapeutic. 
 Principles for treating mild to moderate psoriasis are different from those for moderate to severe psoriasis. For mild to moderate psoriasis patients, topical treatment is often the first-line choice, and dermatologists tend to avoid systemic treatment. For moderate to severe patients, the use of systemic treatments is usually inevitable. Dermatologists tend to choose IL-17 monoclonal antibodies because they have consistently demonstrated lesion clearance relative to older therapeutics. While therapy with IL-17 antibodies can result in safety issues due to immunosuppression and labeling currently restricts their use to more severely affected patient populations, they are generally considered safer than other immunosuppression antibodies such as anti-TNF-alpha or anti-IL-12/23 antibodies. Traditionally, it was considered that IL-17 antibodies, like other large molecules, could not penetrate the skin so it was considered unlikely for an antibody to be effective when topically applied. Like other full-size monoclonal antibodies, current IL-17 antibodies must be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. 
 In July 2020, the first patient was dosed in the global Phase I study in Australia. ZL-1102 is being tested to determine whether it may provide a new treatment option for patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, providing the efficacy of IL-17 inhibition generally used in moderate to severe psoriasis while avoiding systemic exposure through a unique topical application. 
 Our Infectious Disease Pipeline 
 Sulbactam/Durlobactam 
 Sulbactam/durlobactam, or SUL-DUR, is a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic (sulbactam) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (durlobactam) for the treatment of serious infections caused by Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Acinetobacter is a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment, such as in soil and water. Acinetobacter baumannii, which accounts for most Acinetobacter infections in humans causes infections in the blood, the urinary tract, the lungs (pneumonia) and in wounds in other parts of the body. There are currently no effective antibiotics indicated for the treatment of MDR Acinetobacter infections. In September 2017, the FDA granted SUL-DUR Qualified Infectious Disease Product, Fast Track and Priority Review status for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections due to Acinetobacter.

  In April 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc., or Entasis, to develop and commercialize durlobactam in all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses in Greater China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. For further details of the exclusive license, see “Overview of Our Material License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Entasis.” 
 In 2019, Entasis initiated the ATTACK (Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin) Phase III pivotal clinical trial to evaluate SUL-DUR, a combination of its broad-spectrum ß—lactamase inhibitor, durlobactam (formerly, ETX2514), with sulbactam, for the treatment of patients with pneumonia and bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. In 2016, based on a national survey of over 1,300 hospitals in China, there were approximately 210,000 Acinetobacter baumannii infections. 
 In May 2020, the first patient in China was enrolled in the ATTACK clinical trial. We also completed a pharmacokinetic study in the fall of 2020 for SUL-DUR in China in normal healthy volunteers. 
 Internally Discovered and Internally Developed Product Candidates
We have assembled an integrated drug discovery and development team with extensive experience in discovery, translational medicine and preclinical and clinical development and who have been directly involved in the discovery and development of several innovative product candidates. We identify pre-clinical assets through both internal-discovery efforts and co-development collaboration with our business partners. Through these efforts over the past few years, we have advanced our internally-developed pipeline to include three product candidates that are currently in global Phase I development.

 We have the right to manufacture the licensed products for commercialization in the licensed territory. The agreement with Paratek Bermuda Ltd. will remain in effect until, on a region-by-region basis, the expiration of the royalty term and payment by us of all of our royalty payment obligations in such region, where the royalty term for a licensed product in a region continues until the later of (i) the abandonment, expiration or invalidation of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering the licensed product or (ii) the close of business of the eleventh (11th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such region. In addition, either party may terminate this agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, subject to a certain cure period, or for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience at any time, subject to a certain notice period. Paratek Bermuda Ltd. has the right to terminate the agreement if we or our affiliates or sublicensees challenge its patents.

We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon a certain notice period. BMS may also terminate the agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies and other know-how to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties. 
Patents 
 Patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights are important in the sector in which we operate. We consider on a case-by-case basis filing patent applications with a view to protecting certain innovative products, processes, and methods of treatment. We may also license or acquire rights to patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, academic partners or commercial companies which are of interest to us. For the internally developed product candidates, we identify patents through both self-development effort and joint-development through collaboration with business partners such as academic institutions.   As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent 
 
-22- 

  applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive or license in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of our patents and patent applications over third-party patents and patent applications. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 The term of a patent depends upon the laws of the country in which it is issued. In most jurisdictions that we principally operate in, a patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Under current China Patent Law, the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to inventions are effective for twenty years, and utility models and designs are effective for ten years from the date of application. The Fourth Amendment to the China Patent Law, expected to come into effect on June 1, 2021, will increase the term of patents relating to designs to fifteen years from the date of application. 
 The laws of each jurisdiction vary, and patent term adjustment or patent term extension may not be available in any or all jurisdictions in which we own or license patents. 
 The following describes representative patents and/or pending applications related to our product candidates.

We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. If any of the partners, collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements or otherwise discloses our proprietary information, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose 
 
-26- 

  our trade secrets as a result. For more information regarding the risks related to our trade secrets, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property—If we are unable to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.” 
 Trademarks and domain names 
 We conduct our business using trademarks with various forms of the “ZAI LAB” and “再鼎医药” brands, as well as domain names incorporating some or all of these trademarks. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We believe research and development is important to our future growth and our ability to remain competitive. We are dedicated to discovering or licensing, and developing and commercializing proprietary therapeutics that addresses areas of large unmet medical need in the Greater China and global markets, including in the fields of oncology and infectious and autoimmune diseases. 
 We have built an integrated product discovery and development platform that aims to bring both in-licensed and internally-discovered medicines to patients in Greater China and globally. We have assembled an in-house research and development team with over 400 dedicated personnel who have extensive experience from discovery, translational medicine to late stage development. Our in-house research and development team had previously been directly involved in the discovery and development of several innovative product candidates. Our in-house research and development team focuses on the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of oncology and autoimmune diseases. We believe our discovery efforts will enable us to achieve our long-term goal of generating a sustainable, internally discovered product pipeline of new product candidates for patients around the world. This effort has resulted in the identification of a number of proprietary candidates against targets in our focus areas that include immuno-oncology, DNA damage response/repair and oncogenic signaling that we are moving into pre-clinical development. Our company has a leadership team with extensive pharmaceutical research, development and commercialization track records in both global and Chinese biopharmaceutical companies. We believe this team and our in-house discovery and development capabilities will enable us to achieve our long-term goal of commercializing our internally discovered innovative medicine for patients worldwide. In addition, we collaborate with external research partners, such as leading CROs, academic institutions and commercial partners. We contract with these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials. For details, see “Suppliers.” 
 For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our research and development expenses were US$142.2 million and US$222.7 million, respectively. Our expenditures incurred on research and development activities include the following: (i) expenses incurred for payments to CROs, investigators and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical studies; (ii) employee compensation related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity compensation expense; (iii) expenses for licensors; (iv) the cost of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing clinical study materials; (v) facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include office leases and other overhead expenses; (vi) costs associated with pre-clinical activities and regulatory operations; (vii) expenses associated with the construction and maintenance of our manufacturing facilities; and (viii) costs associated with operating as a public company.

  GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 Regulation 
 Government Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval 
 PRC regulation of pharmaceutical product development and approval 
 Since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, the PRC government has made significant efforts to standardize regulations, develop its pharmaceutical regulatory system and strengthen intellectual property protection. 
 In October 2017, the pharmaceutical regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform. The General Office of the State Council and the General Committee of the PRC Communist Party jointly issued a mandatory plan to further the reform of the review and approval system and encourage the innovation of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, or the Innovation Opinion. The expedited programs and other advantages under this and other recent reforms encourage pharmaceutical manufacturers to seek marketing approval in China first and develop products in high priority disease areas, such as oncology, or rare disease areas. 
 To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the Standing Committee of the NPC and the NMPA recently amended the PRC Drug Administration Law, which became effective on December 1, 2019. The NMPA subsequently promulgated two key implementing regulations for the PRC Drug Administration Law: (i) the amended Drug Registration Regulation; and (ii) the amended PRC Drug Manufacturing Regulation. Both became effective on July 1, 2020. The 2020 Drug Registration Regulation provides detailed procedural and substantive requirements for the key regulatory concepts established by the 2019 Amendment to the PRC Drug Administration Law. It confirms a number of reform actions that have been taken in the past years, including but not limited to: (1) the fully implementation of MAH system and implied approval for the commencement of clinical trial; (2) implementing associated review of drugs, excipients and packaging materials; and (3) introducing four expedited approval pathways, namely the breakthrough designation, conditional approvals, prioritized reviews and special reviews and approvals. 
 Regulatory authorities 
 In China, the NMPA is the authority under the State Administration for Market Regulation that monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, medical appliances and equipment, and cosmetics. The primary responsibilities of the NMPA include: 
 

• | monitoring and supervising the administration of pharmaceutical products, medical appliances and equipment as well as cosmetics in China;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | formulating administrative rules and policies concerning the supervision and administration of the pharmaceutical, medical device and cosmetics industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluating, registering and approving of new drugs, generic drugs, imported drugs and traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approving and issuing permits for the manufacture and export/import of pharmaceutical products, as well as medical appliances and equipment, and approving the establishment of enterprises to be engaged in the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | examining and evaluating the safety of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and cosmetics and handling significant accidents involving these products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The National Health and Family Planning Commission, or NHFPC, is rebranded as the National Health Commission, or NHC. The NHC is an authority at the ministerial level under the State Council and is primarily 
 
-28- 

  responsible for national public health. The NHC performs a variety of tasks in relation to the health industry such as establishing and overseeing the operation of medical institutes, which also serve as clinical trial sites, regulating the licensure of hospitals and producing professional codes of ethics for public medical personnel. 
 Drug Administration Laws and Regulations 
 The PRC Drug Administration Law was initially promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC in 1984 and the Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law was promulgated by the State Council in August 2002. The current PRC Drug Administration Law applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, distribution, application, supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products. It regulates and prescribes a framework for the administration of pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical distribution companies and medicinal preparations of medical institutions and the development, research, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertisements of pharmaceutical products. 
 Certain amendments to the PRC Drug Administration Law took effect on December 1, 2001. Subsequent amendments were also made on December 28, 2013, April 24, 2015 and August 26, 2019. The 2019 Amendment brought a series of changes to the drug supervision and administration system, including (1) the formalization of the drug marketing authorization holder system, or the MAH system; (2) expedited approval pathway; and (3) the cancellation of relevant certification in relation to Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practice. The 2019 Amendment requires the marketing authorization holder to assume responsibilities for the entire product life cycle, including pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing, post-marketing studies, monitoring, reporting and handling of adverse reactions of the drug. The 2019 Amendment also stipulates that the state supports the innovation of drugs with clinical value, encourages the development of drugs with new therapeutic mechanisms and multi-targeted, systematic adjustment and intervention of physiological function and promotes the technological advancement of drugs. 
 According to the PRC Drug Administration Law, no pharmaceutical products may be produced in China without a pharmaceutical production license. A local manufacturer of pharmaceutical products must obtain a pharmaceutical production license from one of the provincial administrations of medical products in order to commence production of pharmaceuticals. Prior to granting such license, the relevant government authority will inspect the manufacturer’s production facilities, and decide whether the sanitary conditions, quality assurance system, management structure and equipment within the facilities have met the required standards. 
 Collecting and Using Patients’ Biospecimens and Derived Data 
 In June 1998, the Ministry of Science and Technology, or MOST, and the former MOH jointly established the Tentative Rules for Protecting and Utilizing Human Genetic Resources in China. In July 2015, the MOST issued the Service Guide for Administrative Licensing Items concerning Examination and Approval of Sampling, Collecting, Trading, Exporting Human Genetic Resources or Taking Such Resources out of China. The Service Guide provides that foreign-invested sponsors that collect and use patients’ biospecimens in clinical trials shall be required to file with the China Human Genetic Resources Administrative Office, or the HGRAO, through its online system. 
 In October 2017, the MOST issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval for collecting and using human genetic resources for the purpose of commercializing a drug in China. 
 In May 2019, the State Council of PRC issued the Regulation on the Administration of PRC Human Genetic Resources, which formalizes the approval requirements pertinent to research collaborations between Chinese and foreign-owned entities. Pursuant to this new regulation, a new notification filing system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) is put in place for international clinical trials using PRC patients’ biospecimens at clinical study sites without involving the export of such biospecimens outside of China. The 
 
-29- 

  notification filing shall specify the type, quantity and usage of the biospecimens, among others, with the HGRAO before conducting such clinical trials. The collection and use of PRC patients’ biospecimens in basic scientific research collaborations involving export are still subject to the approval of the HGRAO. 
 In October 2020, the Standing Committee of the NPC promulgated the PRC Biosecurity Law, which will take effect on April 15, 2021. The PRC Biosecurity Law reaffirms the regulatory requirements stipulated by the HGR Regulation while potentially increasing the administrative fines significantly in cases where foreign entities are alleged to have collected, preserved or exported Chinese human genetic resources. 
 Data Privacy and Data Protection 
 China continues to strengthen its regulation of network security, data protection, and personal information (including personal health information). For example, the Cyber Security Law of China (effective since June 2017), or the Cyber Security Law, provides China’s first national-level network and data security regulation. The Cyber Security Law regulates network operators, a broad category that covers all organizations in China that own, operate or manage computer networks, and requires them to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Additional regulations, guidelines and measures under the framework of the Cyber Security Law are expected to be adopted and require more stringent compliance requirements. Some of these measures have already been published in draft form, including the Measures on Security Assessment of Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information and Important Data (Draft for Comment), published in 2017, and the Measures on Security Assessment for Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information (Draft for Comment), published by the Cyberspace Administration of China in 2019. In addition, China has also published in draft form new laws that seek to establish a more robust framework for data protection and privacy, including the Personal Information Protection Law (Draft) and the Data Security Law (Draft), both published in 2020. In particular, the Personal Information Protection Law (Draft), if enacted, would become China’s first omnibus law regulating the collection, processing and use of personal information. These proposed measures and laws, which indicate a trend of more stringent compliance requirement, and if enacted, may require a security assessment and review, government certification or conclusion of a data transfer agreement with the recipient before transferring personal health information out of China and may impose compliance requirements on our entities established outside China that process the personal information of individuals in China in certain circumstances. The Cyber Security Law, together with other industry-specific laws and regulations, also require us to obtain consent from clinical trial subjects, customers, employees and other individuals before collecting their personal information, including personal health information, take measures to keep personal information secure and confidential and report security breaches involving personal information to competent industry regulators. These areas are expected to receive greater attention and focus from regulators. 
 Network security, data protection and personal information in other jurisdictions, including the United States, also continue to strengthen. Numerous United States federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (CCPA), went into operation on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action related to certain data security breaches. These protections will be expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which was approved by California voters in November 2020 and will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. There are similar legislative proposals being advanced in other states, as well as in Congress. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we may obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not considered to be a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, we could be subject to penalties if we use or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative 
 
-30- 

  and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including laws in all 50 states requiring security breach notification in some circumstances. The CCPA, CPRA, HIPAA and these other laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. 
 Regulations on the Clinical Trials 
 Four Phases of Clinical Trials 
 According to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, a clinical development program consists of Phases I, II, III and IV clinical trial, as well as bioequivalence trial. Based on the characteristics of study drugs and research objectives, the four phases of studies respectively focus on clinical pharmacology, exploratory, confirmatory and post-approval assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Approval Authority for Clinical Trial Applications 
 According to the 2019 Amendment of the PRC Drug Administration Law and the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, clinical studies on investigational drugs must be approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation, also known as the CDE, before its commencement. 
International Multi-Center Clinical Trials 
 On January 30, 2015, the NMPA promulgated Notice on Issuing the International Multi-Center Clinical Trial Guidelines (Tentative), or the Multi-Center Clinical Trial Guidelines, which took effect as of March 1, 2015, aiming to provide guidance for the regulation of application, implementation and administration of international multi-center clinical trials in China. Where the applicant plans to make use of the data derived from the international multi-center clinical trials for application to NMPA for approval of an NDA, such international multi-center clinical trials shall satisfy, in addition to the requirements set forth in the PRC Drug Administration Law and its implementation regulations, Drug Registration Regulation, GCP of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH-GCP”), research ethics and the following requirements: 
 

• | The applicant shall first conduct an overall evaluation on the global clinical trial data and further make trend analysis of the Asian and Chinese clinical trial data. In the analysis of Chinese clinical trial data, the applicant shall consider the representativeness of the research subjects, i.e., the participating patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The applicant shall analyze whether the amount of Chinese research subjects is sufficient to assess and adjudicate the safety and effectiveness of the drug under clinical trial and satisfy the statistical and relevant legal requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The onshore and offshore international multi-center clinical trial research centers shall be subject to on-site inspections by competent PRC governmental agencies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To encourage innovation and improve accessibility of new drugs, foreign pharmaceutical companies are permitted to conduct international multicenter clinical trials in China from Phase 1 and can apply for marketing authorizations immediately after completion of the international multicenter clinical trials. The application for NDA is not conditional upon the issuance of marketing authorization for the same new drug in the country of origin. Leveraging the clinical trial data derived from international multi-center clinical trials conducted by our partners, we may avoid unnecessary repetitive clinical trials and thus further accelerate the NDA process in China. 
 Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trial Data and Trial Waiver 
 On July 6, 2018, the NMPA issued the Technical Guiding Principles on Accepting Foreign Drug Clinical Trial Data (“Guiding Principles”). According to the Guiding Principles, the data of foreign clinical trials must 
 
-31- 

  meet the authenticity, completeness, accuracy and traceability requirements, and such data must be obtained in consistency with the relevant requirements under the ICH-GCP. Clinical trial sponsors must be attentive to potentially meaningful ethnic differences in the subject population. 
 The NMPA now permits, and its predecessor agencies have permitted on a case-by-case basis in the past, drugs approved outside of China to be approved in China on a conditional basis without pre-approval clinical trials being conducted in China. Specifically, in 2018, the NMPA and NHC issued the Procedures for Reviewing and Approval of Clinical Urgently Needed Overseas New Drugs, permitting drugs that have been approved within the last ten years in the United States, the European Union or Japan and that prevent or treat orphan diseases or prevent or treat serious life-threatening illnesses for which there is either no effective therapy in China or for which the foreign-approved drug would have clear clinical advantages. Applicants will be required to establish a risk mitigation plan and may be required to complete trials in China after the drug has been marketed. Since 2018, the CDE has published several lists of qualifying drugs that meet the foregoing criteria. 
 Compliance with GCP 
 The conduct of clinical trials must adhere to the GCP and the protocols approved by the ethics committees of each study site. To ensure authenticity and reliability of the clinical data, applicants of the pending drug registration submissions must conduct self-inspection and verification of their clinical trial data. Based on the submitted self-inspection results, the NMPA also regularly launched onsite clinical trial audits over selected applications and reject those found with data forgery. The GCP audit has been ongoing and was able to curb the number of unreliable NDAs. 
 In April 2020, the NMPA and the NHC released the amended GCP, which took effect on July 1, 2020. Compared to the previous GCP, the amended GCP provides comprehensive and substantive requirements on the design and conduct of clinical trials in China. In particular, the amended GCP enhances the protection for study subjects and tightens the control over bio-samples collected under clinical trials. 
 Regulations on Marketing Authorizations 
 The Marketing Authorization Holder System 
 Under the authorization of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, the State Council issued the Pilot Plan for the Drug Marketing Authorization Holder Mechanism on May 26, 2016, which provides a detailed pilot plan for the MAH System, for drugs in 10 provinces in China. Under the MAH System, domestic drug research and development institutions and individuals in the piloted regions are eligible to be holders of drug registrations without having to become drug manufacturers. The newly amended PRC Drug Administration Law rolled out this MAH system nationwide. Companies and research and development institutions can be drug marketing authorization holders after they receive the drug registration certificates. The drug marketing authorization holder should be responsible for their products throughout the life cycle, including pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, production and distribution, post-market studies and the monitoring, reporting, and handling of adverse reactions in connection with pharmaceuticals in accordance with the PRC Drug Administration Law. The marketing authorization holders may engage licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers for manufacturing and may engage pharmaceutical distribution enterprises with drug distribution license for the distribution activities. Upon receiving the marketing authorizations from the NMPA, a drug marketing authorization holder may transfer its drug marketing authorization and the transferee should have the capability of quality management, risk prevention and control and liability compensation to ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality controllability of drugs and fulfill the obligations of the drug marketing authorization holder. 
New Drug Application 
 When Phases I, II and III of the clinical trials have been completed, the applicant may apply to the NMPA for approval of an NDA. The NMPA then determines whether to approve the application according to the 
 
-32- 

  comprehensive evaluation opinion provided by the CDE of the NMPA. We must obtain approval of an NDA before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the China market. 
 According to the Opinions on Encouraging Priority Review and Approval for Drug Innovations, for new drugs which are developed for severe, life-threatening diseases currently lacking effective treatment and have great significance for meeting clinical needs, if, based on early-stage clinical trial data, the clinical benefits of such drugs can be reasonably predicted or decided and such drugs have distinctive advantages comparing with existing treatments, such new drugs may obtain a conditional approval for marketing before the completion of Phase III clinical trials undertaken to confirm its therapeutic effectiveness. Such conditional approval process has been further enacted into the 2019 Amendment. 
 Drug Marketing Authorization 
 According to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, the applicant may submit an application for drug marketing authorization to CDE upon completion of relevant research on pharmacy, pharmacology, toxicology and drug clinical trials, determination the quality standards of the drug, validation of commercial-scale production processes and preparation for acceptance of verification and inspection conducted by the Center for Food and Drug Inspection (CFDI). The NMPA then determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive technical review by the CDE. We must obtain approval of drug marketing authorizations before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the China market. 
Drug Technology Transfer and Marketing Authorization Transfer 
 On August 19, 2009, the former SFDA promulgated the Administrative Regulations for Technology Transfer Registration of Drugs to standardize the registration process of drug technology transfer, which includes application for, and evaluation, examination, approval and monitoring of, drug technology transfer. With respect to imported drugs with imported drug licenses, the original applicants for the imported drug licenses may transfer these drug manufacturing technologies to domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprises. Applications for drug technology transfer should be submitted to the provincial medical products administration where the transferee is located. The CDE should further review the application materials, provide technical evaluation opinions and form a comprehensive evaluation opinion based on the site inspection reports and the testing results of the samples. 
 The PRC Drug Administration Law and the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation allow for the transfer of marketing authorization under the MAH system. In January 2021, the NMPA published the Administrative Measures for Post-approval Changes to Drugs (Tentative), or the Measures on Post-Approval Changes. If the manufacture of an imported drug is relocated to China through manufacturing technology transfer, the transferee in China can choose to file a supplemental application with the provincial medical product administration with technical data showing consistency of quality and manufacturing processes during the two-year grace period from January 13, 2021. Alternatively, the transferee in China can file a marketing authorization application with the CDE referencing technical data in the original import drug approval application dossier. 
 Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit and GMP 
 To manufacture pharmaceutical products in the PRC, a pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprise must first obtain a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit issued by the relevant pharmaceutical administrative authorities at the provincial level where the enterprise is located. Among other things, such a permit must set forth the permit number, the name, legal representative and registered address of the enterprise, the site and scope of production, issuing institution, date of issuance and effective period. 
 According to the Implementing Measures of the PRC Drug Administration Law and the Drug Manufacturing Regulation, promulgated in August 2004 and amended in November 2017 and January 2020, 
 
-33- 

  respectively, each Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit issued to a pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprise is effective for five years. Any enterprise holding a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit is subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities on an annual basis. The enterprise is required to apply for renewal of such permit within six months prior to its expiry and will be subject to reassessment by the issuing authorities in accordance with then prevailing legal and regulatory requirements for the purposes of such renewal. 
 The Good Manufacturing Practice was promulgated in March 1988 and was amended in June 1999 and January 2011. The Good Manufacturing Practice comprises a set of detailed standard guidelines governing the manufacture of drugs, which includes institution and staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, hygiene conditions, production management, quality controls, product operation, raw material management, maintenance of sales records and management of customer complaints and adverse event reports. 
 Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit and GSP 
 To distribute pharmaceutical products in China, including wholesale and retail distribution, a pharmaceutical distribution enterprise must first obtain a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit. 
 Pursuant to the Administrative Measures of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit promulgated by the NMPA in February 2004 and subsequently amended in November 2017, each Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit issued to a pharmaceutical distribution enterprise is effective for five years. Any enterprise holding a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit is subject to periodic review and inspection by the relevant regulatory authorities. The enterprise is required to apply for renewal of such permit within six months prior to its expiry and will be subject to reassessment by the issuing authorities in accordance with then prevailing legal and regulatory requirements for the purposes of such renewal. 
 The Good Supply Practice for Drugs (GSP) was promulgated in April 2000 and was amended respectively in November 2012, January 2013, June 2015 and July 2016. The Good Supply Practice for Drugs is the basic rules for drug operation and quality control, setting forth the requirements for pharmaceutical distribution enterprises throughout the process of procurement, storage, sales and transportation. 
 U.S. Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and their implementing regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local rules and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. Our drug and biologic candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA and BLA processes, respectively, before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

• | completion of extensive pre-clinical studies, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in compliance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-34- 

  
• | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable good clinical practices, or GCPs and other clinical trial-related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within sixty (60) days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug or biological product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies 
 The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, or NCEs, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, evaluating purity and stability, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective thirty (30) days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that thirty-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term pre-clinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, submission of an IND does not guarantee the FDA will allow clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 
Clinical Studies 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to human subjects or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are accurate, and that the rights, safety and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs also include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB to 
 
-35- 

  ensure that risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. For example, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. 
 

• | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III: The product candidate is administered to an expanded number of patients, generally at multiple sites that are geographically dispersed, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety profile and to establish the overall benefit/risk profile of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for approval and labeling. Phase III clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk to human subjects. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long term stability and quality of the final drug or biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
-36- 

  NDA and BLA Review and Approval 
 After the successful completion of clinical studies of a drug or biological product, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA respectively must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug or biologic and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be offered for sale in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial application user fee in the range of several million dollars. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA or BLA within sixty days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant within ten months from the filing date for a standard NDA or BLA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and Priority Review NDAs and BLAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug or biologic is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA may re-analyze the clinical trial data, which can result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 
-37- 

  If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient populations or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs or biologics. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 Pediatric Trials 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a NDA or BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must also submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant orphan designate to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that the disease or condition affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA or BLA. If the request is granted, FDA will publicly disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.

  Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements and complying with applicable promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may legally prescribe products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA and BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
 In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Rest of the World Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval 
 For other countries outside of China and the United States, such as countries in Europe, Latin America or other parts of Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and 
 
-39- 

  reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 PRC Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Historically, most Chinese healthcare costs had been borne by patients out-of-pocket, which had limited the growth of more expensive pharmaceutical products. However, in recent years the number of people covered by government and private insurance has increased. According to the National Healthcare Security Administration, or the NHSA, as of December 2019, approximately 1.3 billion residents in China were enrolled in the Basic Medical Insurance scheme, representing a coverage rate of above 95% of the total population. 
Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program 
 The Basic Medical Insurance scheme was adopted pursuant to the Decision of the State Council on the Establishment of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance Program issued by the State Council on December 14, 1998, under which all employers in urban cities are required to enroll their employees in the Basic Medical Insurance scheme and the insurance premium is jointly contributed by the employers and employees. The State Council promulgated Guiding Opinions for the Pilot of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance on July 10, 2007, under which urban residents of the pilot district, rather than urban employees, may voluntarily join Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance. 
 The Interim Measures for the Administration of Use of Drugs Covered by the Basic Medical Insurance was promulgated by NHSA in July 2020 and came into effect in September 2020. According to which, expenses of drugs listed in the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog, typically known in the industry as the National Reimbursable Drug List (NRDL),will be paid in full or part from the basic medical insurance fund in accordance with applicable provisions, and the drugs with the same generic names as those specified in the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog will be automatically regulated by the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog and shall also be eligible for the reimbursement by the basic medical insurance fund. These measures further clarify that the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog shall be promulgated by the NHSA and adjusted on an annual basis. Provinces shall have the right to add eligible ethnic drugs, preparations of medical institutions, and traditional Chinese medicine decoction pieces into the provincial medical insurance-based payment scope, which shall be implemented after being filed with the NHSA for record. 
 The PRC Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, together with other government authorities, have the power to determine the medicines included in the NRDL. In August 2019, the NHSA and the PRC Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security released the National Drug Catalogue for Basic Medical Insurance, Work-Related Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance, or the 2019 NRDL and 70 new drugs were admitted to the 2019 NRDL with an average price reduction of 60.7%. In December 2020, the NHSA and the PRC Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security released the National Drug Catalogue for Basic Medical Insurance, Work-Related Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance, or the 2020 NRDL and 119 new drugs were admitted to the 2020 NRDL with an average price reduction of 50.64%. 
 Medicines included in the NRDL are divided into two classes, Class A and Class B. Patients purchasing medicines included in the NRDL are entitled to reimbursement of the entire amount or a certain percentage of the purchase price. The percentage of reimbursement for Class B medicines differs from region to region in the PRC.

  National List of Essential Drugs 
 On August 18, 2009, the former MOH and eight other ministries and commissions in the PRC issued the Provisional Measures on the Administration of the National List of Essential Drugs, or NEDL, and the Guidelines on the Implementation of the NEDL System. The provisional measures aimed to promote essential medicines sold to consumers at fair prices in the PRC and ensured that the general public in the PRC has equal access to the drugs contained in the NEDL. The Provisional Measures on the Administration of the National List of Essential Drugs was then amended in February 2015. The former MOH promulgated the NEDL (Catalog for the Basic Healthcare Institutions) on August 18, 2009, a revised NEDL on March 13, 2013 and another revised NEDL on September 30, 2018 which became effective on November 1, 2018. According to these regulations, basic healthcare institutions funded by government, which primarily include county-level hospitals, county-level Chinese medicine hospitals, rural clinics and community clinics, shall store up and use drugs listed in NEDL. The drugs listed in NEDL shall be purchased by centralized tender process and shall be subject to the price control by NDRC. Drugs listed in the NEDL will be given priority to being listed in the NRDL. 
Commercial Insurance 
 On October 25, 2016, the State Council and the Communist Party of China jointly issued the Plan for Healthy China 2030. According to the Plan, the country will establish a multi-level medical security system built around basic medical insurance, with other forms of insurance supplementing the basic medical insurance, including serious illness insurance for urban and rural residents, commercial health insurance and medical assistance. Furthermore, the Plan encourages enterprises and individuals to participate in commercial health insurance and various forms of supplementary insurance. The evolving medical insurance system makes innovative drugs more affordable and universally available to the Chinese population, which renders greater opportunities to drug manufacturers that focus on the research and development of innovative drugs, such as high-cost cancer therapeutics. 
Price Controls 
 Instead of direct price controls which were historically used in China but abolished in June 2016, the government regulates prices mainly by establishing a price negotiations, consolidated procurement mechanism and revising medical insurance reimbursement standards as discussed below. 
Price Negotiations 
 The Chinese government has initiated several rounds of price negotiations with manufacturers of patented drugs, drugs with an exclusive source of supply and oncology drugs since 2016. The average percentage of price reduction has been over 50%. Once the government agreed with the drug manufacturers on the supply prices, the drugs would be automatically listed in the NRDL and qualified for public hospital purchase. 
Centralized Procurement and Tenders 
 The Guiding Opinions concerning the Urban Medical and Health System Reform, promulgated on February 21, 2000, aims to regulate the purchasing process of pharmaceutical products by medical institutions. The former MOH and other relevant government authorities have promulgated a series of regulations and releases in order to implement the tender requirements. 
 On January 17, 2009, the former MOH, the former SFDA and other four national departments jointly promulgated the Opinions on Further Regulating Centralized Procurement of Drugs by Medical Institutions. According to the notice, public hospitals owned by the government at the county level or higher or owned by state-owned enterprises (including state-controlled enterprises) shall purchase pharmaceutical products by online centralized procurement. Each provincial government shall formulate its catalogue of drugs subject to centralized 
 
-41- 

  procurement. Except for drugs in the National List of Essential Drugs (the procurement of which shall comply with the relevant rules on National List of Essential Drugs), certain pharmaceutical products which are under the national government’s special control, such as toxic, radioactive and narcotic drugs and traditional Chinese medicines, in principle, all drugs used by public medical institutions shall be covered by the catalogue of drugs subject to centralized procurement. On July 7, 2010, the former MOH and six other ministries and commissions jointly promulgated the Notice on Printing and Distributing the Working Regulations of Medical Institutions for Centralized Procurement of Drugs to further regulate the centralized procurement of drugs and clarify the code of conduct of the parties in centralized drug procurement. 
 The centralized tender process takes the form of public tender operated and organized by provincial or municipal government agencies. The centralized tender process is in principle conducted once every year in the relevant province or city in China. The bids are assessed by a committee composed of pharmaceutical and medical experts who will be randomly selected from a database of experts approved by the relevant government authorities. The committee members assess the bids based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, bid price, product quality, clinical effectiveness, product safety, qualifications and reputation of the manufacturer, after-sale services and innovation. Only pharmaceuticals that have won in the centralized tender process may be purchased by public medical institutions funded by the governmental or state-owned enterprise (including state-controlled enterprises) in the relevant region. 
 “4+7” Volume-based Drug Procurement and Tenders 
 In June 2018, the State Council decided to launch a new round of drug pricing and procurement reform. This reform is implemented mainly by the NHSA. The NHC supports the reform by introducing policy that encourages purchasing and prescribing of the selected drug and managing the supplier’s behavior. The NMPA is responsible for the quality assurance of the drug. 
 On November 15, 2018, the Joint Procurement Office, the procurement alliance formed by representatives of procurement agencies in 11 pilot cities established to oversee the bidding and procurement process, published the Paper on Drug Centralized Procurement in “4+7” Regions, launching the national pilot scheme for centralized volume-based drug procurement and tenders. According to the papers, the initial procurement of 31 generic drugs was implemented in 4 municipalities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing and 7 cities, namely Shenyang, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an, Dalian, Chengdu and Xiamen. This pilot program is thus also referred to as the “4+7” procurement scheme. On January 17, 2019, the General Office of the State Council published a circular on National Pilot Program for Centralized Procurement and Use of Drug, which provides detailed implementing measures for the nation-wide centralized drug procurement and tender scheme. 
 The “4+7” pilot program puts special emphasis on procurement volume guarantee. Public hospitals in pilot regions are encouraged to form a group procurement organization to increase the negotiation leverage. The committed volume will be shared by all qualified bid-winners, and public hospitals should prioritize their use of drugs purchased through the volume-based procurement in order to realize the volume commitment. Under this program, a company is provided with a substantial volume guarantee. The selected drugs must pass the generic drug consistency evaluation on quality and effectiveness. The reform policy is aimed to lower drug costs for patients, reduce transaction costs for enterprises, regulate drug use of hospitals, and improve the centralized drug procurement and pricing system. The centralized volume-based procurement is open to all approved enterprises that manufacture drugs on the government-set procurement list in China. Clinical effects, adverse reactions and batch stability of the drugs are considered, and their quality consistency with the originator drugs will be the main criteria for evaluation. Production capacity and stability of the supplier are also considered. 
 The NHSA organized four rounds of volume-based procurement and tenders to this date. On February 3, 2021, the results of the fourth round of the volume-based procurement and tender were announced. All of the 45 products were successfully qualified to enter into a supply agreement with the group procurement organization and the average price reduction approximately 52%. 
 
-42- 

  Two-invoice System 
 In addition to the centralized tender process, the Chinese government also rolled out a “two-invoice system” nationwide in 2018. In the two-invoice system, in principle there can be no more than two invoices issued for drug products supplied by manufacturers to public hospitals. To satisfy with this requirement, many drug manufacturers have reduced the tiers of distributors, or converted drug distributors into contracted service organizations. This excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly-owned or controlled distributors, or for imported drugs, to its exclusive distributor, or from a distributor to its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiary (or between its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries). However, the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in China. The reduction in distribution tiers resulted in a decrease in distribution mark-ups, hence the supply prices to public hospitals would also be reduced. Compliance with the two-invoice system is a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in the tender and procurement processes of public hospitals, which currently provide most of PRC healthcare services. Manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the two-invoice system may lose their qualifications to participate in the tender and procurement process. Non-compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to public hospitals. The two-invoice system has been implemented in all provinces, each with its own regional implementation rules. 
 Medical Insurance Reimbursement Standards 
 The Opinions on Integrating the Basic Medical Insurance Systems for Urban and Rural Residents issued by the State Council on January 3, 2016, call for the integration of the urban resident basic medical insurance and the new rural cooperative medical care system and the establishment of a unified basic medical insurance system, which will cover all urban and rural residents other than rural migrant workers and persons in flexible employment arrangement who participate in the basic medical insurance for urban employees. 
 The General Office of the State Council further announced a master plan for the medical insurance reimbursement reform in June 2017. The main objectives are to implement a diversified reimbursement mechanism including DRGs, per-capita caps and per-bed-day caps. These new reimbursement methods will be rolled out nationwide by 2020 to replace the current reimbursement method that is based on service category and product price. Local administration of healthcare security will introduce a total budget control for their jurisdictions and decide the amount of reimbursement to public hospitals based on hospitals’ performance and the spending targets of individual basic medical insurance funds. In June 2019, the NHSA, the Ministry of Finance, the NHC and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine jointly issued the Notice on the National List of Pilot Cities for the DRG Payment Mechanism, identifying 30 cities as pilot cities for the DRG payment pilot program, proposing to further the medical insurance reimbursement reform. 
 To further standardize payment in the national Basic Medical Insurance schemes, in October 2019, the NHSA issued two key technical documents for a pilot project that introduces DRGs—the Technical Guideline of the Classification and Payment for China Healthcare Security Diagnosis Related Groups (CHS-DRG) and the CHS-DRG Classification Plan. According to the classification plan, patients will be sorted into 26 major diagnostic categories and 376 adjacent diagnosis-related groups. DRG-based payments are made directly to the participating medical institutions, while the covered benefits enjoyed by the insureds, under the current public insurance schemes, are not affected by such settlement. In June 2020, the NHSA issued a more detailed CHS-DRG Classification Plan, further dividing the 376 diagnosis-related groups into 618 basic reimbursement unit. The 30 municipalities participating in the DRG pilot project are required to submit technical assessment report to the local branch of NHSA before August 31, 2020. Upon receiving NHSA’s approval, the participating municipalities may commence conducting simulation runs of the pilot project. After the simulation runs, the DRG-based settlement system is expected to launch in 2021. 
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Successful sales of our drug candidates in the U.S. market, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs are covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health 
 
-43- 

  programs or private health insurance (including managed care plans). Patients who are provided with prescriptions as part of their medical treatment generally rely on such third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescriptions and therefore adequate coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors are critical to new and ongoing product acceptance. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services and implementing measures to control utilization of drugs (such as requiring prior authorization for coverage). Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. If our drug candidates are approved, limitations on coverage or reimbursement as well as price controls and cost-containment measures could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Health care reform initiatives have resulted in significant changes to the coverage, reimbursement and delivery of health care, including drugs. Health care reform efforts are likely to continue and such efforts have included, and may include in the future, attempts to repeal or modify prior healthcare reform. 
 General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, resulted in 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021). If we obtain approval to market a drug candidate in the United States, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Other PRC Healthcare Laws 
 Advertising of Pharmaceutical Products 
 Pursuant to the Interim Administrative Measures for the Review of Advertisements for Drugs, Medical Devices, Health Food and Formula Food for Special Medical Purposes promulgated in December 2019 and became effective in March 2020, an enterprise seeking to advertise its pharmaceutical products must apply for an advertisement approval number. The advertisement approval number is issued by the relevant local administrative authority. The validity term of the advertisement approval number for drugs shall be consistent with the shortest validity term of the production registration certificate, filing certificate or production license. If no valid term is prescribed in the production registration certificate, filing certificate or production license, the valid term of the advertisement approval number shall be two years. The content of an approved advertisement may not be altered without prior approval. 
Insert Sheet and Labels of Pharmaceutical Products 
 According to the Measures for the Administration of the Insert Sheets and Labels of Drugs effective on June 1, 2006, the insert sheets and labels of drugs should be reviewed and approved by the NMPA (previously the SFDA). A drug insert sheet should include the scientific data, conclusions and information concerning drug safety and efficacy in order to direct the safe and rational use of drugs. The inner label of a drug should bear such information as the drug’s name, indication or function, strength, dose and usage, production date, batch number, expiry date and drug manufacturer, and the outer label of a drug should indicate such information as the drug’s name, ingredients, description, indication or function, strength, dose and usage and adverse reaction. 
Packaging of Pharmaceutical Products 
 According to the Measures for the Administration of Pharmaceutical Packaging effective on September 1, 1988, pharmaceutical packaging must comply with the national and industry standards. If no national or industry 
 
-44- 

  standards are available, the enterprise can formulate its own standards and put into implementation after obtaining the approval of the administration of medical products or bureau of standards at provincial level. The enterprise shall re-apply with the relevant authorities if it needs to change its own packaging standard. Drugs that have not developed and received approval for packaging standards must not be sold or distributed in China (except for drugs for the military). 
 Other U.S. Healthcare and Regulatory Laws 
 Within the United States, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities that may follow drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 We may therefore be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and transparency laws, such as the following: 
 

• | the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private health plans) or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members

-45- 

  
of the healthcare industry and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to specific regulatory requirements, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 
 If and when we become subject to these various healthcare and regulatory laws, efforts to ensure that our activities comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. Many of these laws and their implementing regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to challenge. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business. 
 Other Significant PRC Regulation Affecting Our Business Activities in China 
 PRC Regulation of Foreign Investment 
 The establishment, operation and management of corporate entities in China are governed by the Company Law of the PRC, or the PRC Company Law, which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC in December 1993, implemented in July 1994 and subsequently amended in December 1999, August 2004, October 2005, December 2013 and October 2018. Under the PRC Company Law, companies are generally classified into two categories: limited liability companies and companies limited by shares. The PRC Company Law also applies to foreign-invested limited liability companies. Pursuant to the PRC Company Law, where laws on foreign investment have other stipulations, such stipulations shall prevail. 
 Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are governed by the Guiding Foreign Investment Direction, which was promulgated by the State Council on February 11, 2002 and came into effect on April 1, 2002, and the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2019), or the Negative List, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM and National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC on June 30, 2019 and took effect on July 30, 2019. The Negative List set out the restrictive measures in a unified manner, such as the requirements on shareholding percentages and management, for the access of foreign investments and the industries that are prohibited for foreign investment. The Negative List covers 13 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment to domestic and foreign investment. 
 Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Foreign Investment Law was promulgated by the NPC in March 2019 and become effective in January 2020. After the Foreign Investment Law came into force, the Law on Wholly Foreign- Owned Enterprises, the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Law on Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously. The investment activities of foreign natural persons, enterprises or other organizations (hereinafter referred to as “foreign investors”) directly or indirectly within the territory of China shall comply with and be governed by the Foreign Investment Law: 1) establishing by foreign investors of foreign-invested enterprises in China alone or jointly with other investors; 2) acquiring by foreign investors of shares, equity, property shares, or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; 3) investing by foreign investors in new projects in China alone or jointly with other investors; and 4) other forms of investment prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council. 
 
-46- 

  In December 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC came into effect, the Regulation on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino- Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise, the Regulations on Implementing the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law have been repealed simultaneously. 
 In December 2019, the MOFCOM and the State Administration for Market Regulation issued the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information came into effect, the Interim Measures on the Administration of Filing for Establishment and Change of Foreign Investment Enterprises has been repealed simultaneously. Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment activities directly or indirectly in China, the foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the commerce authorities pursuant to these measures. 
 PRC Regulation of Commercial Bribery 
 Pharmaceutical companies involved in a criminal investigation or administrative proceedings related to bribery are listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies by its provincial health and family planning administrative department. Pursuant to the Provisions on the Establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies in the Medicine Purchase and Sales Industry which became effective on March 1, 2014, provincial health and family planning administrative departments formulate the implementing measures for establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies. If a pharmaceutical company is listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies for the first time, their production is not required to be purchased by public medical institutions. A pharmaceutical company will not be penalized by the relevant PRC government authorities merely by virtue of having contractual relationships with distributors or third party promoters who are engaged in bribery activities, so long as such pharmaceutical company and its employees are not utilizing the distributors or third party promoters for the implementation of, or acting in conjunction with them in, the prohibited bribery activities. In addition, a pharmaceutical company is under no legal obligation to monitor the operating activities of its distributors and third party promoters, and will not be subject to penalties or sanctions by relevant PRC government authorities as a result of failure to monitor their operating activities. 
 PRC Regulation of Product Liability 
 In addition to the strict new drug approval process, certain PRC laws have been promulgated to protect the rights of consumers and to strengthen the control of medical products in the PRC. Under current PRC law, manufacturers and vendors of defective products in the PRC may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such products. According to the Civil Code of the PRC which was promulgated in May 2020 and became effective in January 2021, a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability for such damage or injury. 
 On February 22, 1993, the Product Quality Law of the PRC, or the Product Quality Law, was promulgated aiming to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the end-users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. The Product Quality Law was last revised in December 2018, pursuant to which, manufacturers who produce defective products may be subject to civil or criminal liability and have their business licenses revoked. 
 The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and was amended on August 27, 2009 and October 25, 2013 to protect consumers’ rights when they purchase or use goods and accept services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. Under the latest amendment, all business operators shall pay close attention to protect the customers’ privacy and strictly keep confidential any consumer 
 
-47- 

  information they obtain during the business operation. In addition, in extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and operators may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties. 
 PRC Tort Law 
 Under the Civil Code of the PRC, if damages to other persons are caused by defective products due to the fault of a third party, such as the parties providing transportation or warehousing, the producers and the sellers of the products have the right to recover their respective losses from such third parties. If defective products are identified after they have been put into circulation, the producers and the sellers shall take remedial measures such as stopping the sales, issuance of a warning, recall of products, among others. in a timely manner. The producers or the sellers shall be liable under tort if they fail to take remedial measures in a timely manner or have not made efforts to take remedial measures, thus causing damages. If the products are produced or sold with known defects, causing deaths or severe adverse health issues, the infringed party has the right to claim punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. 
PRC Regulation of Intellectual Property Rights 
 China has made substantial efforts to adopt comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and domain names. 
 Patents 
 Pursuant to the PRC Patent Law, most recently amended in October 2020 (which will come into effect in June 2021), and its implementation rules, most recently amended in January 2010 (but for which a draft amendment was published for public comment in November 2020), patents in China fall into three categories: invention, utility model and design. An invention patent is granted to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product or method or an improvement of a product or method. A utility model is granted to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure or a combination of both of a product. A design patent is granted to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern or a combination of both and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the PRC Patent Law, the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years, and utility models and designs are effective for ten years and fifty years from the date of application respectively. The PRC Patent Law adopts the principle of “first-to-file” system, which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first. 
 Existing patents can become narrowed, invalid or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. Under the PRC Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the China National Intellectual Property Administration, or CNIPA. Normally, the CNIPA publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the CNIPA for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application. 
 Article 20 of the PRC Patent Law provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant (not just Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of China, must 
 
-48- 

  first submit it to the CNIPA for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the relevant invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the CNIPA has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in China or outsource research and development activities to service providers in China. 
 Patent Term Extension and Adjustment 
 On October 17, 2020, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee passed the Fourth Amendment to the Patent Law (also called the new Patent Law) which, when it takes effect on June 1, 2021, for the first time, will provide for patent term extension and adjustments for certain patents. Under the new Patent Law, patent term extensions can be obtained for regulatory delays in the review and approval of new drugs but are limited to no more than five years and the total post-marketing patent term of the new drug cannot exceed 14 years. The new Patent Law also provides for patent term adjustments where there is an unreasonable delay caused during patent examination. A patentee may apply for a patent term adjustment where the patent is granted at least four years after the filing date, and at least three years after substantive examination was requested. It remains to be seen how the patent term extensions and adjustments under the new Patent Law will be implemented. China published draft amendments to the Implementing Regulations of the Patent Law on November 27, 2020, which provides further details on what is an unreasonably delay in respect of patent term adjustments and proposes certain limitations on the types of patents eligible for patent term extensions, details of how amount of the extension would be determined and applicability to drug products covered by the relevant patent. For example, there is a risk that the patent term extension will only apply where approval in China by the NMPA is the first approval anywhere in the world. 
Patent Linkage 
 The new Patent Law, for the first time, introduces in China a patent linkage system for the early resolution of patent disputes concerning generic drug applications similar to the Hatch Waxman Act in the United States. Under the patent linkage system in the new Patent Law, a pharmaceutical patentee or an interested party may sue in court an applicant applying for marketing approval of a drug product that is covered by the patent. They may also request a China National Intellectual Property Administration, also called the CNIPA, to make an administrative ruling as to whether such drug product falls within the protected scope of the relevant patent. The new Patent Law also provides a legal basis for the NMPA to stay the review of the marketing approval application for the drug product based on the court ruling. However, to be implemented, the patent term extensions and adjustments and patent linkage system require further promulgation of regulations and detailed implementation measures and draft regulations and measures have already been published. The National Medical Products Administration and the CNIPA jointly issued on September 11, 2020 a draft of the Implementation Measures for Early Resolution Mechanism of Pharmaceutical Patent Disputes (for Trial Implementation) for public comment which sets forth, for the first time, details of how such patent linkage system would be implemented. The CNIPA also published the Administrative Ruling Measures for the Early Resolution mechanism for Drug Patent Disputes (Draft for Solicitation of Comments) on February 9, 2021, which proposes details of how to seek the administrative ruling with CNIPA. The draft regulations and measures are expected to be finalized before the new Patent Law takes effect on June 1, 2021. 
Patent Enforcement 
 Unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other patent infringement acts, will subject the infringers to infringement liability. Serious offences such as forgery of patents may be subject to criminal penalties. 
 When a dispute arises out of infringement of the patent owner’s patent right, Chinese law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through mutual consultation. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through mutual consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, 
 
-49- 

  may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority. A Chinese court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner’s or an interested party’s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement, and if the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement cannot be determined, the damages for infringement shall be calculated as the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. Statutory damages may be awarded in the circumstances where the damages cannot be determined by the above-mentioned calculation standards. The damage calculation methods shall be applied in the aforementioned order. Generally, the patent owner has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed. However, if the owner of an invention patent for manufacturing process of a new product alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proof. 
 Medical Patent Compulsory License 
 According to the PRC Patent Law, for the purpose of public health, the CNIPA may grant a compulsory license for manufacturing patented drugs and exporting them to countries or regions covered under relevant international treaties to which PRC has acceded. 
Exemptions for Unlicensed Manufacture, Use, Sale or Import of Patented Products 
 The PRC Patent Law provides five exceptions for unauthorized manufacture, use, sale or import of patented products. None of following circumstances is deemed an infringement of the patent rights, and any person may manufacture, use, sell or import patented products without authorization granted by the patent owner as follows: 

• | Any person who uses, promises to sell, sells or imports any patented product or product directly obtained in accordance with the patented methods after such product is sold by the patent owner or by its licensed entity or individual;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any person who has manufactured an identical product, has used an identical method or has made necessary preparations for manufacture or use prior to the date of patent application and continues to manufacture such product or use such method only within the original scope;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any foreign transportation facility that temporarily passes through the territory, territorial waters or territorial airspace of China and uses the relevant patents in its devices and installations for its own needs in accordance with any agreement concluded between China and that country to which the foreign transportation facility belongs, or any international treaty to which both countries are party, or on the basis of the principle of reciprocity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any person who uses the relevant patents solely for the purposes of scientific research and experimentation; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any person who manufactures, uses or imports patented drug or patented medical equipment for the purpose of providing information required for administrative approval, or manufactures, uses or imports patented drugs or patented medical equipment for the abovementioned person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


However, if patented drugs are utilized on the ground of exemptions for unauthorized manufacture, use, sale or import of patented drugs prescribed in PRC Patent Law, such patented drugs cannot be manufactured, used, sold or imported for any commercial purposes without authorization granted by the patent owner. 
 Trade Secrets 
 According to the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on September 2, 1993, as amended on November 4, 2017 and on April 23, 2019 respectively, the term “trade 
 
-50- 

  secrets” refers to technical and business information that is unknown to the public that has utility and may create business interests or profits for its legal owners or holders, and is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. 
 Under the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, business persons are prohibited from infringing others’ trade secrets by: (1) obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by any unfair methods such as theft, bribery, intimidation, solicitation or coercion or any other illicit means; (2) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item (1) above; (3) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in confidence; or (4) instigating, inducing or assisting others to violate confidentiality obligations or to violate a rights holder’s requirements for keeping confidential and not disclosing, using or permitting others to use without authorization the trade secrets of the rights holder. If a third party knows or should have known of the fact that an employee or former employee of the right owner of trade secrets or any other entity or individual conducts any of the illegal acts above mentioned, but still accepts, publishes, uses or allows any other to use such secrets, such practice shall be deemed as infringement of trade secrets. The parties whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may petition for administrative corrections, and regulatory authorities may stop any illegal activities and fine infringing parties. 
 The measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written non-disclosure agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential. 
 Trademarks and Domain Names 
 Trademark. According to the Trademark Law of the PRC, promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC in August 1982, as amended in February 1993, October 2001, August 2013 and April 2019 and its implementation rules, the PRC Trademark Office of the National Intellectual Property Administration is responsible for the registration and administration of trademarks throughout the PRC. The Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration. 
 Domain Name. Domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in August 2017 and effective from November 2017. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is the main regulatory body responsible for the administration of PRC internet domain names.   PRC Regulation of Labor Protection 
 Under the Labor Law of the PRC, effective on January 1, 1995 and subsequently amended on August 27, 2009 and December 29, 2018, the PRC Employment Contract Law, effective on January 1, 2008 and subsequently amended on December 28, 2012 and the Implementing Regulations of the Employment Contract Law, effective on September 18, 2008, employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety to provide employees with occupational training to prevent occupational injury and employers are required to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions as requested by the Labor Contract Law of the PRC. 
 Pursuant to the Law of Manufacturing Safety of the PRC effective on November 1, 2002 and amended on August 27, 2009 and August 31, 2014, manufacturers must establish a comprehensive management system to ensure manufacturing safety in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, national standards and industrial standards. Manufacturers not meeting relevant legal requirements are not permitted to commence their manufacturing activities. 
 
-51- 

  Pursuant to the Administrative Measures Governing the Production Quality of Pharmaceutical Products effective on March 1, 2011, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are required to establish production safety and labor protection measures in connection with the operation of their manufacturing equipment and manufacturing process. 
 Pursuant to applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, including the Social Insurance Law which became effective on July 1, 2011 and amended on December 29, 2018, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Funds which became effective on January 22, 1999 and amended on March 24, 2019, Interim Measures concerning the Maternity Insurance of Employees which become effective on January 1, 1995, and the Regulations on Work-related Injury Insurance which became effective on January 1, 2004 and was subsequently amended on December 20, 2010, employers are required to contribute, on behalf of their employees, to a number of social security funds, including funds for basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance. If an employer fails to make social insurance contributions timely and in full, the social insurance collecting authority will order the employer to make up outstanding contributions within the prescribed time period and impose a late payment fee at the rate of 0.05% per day from the date on which the contribution becomes due. If such employer fails to make the overdue contributions within such time limit, the relevant administrative department may impose a fine equivalent to one to three times the overdue amount. 
 Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents 
 In July 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE Circular 37, and its implementation guidelines, which abolished and superseded the SAFE Circular 75. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 and its implementation guidelines, PRC residents (including PRC institutions and individuals) must register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment in an overseas special purpose vehicle, or SPV, directly established or indirectly controlled by PRC residents for the purposes of offshore investment and financing with their legally owned assets or interests in domestic enterprises, or their legally owned offshore assets or interests. Such PRC residents are also required to amend their registrations with SAFE when there is a change to the basic information of the SPV, such as changes of a PRC resident individual shareholder, the name or operating period of the SPV or when there is a significant change to the SPV, such as changes of the PRC individual resident’s increase or decrease of its capital contribution in the SPV, or any share transfer or exchange, merger, division of the SPV. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the Circular 37 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate, the capital inflow from the offshore entities and settlement of foreign exchange capital, and may also subject relevant onshore company or PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. 
Regulations Relating to Employee Stock Incentive Plan 
 In February 2012, State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rules. In accordance with the Stock Option Rules and relevant rules and regulations, PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain procedures. We and our employees who are PRC citizens or who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plan will be subject to such regulation. In addition, the SAT has issued circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, employees working in the PRC who exercise share options, or whose restricted shares vest, will be subject to PRC individual income tax, or the IIT. The PRC subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold IIT of those employees 
 
-52- 

  related to their share options or restricted shares. If the employees fail to pay, or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold, their IIT according to relevant laws, rules and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC government authorities. 
 Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution 
 Pursuant to the PRC Company Law and Foreign Investment Law, and Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors may freely remit into or out of China, in renminbi or any other foreign currency, their capital contributions, profits, capital gains, income from asset disposal, intellectual property royalties, lawfully acquired compensation, indemnity or liquidation income and so on within the territory of China. 
 In January 2017, the SAFE issued the Notice on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to Further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore entities, including the following: (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, domestic entities shall provide detailed explanations of the sources of capital and the utilization arrangements and board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment. 
 Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 
 The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008. Under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. 
 In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. SAFE also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or the SAFE Circular 19, which took effective and replaced SAFE Circular 142 on June 1, 2015. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows for the use of RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in China, the restrictions continue to apply as to foreign-invested enterprises’ use of the converted RMB for purposes beyond the business scope, for entrusted loans or for inter-company RMB loans. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account, or Circular 16, effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 or Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. 
 
-53- 

  In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which was subsequently amended in May 2015. It substantially simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts (e.g., pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts), the reinvestment of lawful incomes derived by foreign investors in China (e.g. profit, proceeds of equity transfer, capital reduction, liquidation and early repatriation of investment), and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as a result of capital reduction, liquidation, early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign-invested enterprise no longer require SAFE approval, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible before. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. 
 In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which took effect on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 delegates the authority to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with the inbound and outbound direct investment under relevant SAFE rules to certain banks and therefore further simplifies the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investment. 
 Other PRC National- and Provincial-Level Laws and Regulations 
 We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties. These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future. 
 We also comply with numerous additional national and provincial laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control in all material aspects. We believe that we are currently in compliance with these laws and regulations in material aspects; however, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 Commercialization 
 We believe that the scale and sophistication of our commercial operation is crucial to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial financial and management resources to build-out our commercial infrastructure and to recruit and train sufficient additional qualified marketing, sales and other personnel in support of the sales of our commercialized products. 
 As of January 31, 2021, our commercialization team consisted of approximately 600 sales and marketing staff, covering major medical centers across Greater China. Our commercialization team has a proven track record and experience from leading oncology multinational pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca, Roche, Novartis and BMS in Greater China. Our commercial team has capabilities that cover the product sales cycle, including medical affairs, market access, and distributor management. We tailor our commercialization 
 
-54- 

  strategies according to our individual products and their different market potential to drive product launch. For ZEJULA, we plan to increase market penetration in China and substantially increase our hospital coverage therein by 2021. To implement this commercial strategy, we plan to increase the number of sales representatives in our ZEJULA sales team to facilitate greater product access for more patients. For Optune, we plan to increase brand awareness in China and provide more post-launch product support services for patients. To implement this commercial strategy, we plan to increase the number of device support staff to build up our Optune product service team. We are also in the process of building a support team for QINLOCK which was granted Priority Review by the NMPA in 2020 for our NDA. In addition, in March 2020, we entered into a contract sales agreement with Huizheng (Shanghai) Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., HanHui, a pharmaceutical company based in China with a commercial presence in antibiotics. The agreement allows us to use HanHui’s existing infrastructure for the potential future commercial launch of NUZYRA in Greater China. 
 Our Distribution Channel 
 We rely on independent third-party distributors in Greater China to sell our commercialized products, which is consistent with the pharmaceutical industry norm. We believe that distributors help us effectively execute our marketing strategies specifically tailored to each geographical location and the hospitals located within their distribution territories across China. During 2020, after we launched ZEJULA and Optune in China, we started to engage distributors. Our commercial relationship with the distributors we use is a seller and buyer relationship. Accordingly, we recognize revenue when our products are delivered to and accepted by the distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount of revenue generated from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 48.6% and 85.0% of our total revenue, respectively. 
 We select distributors based on their business qualifications and distribution capabilities, such as distribution network coverage, quality, number of personnel, cash flow conditions, creditworthiness, logistics, compliance standard and past performance, and their capacity for customer management. We offer rebates to our distributors, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice. We retain no ownership control over the products sold to our distributors, and all significant risks (including inventory risks) and rewards associated with the products are generally transferred to the distributors upon delivery to and acceptance by the distributors. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY 
 Our Manufacturing Facilities 
 We currently operate two manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, which support the clinical and commercialized production of certain of our products and product candidates, including ZEJULA. We do not manufacture Optune; instead, we source Optune from our licensor, Novocure. In early 2017, we built a cGMP-compliant small molecule facility in Suzhou capable of supporting clinical and commercial production. The production capacity of our small molecule manufacturing facility is up to 50 million units per year for both commercial oral tablets and capsules. In 2018, we completed construction of a large molecule facility in Suzhou using GE Healthcare FlexFactory platform technology capable of supporting the clinical production of our product candidates. The annual production capacity of our large molecule manufacturing capacity is up to 12 to 18 200L or 1000L clinical batches, respectively. We are investing in the expansion of our large molecule manufacturing facility in anticipation of the increased activities of our internally developed pipeline. Although we expect our two manufacturing facilities to be able to satisfy the commercial as well as clinical needs and support the growth of our business in the near future, we acquired land use rights in Suzhou that can be used to expand our manufacturing and research needs in the future. We believe that possessing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities presents benefits, which include maintaining better control over the quality and compliance of our operations with increasingly stringent industry regulations. See “Risk Factors—We have limited experience manufacturing our products and product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale.” 
 Our two manufacturing facilities feature an oral solid dosage and a biological processing/formulation production lines and are designed to comply with both the PRC and PIC/S drug manufacturing standards. The 
 
-55- 

  facilities cover the entire production process from mixing, roller compression, tableting to bottling. We procure our manufacturing equipment from leading domestic and international suppliers. We have acquired manufacturing licenses for both oral solid dosage and biological facilities, and are in the process of applying for a Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) manufacturing license. We have passed an onsite inspection by the NMPA for ZEJULA, our first commercialized product. We are or will be dependent on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of certain of our products and product candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if any of these third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices, our business could be harmed. As of December 31, 2020, our manufacturing team consisted of approximately 60 employees. 
 Contract Manufacturing Organizations 
 We outsource to a limited number of external CMOs the production of some product substances and products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical, clinical and commercial requirements of our products and product candidates. By outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing activities, we can increase our focus on core areas of competence such as product candidate development, commercialization and research. We have adopted procedures to ensure that the production qualifications, facilities and processes of our third-party CMOs comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and our internal guidelines. We select our CMOs by taking into account a number of factors, including their qualifications, relevant expertise, production capacity, geographic proximity, reputation, track record, product quality, reliability in meeting delivery schedules and terms offered by such CMOs. The CMOs with which we contract provide services to us on a short-term and project-by-project basis. Our agreements with the CMOs typically specify requirements, including, but not limited to, product quality or service details, technical standards or methods, delivery terms, agreed price and payment and product inspection and acceptance criteria. The CMOs procure the necessary raw materials themselves. 
Suppliers 
 Our suppliers consist primarily of (i) third party licensors from which we obtained license rights in respect of our in-licensed products and drug candidates; (ii) selected CROs; and (iii) suppliers of other raw materials for our clinical trial activities. 
 We obtain raw materials for our clinical trial activities from multiple suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, a risk exists that an interruption to supplies would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. While we do experience price fluctuations associated with our raw materials, we have not experienced any material disruptions in the supply of these raw materials in the past. In addition, we have suppliers across the world and do not rely exclusively on the imports from the suppliers in the United States. 
COMPETITION 
 Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. 
 We believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and 
 
-56- 

  development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the commercial expertise to effectively market our products. 
 Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position. 
 The introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. 
 We also face increased competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products, which may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenues in a short period of time. 
 We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment. 
 Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below in “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report. 
 INSURANCE 
 We maintain insurance policies that are required under Chinese laws and regulations as well as based on our assessment of our operational needs and industry practice. We maintain liability insurance for certain clinical trials, which covers the patient human clinical trial liabilities such as bodily injury, product liability insurance, general insurance policies covering property loss due to accidents or natural disasters and D&O insurance. We do not maintain insurance to cover intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

Our management executive team is comprised of our CEO and her direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets—particularly our diversity, capability development and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent. Across our broader population, approximately 58% of full-time employees are women. We have programs in place to attract and retain talent, including stock-based compensation and cash performance awards as well as tuition support for technical and other training. We also have a performance management and talent development process in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees. 
 We provide formal and comprehensive company-level and department-level training to our new employees followed by on-the-job training. We also provide training and development programs to our employees from time to time to ensure their awareness and compliance with our various policies and procedures. Given our emphasis on operating a fully-integrated platform for our product candidate development processes, some of the training is conducted jointly by different groups and departments serving different functions but working with or supporting each other in our day-to-day operations. 
 As required under Chinese regulations, we participate in housing fund and various employee social security plans that are organized by applicable local municipal and provincial governments, including housing, pension, medical, work-related injury, maternity and unemployment benefit plans, under which we make contributions at specified percentages of the salaries of our employees. 
 None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees. We have not experienced any material labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations. 
 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
 We have our own independent quality control system and devote significant attention to quality control for the designing, manufacturing and testing of our drug candidates. We have established a strict quality control system in accordance with NMPA regulations. We monitor our operations in real time throughout the entire production process, from inspection of raw and auxiliary materials, to manufacture and delivery of finished products to clinical testing at hospitals. Our quality assurance team is also responsible for ensuring that we are in

 RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 We have adopted a consolidated risk management methodology and program which sets out a risk management framework to identify, assess, evaluate and monitor key risks associated with our strategic objectives on an on-going basis. Our Audit Committee, and ultimately our Directors, supervise the implementation of our risk management programs. Risks identified by management will be analyzed on the basis of likelihood and impact and will be properly followed up and mitigated and rectified by management and reported to our Directors. 
 The following key principles outline our approach to risk management and internal control:

 Investment Risk Management 
 We have an investment policy that is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In accordance with that policy, we engage in short-term investments with surplus cash on hand. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of time deposits. Our primary objective of short-term investment is to preserve principal and increase liquidity without significantly increasing risks. Under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, our finance department is responsible for managing our short-term investment activities. 
 
-59- 

  Before making any investment proposal, our finance department will assess our cash flow levels, operational needs and capital expenditures. We operate under our investment policy, which provides the guidelines and specific instructions on the investment of our funds. 
 Our investment strategy aims to minimize risks by reasonably and conservatively matching the maturities of the portfolio to anticipated operating cash needs. We make our investment decisions on a case-by-case basis after thoroughly considering a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the macro-economic environment, general market conditions and the expected profit or potential loss of the investment. Our portfolio to date has been required to hold only instruments with an effective final maturity of twelve months or less, with effective final maturity being defined as the obligation of the issuer to repay principal and interest. Under our investment policy, we are prohibited from investing in high risk products and the proposed investment must not interfere with our business operations or capital expenditures. We may invest in time deposits, consistent with our investment policy, when we believe it is prudent to do so. 
 We believe that our internal investment policy and the related risk management mechanisms are adequate. As of December 31, 2020, our investment decisions did not deviate from our investment policy.
