Item 1. Business
The Company
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located at 1000 Six PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-5479, telephone number (412) 394-2800, Internet website address www.atimetals.com. Our Internet website and the content contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to “Allegheny Technologies,” “ATI,” the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “our” and “us” and similar terms mean Allegheny Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
Our Business
ATI’s strategic vision is to be an aligned and integrated specialty materials and components company, solving the world’s challenges through materials science. Our strategies target the products and global growth markets that require and value ATI’s technical and manufacturing capabilities. Our largest markets are aerospace & defense, representing approximately 50% of total sales, led by products for jet engines. Additionally, we have a strong presence in the energy markets, including oil & gas, downstream processing, and specialty energy. In aggregate, these markets represent about 70% of our revenue. ATI is a market leader in manufacturing differentiated products that require our materials science capabilities and unique process technologies, including our new product development competence.
Effective January 1, 2020, we began operating under two revised business segments: High Performance Materials & Components (HPMC) and Advanced Alloys & Solutions (AA&S). All segment reporting information for 2020 and prior periods in this Form 10-K reflect these two revised business segments. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2020, the Company changed its segment performance measure from segment operating profit to segment EBITDA, based on internal reporting changes. Prior period results are presented using the new performance measure. The measure of segment EBITDA is defined in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes segment EBITDA, as defined, provides an appropriate measure of controllable operating results at the business segment level.
HPMC is comprised of the Specialty Materials and Forged Products businesses, as well as our ATI Europe distribution operations. The revised HPMC segment intensifies its primary focus on maximizing aero-engine materials and components growth, with approximately 80% of its revenue derived from the aerospace & defense markets and nearly half of its revenue from products for commercial jet engines. Commercial aerospace products have been the main source of sales and EBITDA growth for HPMC over the last few years, and are expected to continue to drive HPMC and overall ATI results for the next several years as demand from these markets recovers from reduced 2020 levels resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Other major HPMC end markets include medical and energy. HPMC produces a wide range of high performance materials, and components, and advanced metallic powder alloys made from titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, and a variety of other specialty materials. Capabilities range from cast/wrought and powder alloy development to final production of highly engineered finished components, including those used for next-generation jet engine forgings and 3D-printed aerospace products.
The new AA&S segment combines our Specialty Alloys & Components (SAC) business, including the primary titanium operations in Richland, WA and Albany, OR, with ATI’s former Flat Rolled Products (FRP) business segment, which included the FRP business, consisting of the Specialty Rolled Products and Standard Stainless Sheet Products product lines, the 60%-owned Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL) joint venture, and the Uniti LLC and Allegheny & Tsingshan Stainless (A&T Stainless) 50%-owned joint ventures that are reported in AA&S segment results under the equity method of accounting. AA&S is focused on delivering high-value flat products primarily to the energy, aerospace, and defense end-markets, which comprise approximately 50% of its revenue. AA&S was created to align melting technologies with hot-rolling capabilities to produce products with faster flow times and lower costs. Financial results of aerospace-grade titanium plate products also transferred from HPMC to AA&S effective January 1, 2020. Other important end markets for AA&S include automotive and electronics. AA&S produces nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium-based alloys, and stainless products in a variety of forms including plate, sheet, and strip products.
On December 2, 2020, we announced a strategic repositioning of our FRP business within the AA&S segment, with a focus of increasing emphasis on the specialty rolled products portion of its product portfolio, which comprise titanium-based alloys including aerospace-grade titanium plate products, nickel-based alloys, and stainless products with more differentiated characteristics for specialty applications, including thin-gauge Precision Rolled Strip® (PRS). As part of this strategic realignment, we intend to cease production of standard stainless sheet products over approximately a one-year period, significantly reducing the operating levels of the Brackenridge, PA operations, including the Hot-Rolling & Processing Facility (HRPF), and close various downstream finishing operations that are part of the standard stainless sheet flow path.
Strategic end-use markets for our products include:
Aerospace & Defense. We are a world leader in the production of specialty materials and components for both commercial and military jet engines and airframes supporting customer needs for initial build requirements and for spare parts. Through alloy development, internal growth efforts, and long-term supply agreements on current and next-generation jet engines and airframes, we are well-positioned with a fully qualified asset base to meet the expected return to multi-year demand growth from the commercial aerospace market as business conditions impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic recover to more normal levels.
Typical aerospace applications for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and advanced metallic powders include jet engine shafts, discs, blades, vanes, rings and casings. Nickel-based alloys and superalloys remain extremely strong at high temperatures and resist degradation under extreme conditions. The next-generation jet engines use advanced nickel-based superalloys and metallic powder alloys due to increased fuel efficiency requirements that require hotter-burning engines. Our specialty materials are also used in the manufacture of aircraft landing gear and structural components.
We are a global industry leader in isothermal and hot-die forging technologies for advanced aerospace components. Capital investments for our fourth iso-thermal press and heat-treating capacity expansion at our Iso-Thermal Forging Center of Excellence in Cudahy, WI, which began in 2018, continued through 2020. We produce highly sophisticated components that have differing mechanical properties across a single product unit and are highly-resistant to fatigue and temperature effects. Our precision forgings are used for jet engine components, structural components for aircraft, helicopters, space propulsion, and other demanding applications. ATI provides a full range of post-production inspection and machining with the certified quality needed to meet demanding application requirements.
Products and components made from titanium and titanium-based alloys, such as jet engine components including blades, vanes, and discs, and airframe components such as structural members, landing gears, and hydraulic systems, are critical in aerospace applications. These materials and components possess an extraordinary combination of properties that help to increase jet engine fuel efficiency and product longevity, including superior strength-to-weight ratios, elevated temperature resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and extreme corrosion resistance.
Our specialty materials and components for defense applications include naval nuclear products, military jet engines, fixed wing and rotorcraft products, and armor applications. We expect to increase our sales in government defense applications in future years, and in 2019, we announced the expansion and 6.5-year extension of our long-term agreement (LTA) with BWX Technologies to supply materials for the manufacture of naval nuclear components.
We continuously seek to develop and manufacture innovative new alloys to better serve the needs of the aerospace & defense markets. For example, ATI 718Plus® nickel-based superalloy, Rene 65 near-powder superalloy, and our powder alloys have won significant share in the current and next-generation jet engines. ATI’s metallic powder technology delivers alloy compositions and refined microstructures that offer increased performance and longer useful lives in high-temperature aerospace environments as well as improving the efficiency of jet engines. Our metallic powder products deliver the most uniform grain structure achievable in near-net shapes. We continue to increase our production capacity for advanced metallic powders for use in next-generation aerospace products, including additive manufacturing applications.
Energy. This includes oil & gas, downstream processing, and specialty energy markets.
The environments in which oil & gas can be found in commercial quantities have become more challenging, involving deep offshore wells, high pressure and high temperature conditions in sour wells and unconventional sources. These challenging offshore environments are located further off the continental shelf, including locations in arctic and tropical waters where drilling is more difficult than previously-sourced locations. We enable our customers’ success in these applications by developing and producing specialty materials for equipment that can operate for up to 30 years in these harsh environments.
Both of our business segments produce specialty materials that are critical to the oil & gas industry. Our specialty materials, including nickel-based alloys, duplex alloys and other specialty alloys, have the strength and corrosion-resistant properties necessary to meet these challenging operating conditions.
Our specialty materials are widely used in the global electrical power generation and distribution industries. We believe clean energy needs, expanding environmental policies and the electrification of developing countries will continue to drive demand for our specialty materials and products for use in these industries over the long term.
For electrical power generation, our specialty materials, including corrosion-resistant alloys (CRAs), are used in nuclear, natural gas and other fuel source applications. Our CRAs are used for pipe, tube, and heat exchanger applications in water systems and in pollution control scrubbers. Our CRAs are also used in water systems, fuel cladding components, and process equipment for nuclear power plants. For nuclear power plants, we are an industry pioneer in producing nuclear reactor fuel cladding and structural components utilizing zirconium and hafnium alloys. We are a technology leader for large diameter components used 
in natural gas land-based turbines for power generation. Our alloys are also used for alternative energy generation, in solar, fuel cell and geothermal applications.
Medical. ATI’s advanced specialty materials are used in medical device products that enhance the quality of people’s lives around the world.
Manufacturers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices rely on our niobium superconducting wire to help produce electromagnetic fields that allow physicians to safely scan the body’s soft tissue. We have a joint technology development agreement with Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies to advance state-of-the-art niobium-based superconductors, including those used in MRI magnets for the medical industry, and preclinical MRI magnets used in the life-science tools industry.
Our specialty alloys are used for replacement knees, hips and other prosthetic devices. The use of our alloys in these replacement devices offer the potential of longer product lifespans versus previous implant generations.
Our biocompatible nickel-titanium shape memory alloy is used for stents to support collapsed or clogged blood vessels. Reduced in diameter for insertion, these stents expand post-implant to the original tube-like shape due to the metal’s superelasticity. In addition, our ultra fine diameter (0.002 inch/0.051 mm) titanium wire is used for screens to prevent blood clots from entering critical areas of the body.
Electronics. ATI’s materials perform a variety of important roles in the growing consumer electronics market. Nickel alloys and PRS from FRP and our STAL joint venture support computers and smart phones. The magnetic properties of nickel alloys are used in relay cores, magnets and magnetic shielding, while their thermal expansion is useful in glass-to-metal sealing applications such as monitors. PRS is selected for electronics and communications applications based on corrosion resistance, strength, wear resistance, electrical resistivity or thermal expansion.
In addition, metal precursors – which use chemicals produced by ATI – have a variety of important applications in consumer and industrial electronics.
Business Segments
Our two business segments accounted for the following percentages of total revenues of $2.98 billion, $4.12 billion, and $4.05 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
High Performance Materials & Components | 39 | % | | 48 | % | 49 | %
Advanced Alloys & Solutions | 61 | % | | 52 | % | 51 | %

Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
High Performance Materials & Components Segment
Our HPMC segment produces a wide range of high performance specialty materials, parts and components for several major end markets, including aerospace & defense, medical, and energy. 81% of the HPMC segment’s 2020 revenues were derived from the aerospace & defense markets. Demand for our products is driven primarily by the commercial aerospace cycle. Large aircraft and jet engines are manufactured by a small number of companies, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S. (an Airbus Group company) including the former operations of Bombardier Aerospace, and Embraer (Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica S.A.) for airframes, and GE Aviation (a division of General Electric Company), Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney (a division of Raytheon Technologies Corporation), Snecma (SAFRAN Group), and various joint ventures that manufacture jet engines. These companies, and their suppliers, form a substantial part of our customer base in this business segment. We have LTAs in place with most major aerospace market OEMs. The loss of one or more of our customers in the aerospace & defense markets could have a material adverse effect on ATI’s results of operations and financial condition (see Item 1A. Risk Factors).
Our products are manufactured from a wide range of advanced materials including metallic powder alloys, made from nickel-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, and a variety of other specialty materials. These materials are made into a variety of product forms that include precision forgings, machined parts and others. We are integrated across these alloy systems in melt, forging, finishing, and machining processes. Most of the products in this segment are sold directly to end-use customers, and a substantial portion of our HPMC segment products are sold under multi-year agreements.
Principal competitors in the HPMC segment include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, and precision forgings through its ownership of Precision Castparts Corporation and subsidiaries; Howmet Aerospace Inc., for titanium and titanium-based alloys; Carpenter Technology Corporation for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys; VSMPO-AVISMA for titanium and titanium-based alloys; and Aubert & Duval for precision forgings.
Advanced Alloys & Solutions Segment
Our AA&S segment produces nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, and stainless steel in a variety of forms including plate, sheet, and PRS products. The major end markets for our flat rolled products are energy, aerospace & defense, automotive, and electronics. The operations in this segment include our FRP business, consisting of the Specialty Rolled Products and Standard Stainless Sheet Products product lines, our SAC business, including the primary titanium operations in Richland, WA and Albany, OR and the STAL PRS joint venture in China, in which we hold a 60% interest. Segment results also include our 50% interest in the Uniti industrial titanium joint venture and our 50% interest in A&T Stainless.
Significant global overcapacity for stainless flat-rolled products has intensified the price competition in the AA&S segment over the last several years, despite various anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed by the United States government in various forms since 1999. On December 2, 2020, we announced a strategic repositioning of our FRP business, which includes exiting standard stainless sheet products, streamlining the production footprint of the AA&S segment and making certain capital investments to increase its focus on higher-margin products and its aerospace & defense end markets.  Additionally, in 2020 we indefinitely idled the manufacturing operations of the A&T Stainless joint venture due to repeated denials by the U.S. Department of Commerce for exemptions from Section 232 tariffs, which impose a 25% tariff on imported semi-finished stainless slab products from Indonesia.
Nickel-based alloys, titanium, and stainless sheet products are used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. In 2020, approximately 65% of our stainless sheet products by volume were sold to independent service centers, which have slitting, cutting or other processing facilities, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
PRS products, which are under 0.015 inches thick, are used by customers to fabricate a variety of products primarily in the automotive and electronics markets. In 2020, approximately 90% of these products by volume were sold directly to end-use customers or through our own distribution network, with the remainder sold to independent service centers. In 2018, we completed the construction of our third PRS manufacturing facility at our STAL PRS joint venture in China.
Nickel-based alloy, titanium, and stainless plate products are primarily used in aerospace & defense, and corrosion and industrial markets. In 2020, approximately 60% of our plate products by volume were sold to independent service centers, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
Competitors for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys include Haynes International and VDM Metals GmbH, a subsidiary of Acerinox S.A. Competition in the AA&S segment includes domestic stainless competitors North American Stainless, a subsidiary of Acerinox S.A., Outokumpu Stainless USA, LLC, and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., as well as imports from numerous foreign producers, including Aperam, based in Europe.
We continue efforts toward improving the capacity utilization of our HRPF for carbon steel hot-rolling third-party conversion services.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Substantially all raw materials and supplies required in the manufacture of our products are available from more than one supplier, and the sources and availability of raw materials essential to our businesses are currently adequate. The principal raw materials we use in the production of our specialty materials are scrap (including iron-, nickel-, chromium-, titanium-, and molybdenum-bearing scrap), nickel, titanium sponge, zirconium sand and sponge, ferrochromium, ferrosilicon, molybdenum and molybdenum alloys, manganese and manganese alloys, cobalt, niobium, vanadium and other alloying materials. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time to time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials.
Over the last several years, significant global capacity has been added to produce titanium sponge, which is a key raw material used to produce ATI’s titanium products. ATI has entered into long-term cost competitive supply agreements with several producers of premium-grade and standard-grade titanium sponge.
Other raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, and ferrochromium, are available to us and our specialty materials industry competitors primarily from foreign sources. Some of these foreign sources are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions, which could disrupt supplies or affect the price of these materials.
We purchase our nickel requirements principally from producers in Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and the Dominican Republic. Zirconium raw materials are primarily purchased from the United States and China. Cobalt is purchased primarily from producers in Canada. More than 80% of the world’s reserves of ferrochromium are located in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Albania, and Kazakhstan. Niobium is purchased principally from producers in Brazil, and our titanium sponge comes from sources in Japan and Kazakhstan.
Certain key supplies used in melting and other processing operations, such as graphite electrodes and industrial gases including helium and argon, are from time-to-time limited in availability and may be subject to significant price inflation. We enter into long-term supply contracts where possible to ensure an adequate supply of these items, however, overall industry shortages may impact our operations and scheduling.
Export Sales and Foreign Operations
International sales represent approximately 40% of our total annual sales, with direct export sales by our U.S.-based operations to customers in foreign countries accounting for approximately 30% of our total sales. Our overseas sales, marketing and distribution efforts are aided by our international marketing and distribution offices, ATI Europe, ATI Europe Distribution, and ATI Asia, or by independent representatives at various locations throughout the world. We believe that at least 50% of ATI’s 2020 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers.
Our HPMC segment has manufacturing capabilities for melting, remelting, forging and finishing nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in the United Kingdom, and manufacturing capabilities for precision forging and machining in Poland, primarily serving the aerospace, construction & mining and transportation markets. Within our AA&S segment, our STAL joint venture in the People’s Republic of China produces PRS products, which enables us to offer these products more effectively to markets in China and other Asian countries. Our Uniti LLC joint venture allows us to offer titanium products to global industrial markets more effectively.
Backlog, Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019. We expect that approximately 75% of confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2020 will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2021. Our HPMC segment’s backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2019. We expect that approximately 70% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2020 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2021. Our AA&S segment’s backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $0.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and $0.5 billion at December 31, 2019. We expect that approximately 95% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2020 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2021.
Demand for our products is cyclical over longer periods because specialty materials customers operate in cyclical industries and are subject to changes in general economic conditions and other factors both external and internal to those industries. The HPMC segment typically experiences modest seasonal weakness in the third quarter of each fiscal year due to many European customers, particularly in the aerospace supply chain, taking plant outages during this summer period. ATI also typically performs corresponding annual preventative maintenance outages at several facilities during this same period.
Cybersecurity
The Company recognizes the increasing significance that cybersecurity has to our operations and the success of our business and the need to continually assess cybersecurity risk and evolve our response in the face of a rapidly and ever-changing environment. We appointed a Chief Digital and Information Officer in 2019 and, to enhance an already comprehensive cybersecurity program, appointed a Chief Information Security Officer to lead our efforts to address and mitigate digital technology risks in partnership with ATI’s business leaders.
In 2020, the need to ensure cybersecurity while enabling a comprehensive and highly reliable remote working environment for a significant portion of our workforce was a central component of our response to the COVID-19. Throughout 2020, special attention was and continues to be given to improving and implementing Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification controls in support of protecting ATI’s technology and customer data.
Additionally, we have a robust Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan in place which provides a documented framework for handling high severity security incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of the Company. We routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and management level. We incorporate external expertise and reviews in all aspects of our program, and all personnel receive regular cybersecurity awareness training.
As part of its program of regular oversight, the Company’s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing ATI’s cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from the Chief Digital and Information Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer on ATI’s cybersecurity risk profile and enterprise cybersecurity program.
Research, Development and Technical Services
We believe that our research and development capabilities give ATI an advantage in developing new products and manufacturing processes that contribute to the long-term profitable growth potential of our businesses. We conduct research 
and development at our various operating locations both for our own account and, on a limited basis, for customers on a contract basis. Research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 included the following:

(In millions) | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Company-Funded: | | | | | 
High Performance Materials & Components | $ | 7.7 | | | $ | 8.2 | | $ | 12.0
Advanced Alloys & Solutions | 5.3 | | | 7.4 | | | 8.2

Our research, development and technical service activities are closely interrelated and are directed toward development of new products, improvement of existing products, cost reduction, process improvement and control, quality assurance and control, development of new manufacturing methods, and improvement of existing manufacturing methods. The increased activity in 2019 and 2018 was largely related to materials and manufacturing methods for products supporting the aerospace & defense markets. The decline in 2020 reflects the weakened market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We own hundreds of United States patents, many of which are also filed under the patent laws of other nations. Although these patents, as well as our numerous trademarks, technical information, license agreements, and other intellectual property, have been and are expected to be of value, we believe that the loss of any single such item or technically related group of such items would not materially affect the conduct of our business.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites.
We consider environmental compliance to be an integral part of our operations. We have a comprehensive environmental management and reporting program that focuses on compliance with applicable federal, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Each operating company has an environmental management system that includes mechanisms for regularly evaluating environmental compliance and managing changes in business operations while assessing environmental impact.
Human Capital Resources
We have approximately 6,500 active employees, of which approximately 20% are located outside the United States. Approximately 40% of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), predominantly with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied & Industrial Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (USW). The Company’s CBA with the USW involving approximately 1,100 active full-time represented employees located primarily within the AA&S segment operations expired on February 29, 2020. On March 25, 2020, the Company announced an agreement with the USW that extended the terms of the expired CBA for one year, to February 28, 2021.
We believe that world-class leadership and fostering a culture that enables us to build and grow a talented engaged team through career development and opportunities is foundational to our vision. We recognize that attracting, retaining and developing members of our workforce is a key to the success and sustainability of our business.
We continuously strive to cultivate and support a highly engaged and productive workforce. As a result, management focuses on a number of human capital measures and objectives, which include the following:
Talent Acquisition: We partner closely with a targeted number of colleges and universities specifically known for programs that are relevant to our business in order to identify materials science, STEM expertise and other relevant talent, and have developed similar partnerships with high schools and relevant trade schools. In addition, we engage with external professional recruiting firms to enhance our recruiting efforts for key positions. We utilize pre-employment assessment tools to identify qualified candidates who we believe would adapt well to our culture and be most suited to a particular opportunity. We are also actively engaged with campus and professional diversity groups. We pride ourselves on our ability to attract and retain U.S. 
military veterans, who comprise approximately 5% of our leadership team and approximately 9% of our total employee population as of the end of 2020.
Professional Development: We offer a number of programs to our employees intended to support development of the skills each employee needs for success in his or her current position and for future career growth. One of these programs is our Global Leadership Development Program, our Company-wide, flagship program designed to build the skills of our employees across each level of leadership. We also have an Early Career Leadership Development Program, a five-year program designed for high-potential and motivated college graduates designed to prepare our future leaders.
Engagement and Performance Management: We actively seek opportunities for regular engagement and communication by our CEO and other senior executive leaders with our broader employee population. Annually, we conduct a confidential company-wide employee engagement survey with feedback from these surveys reviewed with our Board and used to develop and refine other aspects of our overall human capital management and other growth strategies. We also maintain a robust annual performance management process across the organization.
Succession Planning: We maintain a formal succession planning process and career mapping framework that is designed to work in connection with our performance management processes and ensure a systematic and ongoing dialog regarding career development and succession planning at both the individual employee level and more broadly at an enterprise level.
Retention: An output of our talent assessment process is a retention toolkit. This toolkit is designed to use both quantitative and qualitative inputs along with predictive analytics to inform our retention strategies.
Health & Safety: Safety is one of our core values. We strive for a Zero Injury Culture committed to the safety of our people, our products, and the communities in which we operate. Our 2020 OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate was 0.87 per 200,000 hours and our Lost Time Case Rate was 0.21 per 200,000 hours, which we believe to be competitive with world-class performance for our industry. Also, at the end of 2020, 82% of ATI Operations are ISO 18001 or OSHAS 45001 certified. Our goal is to have every operation certified to ISO 18001 or OSHAS 45001 standards by the end of 2022.
Pandemic Response: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ATI formed a COVID-19 task force to respond to the various government orders, guidance, and issues facing our business and employees. Our operations are critical to ongoing demands and requirements of our customers and as an essential business, we continued to operate while many businesses were ordered to close. By quickly implementing plans and protocols for keeping our employees safe, we have had no widespread infection among our employees in any of our global locations.
Diversity & Inclusion: We recognize the benefits and importance of diversity amongst our board and management. Three of our 12 current board members, including our Board Chair, are women, and one member of our Board is an ethnic minority. Additionally, two of our eight Executive Council members are women- our Executive Vice President, HPMC and AA&S Segments and our Chief Human Resources Officer. We have adopted recruitment strategies to provide outreach and sourcing of diverse candidates. One of these strategies is to ensure that one-third of the candidate slate is diverse.
Governance: Our Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics address employment and workplace safety laws, and also describe our commitment to equal opportunity and fair treatment of employees.
