Precision Agriculture
    We offer smart solutions to the farmer to optimize farming performance, while improving ease of use. Our strategy is based upon an open approach to data management leveraging existing solutions offered by partnering with industry leaders and while integrating our products and innovation. We provide essential added value to dealers and service providers that helps farmers improve uptime, machine and yield optimization, mixed fleet optimization and decision support, with critical data privacy choices and convenient mobile tools that offer access to data and information. These products ultimately result in reduced waste and increased profitability for the farmer. Our precision agriculture solutions are based on connectivity, automation and digitalization and include satellite-based steering, field data collection, product self-adjustment, yield-mapping and telemetry-based fleet management systems. Our Fuse® and other precision agriculture solutions support our products, brands and the aftermarket with a comprehensive and customizable suite of solutions, enabling farmers to make individual, data-based decisions in order to reduce costs and maximize efficiency, yields and profitability. A significant number of these technologies are developed by third parties and are integrated into our products. We believe that these products and related devices are highly valued by professional farmers globally and are integral to the current and future growth of our equipment sales and revenues.
Market Conditions
    Demand for agricultural equipment is cyclical, influenced by, among other things, farm income, farm land values, weather conditions, the demand for agricultural commodities, commodity and protein prices and general economic conditions, as well as government policies and subsidies. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on global crop production. Most farm operations, which generally have been deemed essential, operated at normal levels. However, the consumption of grain for food, fuel and livestock feed was negatively impacted by the economic constraints caused by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, grain consumption started to recover, consistent with improving economic activities and increased grain exports to China, thus reducing forecasts for ending grain inventories, and raising soft commodity prices. Consequently, global industry demand for farm equipment was mixed during 2020 but improved in the second half of the year across major markets. Farm income, which is a function of commodity and protein prices, crop yields, and government support, will continue to be a key factor in the level of industry demand.
2020 Compared to 2019 Financial Highlights
    Net income attributable to AGCO Corporation and subsidiaries for 2020 was $427.1 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, compared to $125.2 million, or $1.63 per diluted share for 2019.
    Net sales for 2020 were approximately $9,149.7 million, or 1.2% higher than 2019, primarily due to increased sales volumes in our South American region, partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Net sales were impacted by reduced production volumes caused by component availability and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, but recovered in the second half of the year resulting from more normalized production and improved industry demand. Income from operations was $599.7 million in 2020 compared to $348.1 million in 2019. The increase in income from operations during 2020 was primarily the result of improved margins which benefited from positive pricing impacts, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives as compared to prior year. In addition, our 2019 income from operations included approximately $176.6 million of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 related to our grain storage and protein production systems operations in our Europe/Middle East region. See “Financial Highlights” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information. 
Competition
    The agricultural industry is highly competitive. We compete with several large national and international full-line suppliers, as well as numerous short-line and specialty manufacturers with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. Our two principal competitors on a worldwide basis are Deere & Company and CNH Industrial N.V. We have regional competitors around the world that have significant market share in a single country or a group of countries.
    We believe several key factors influence a buyer’s choice of farm equipment, including the strength and quality of a company’s dealers, the quality and pricing of products, dealer or brand loyalty, product availability, terms of financing and customer service. See “Marketing and Distribution” for additional information.
Marketing and Distribution
Dealers and Distributors
    We distribute products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors. Our dealers are responsible for retail sales of equipment to end users and after-sales service and support. Our distributors may sell our product through networks of dealers supported by the distributors, and our distributors also may directly market our products and provide customer service support. Our sales are not dependent on any specific dealer, distributor or group of dealers. In some countries, we utilize associates and licensees to provide a distribution channel for our products and a source of low-cost production for certain products.

 | Independent Dealers and Distributors | Percent of Net Sales(1)
Geographical Region | 2020 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Europe | 785 | 57 | % | | 58 | % | 57 | %
North America | 1,820 | 24 | % | | 24 | % | 23 | %
South America | 245 | 9 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %
Rest of World (2) | 400 | 10 | % | | 9 | % | 9 | %

____________________________________

(2) Consists of approximately 60 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.
Dealer Support and Supervision
    We believe that one of the most important criteria affecting a farmer’s decision to purchase a particular brand of equipment is the quality of the dealer who sells and services the equipment. We support our dealers in order to improve the quality of our dealer network. We monitor each dealer’s performance and profitability and establish programs that focus on continuous dealer improvement. Our dealers generally have sales territories for which they are responsible.
    We believe that our ability to offer our dealers a full product line of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts, as well as our ongoing dealer training and support programs focusing on business and inventory management, sales, marketing, warranty and servicing matters and products, helps ensure the vitality and increase the competitiveness of our dealer network. We also maintain dealer advisory groups to obtain dealer feedback on our operations.
    We provide our dealers with volume sales incentives, demonstration programs and other advertising support to assist sales. We design our sales programs, including retail financing incentives, and our policies for maintaining parts and service availability with extensive product warranties to enhance our dealers’ competitive position.
Resources
Manufacturing and Assembly
    We manufacture and assemble our products in 43 locations worldwide, including four locations where we operate joint ventures. Our locations are intended to optimize capacity, technology and local costs. Furthermore, we continue to balance our manufacturing resources with externally-sourced machinery, components and/or replacement parts to enable us to better control costs, inventory levels and our supply of components. We believe that our manufacturing facilities are sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Refer to Item 2, “Properties,” for a listing of our principal manufacturing locations. 
    Our AGCO Power engines division produces diesel engines, gears and generating sets. The diesel engines are manufactured for use in a portion of our tractors, combines and sprayers, and also are sold to third parties. AGCO Power specializes in the manufacturing of off-road engines in the 75 to 600 horsepower range.
Components and Third-Party Suppliers
    We externally source some of our machinery, components and replacement parts from third-party suppliers. Our production strategy is intended to optimize our research and development and capital investment requirements and to allow us greater flexibility to respond to changes in market conditions.
    We purchase some fully-manufactured tractors from Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited (“TAFE”), Carraro S.p.A. and Iseki & Company, Limited. We also purchase other tractors, implements and hay and forage equipment from various third-party suppliers. Refer to Note 13 of our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for further discussion of our relationship with TAFE.
    In addition to the purchase of machinery, third-party suppliers supply us with significant components used in our manufacturing operations. We select third-party suppliers that we believe are low cost and high quality and possess the most appropriate technology.
    We also assist in the development of these products or component parts based upon our own design requirements. Our past experience with outside suppliers generally has been favorable.
Intellectual Property
    We own and have licenses to the rights under a number of domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, trade names and brand names relating to our products and businesses. We defend our patent, trademark and trade and brand name rights primarily by monitoring competitors’ machines and industry publications and conducting other investigative work. We consider our intellectual property rights, including our right to use our trade and brand names, important in the operation of our businesses. However, we do not believe we are dependent on any single patent or group of patents, although several of our trade and brand names are internationally recognized and are vital to our operations. We intend to maintain the separate strengths and identities of our core brand names and product lines.
Engineering and Research
    We make significant expenditures for engineering and applied research to improve the quality and performance of our products, to develop new products and to comply with government safety and engine emissions regulations.
Wholesale Financing
    Primarily in the United States and Canada, we engage in the standard industry practice of providing dealers with floor plan payment terms for their inventories of farm equipment for extended periods, generally through our AGCO Finance joint ventures. The terms of our wholesale finance agreements with our dealers vary by region and product line, with fixed payment schedules on all sales, generally ranging from one to 12 months. In the United States and Canada, dealers typically are not required to make an initial down payment, and our terms allow for an interest-free period generally ranging from one to 12 months, depending on the product. Amounts due from sales to dealers in the United States and Canada are immediately due upon a retail sale of the underlying equipment by the dealer, with the exception of sales of grain storage and protein production systems, as discussed further below. If not previously paid by the dealer, installment payments generally are required beginning after the interest-free period with the remaining outstanding equipment balance generally due within 12 months after shipment. In limited circumstances, we provide sales terms, and in some cases, interest-free periods that are longer than 12 months for certain products. These typically are specified programs, predominantly in the United States and Canada, where interest is charged after a period of up to 24 months, depending on various factors including dealers' sales volumes during the preceding year. We also provide financing to dealers on used equipment accepted in trade. We generally obtain a security interest in the new and used equipment we finance.
    Typically, sales terms outside the United States and Canada are of a shorter duration, generally ranging from 30 to 180 days. In many cases, we retain a security interest in the equipment sold on extended terms. In certain international markets, our sales often are backed by letters of credit or credit insurance.
    Sales of grain storage and protein production systems both in the United States and in other countries generally are payable within 30 days of shipment. In certain countries, sales of such systems for which we are responsible for construction or installation may be contingent upon customer acceptance. Payment terms vary by market and product, with fixed payment schedules on all sales. When sales of installation services occur, fixed payment schedules may include upfront deposits, progress payments and final payment upon customer acceptance.
    We have accounts receivable sales agreements that permit transferring, on an ongoing basis, a majority of our wholesale receivables in North America, Europe and Brazil to our AGCO Finance joint ventures in the United States, Canada, Europe and Brazil. Upon transfer, the wholesale receivables maintain standard payment terms, including required regular principal payments on amounts outstanding and interest charges at market rates. Qualified dealers may obtain additional 
financing through our U.S., Canadian, European and Brazilian finance joint ventures at the joint ventures’ discretion. In addition, our AGCO Finance joint ventures may provide wholesale financing directly to dealers in Europe, Brazil and Australia.
Retail Financing
    Our AGCO Finance joint ventures offer financing to most of the end users of our products. Besides contributing to our overall profitability, the AGCO Finance joint ventures enhance our sales efforts by tailoring retail finance programs to prevailing market conditions. Our finance joint ventures are located in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, Argentina and Australia and are owned by AGCO and by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank. Refer to “Finance Joint Ventures” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for further information.
    In addition, Rabobank is the primary lender with respect to our credit facility and our senior term loan, as are more fully described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our historical relationship with Rabobank has been strong, and we anticipate its continued long-term support of our business.
Seasonality
    Generally, retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and largely are a function of the timing of the planting and harvesting seasons. To the extent possible, we attempt to ship products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal retail demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory. Our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in working capital levels, which typically increase in the first half of the year and then decrease in the second half of the year. The fourth quarter is also typically a period for higher retail sales because of our customers’ year-end tax planning considerations, the increase in the availability of funds from completed harvests and the timing of dealer incentives.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
    We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges of processed or other types of wastewater, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly changing, and the effects that they may have on us in the future are impossible to accurately predict. We attempt to comply with all applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We believe that any expense or liability we may incur in connection with noncompliance with laws or regulations or the cleanup of any of our properties will not have a materially adverse effect on us.
    The engines manufactured by our AGCO Power engine division, which specializes in the manufacturing of non-road engines in the 75 to 600 horsepower range, currently comply with emissions standards and related requirements set by European, Brazilian and U.S. regulatory authorities, including both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and various state authorities. We expect to meet future emissions requirements through the introduction of new technology to our engines and exhaust after-treatment systems, as necessary. In some markets, such as the United States, we must obtain governmental environmental approvals in order to import our products, and these approvals can be difficult or time-consuming to obtain or may not be obtainable at all. For example, our AGCO Power engine division and our engine suppliers are subject to air quality standards, and production at our facilities could be impaired if AGCO Power and these suppliers are unable to timely respond to any changes in environmental laws and regulations affecting engine emissions, including the emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). Compliance with environmental and safety regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of our products and increase the capital-intensive nature of our business.
    Climate change, as a result of emissions of GHG, is a significant topic of discussion and may generate U.S. and other regulatory responses. It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant. The most direct impacts are likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would increase our operating costs (through increased utility and transportation costs) and an increase in the costs of the products we purchase from others. In addition, increased energy costs for our customers could impact demand for our equipment. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of additional regulation, either directionally or quantitatively, on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition.
    For additional information regarding our product development plans, see the “Sustainability” section below.
Regulation and Government Policy
    Domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural industry and both directly and indirectly affect the agricultural equipment business in the United States and abroad. The application, modification or adoption of laws, regulations or policies could have an adverse effect on our business.
    We have manufacturing facilities or other physical presence in approximately 33 countries and sell our products in approximately 140 countries. This subjects us to a range of trade, product, foreign exchange, employment, tax and other laws and regulations, in addition to the environmental regulations discussed previously, in a significant number of jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions and a variety of laws regulate the contractual relationships with our dealers. These laws impose substantive standards on the relationships between us and our dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts and equipment repurchase requirements. Such laws could adversely affect our ability to terminate our dealers.
    In addition, each of the jurisdictions within which we operate or sell products has an important interest in the success of its agricultural industry and the consistency of the availability of reasonably priced food sources. These interests result in active political involvement in the agricultural industry, which, in turn, can impact our business in a variety of ways.
Sustainability
    Corporate sustainability is a core business imperative that underlies our strategy to build a more valuable enterprise through long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability in support of our key stakeholders and communities. This aligns with our purpose to provide farmer-focused solutions to sustainably feed our world. We see opportunities in every aspect of our agricultural value chain to address many of today’s most significant challenges, including food security, farmer livelihood and resource efficiency. We currently are prioritizing the following four sustainability imperatives.
Advancing Soil Health and Soil-Carbon Sequestration
    Improving soil health using practices such as cover crops, no-till farming and managing soil compaction all contribute positively to mitigate climate change. Sequestering carbon into agricultural soils and boosting crop yields is a natural positive outcome for both the farmer and the environment. We are committed to developing solutions to map, measure and implement good soil health practices. We are also applying our engineering expertise to develop innovative solutions to position agriculture and our farmers to as part of the solution to climate change.
    Over the past several years, we have invested in a thriving network of demonstration farms and initiatives to dive into topics that matter most to farmers, and to test and demonstrate the latest technologies that demonstrate core agronomy principles. We plan to expand these initiatives towards more sustainability trials including crop covering, herbicide reduction by mechanical weed control and variable rate nitrogen fertilization. We also have new products that feature precision agriculture solutions from Fuse® and Precision Planting that support soil health and the reduction of the use of chemical inputs. Our Fuse® solutions help to deliver connectivity across our entire fleet to enable and accelerate precision agriculture; specifically, by optimizing nutrient and pest control use efficiency, as well as managing compaction and machine optimization to favorably impact yield and the environment.
Decarbonizing Our Operations and Products
    We are committed to reducing CO2 emissions across our manufacturing sites worldwide to limit our impact to climate change. Smart manufacturing uses advanced technology to increase productivity while reducing energy waste and cost. Our initial priorities will focus on using cleaner sources of energy and reducing consumption by improving operational efficiencies. The goal of our research and development efforts with respect to engines is to be a pioneer for the farmers of today and tomorrow by designing lower emission and more fuel-efficient engines.
    We continue to invest substantial resources in research and development activities to create and deploy advanced technologies as well as to significantly enhance existing traditional technologies with continual improvements in vehicle engine and transmission efficiencies. Our research efforts also include alternative fuel solutions as well as the acceleration of electrification, natural gas, hybrid technology and fuel cell alternatives. We are committed in the near term to improve the efficiency of vehicles that rely on internal combustion engines. Our engines are Tier 4 compliant in the United States, and Stage V compliant in Europe. We were one of the first in our industry to adopt Selective Catalytic Reduction (“SCR”) technology. SCR systems are highly efficient at treating the engine-out exhaust, significantly reducing NOX emissions, as well as carbon release.

    We are piloting a fully electric Fendt® tractor that has current potential in livestock, greenhouse farming and specialty crops as well as municipality applications. We look to further advance this technology to develop battery powered equipment in other agricultural applications to enable our customers to reduce the CO2 footprint in their production processes. Lastly, We plan to grow our remanufacturing business with respect to engines and other components in order to avoid energy use and emissions, to eliminate waste and to conserve raw materials.
    We intend to complete a climate risk assessment in 2021 that will encompass our global operations and markets that we believe will inform a set of climate actionable goals to ensure our business is both financially resilient and optimal for growth during the transition to a low carbon economy. We also are in the process of reviewing various components of our business in order to identify measurable sustainability metrics for which we can establish future improvement goals.
Elevating Employee Health, Safety and Well-Being
    Safety is a priority at AGCO, and we want to ensure that all of our workplaces protect the health and safety of our employees, as well as prevent long-term occupational health risks. We conduct occupational risk assessments regularly, leveraging our long-term shop floor experience, and are committed to achieving zero work-related fatalities across our global operations. We are embedding a new enterprise-wide model to advance our culture of health and safety, built upon the success of our current health and safety program that was launched in 2014. Our goal is to raise productivity and lower accident incident rates in the countries in which we operate.
Prioritizing Animal Welfare in Food Production
    We are committed to a culture that supports animal welfare, and we intend to leverage technology in order to drive innovation for animal-based food production that ensures the care, nutrition, health and welfare of farm animals. We also intend on being a leader in promoting awareness of the advances in modern animal agriculture, demonstrating how innovations are helping farmers to care for their animals, while also helping to reduce the environmental impact of animal agricultural operations. Digital innovation is at the forefront of modern animal agriculture, and our platform for protein operations helps farmers monitor their livestock including feed, watering, animal weight, ventilation, cooling, heating and lighting data. Digitalization of the farm not only provides valuable insight to inform product and service evolution to the farmer, but it also provides food transparencies that consumers care about.
    We are enhancing our strategy to design, engineer and manufacture industry-leading protein solutions, building upon and further developing our advanced aviary systems, precision-feeding systems and organic sheds.
    For additional information on our sustainability efforts and reporting, refer to the “Corporate Social Responsibility” section on our website located under “Investors.”
Human Capital
    We have approximately 21,400 employees worldwide, who are guided by our Company’s clear purpose – Farmer-focused solutions to sustainably feed our world. Employees are further guided by our global Code of Conduct, which builds on the foundation of our embedded core values: Integrity, Trust, Respect, Team Spirit and Accountability. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing talent development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee well-being, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work.
    While fluctuations may occur within our workforce from time to time, we manage and track our attrition rates, while also ensuring that key positions critical to our performance our appropriately staffed. We also analyze employee departure data so that we can continually improve upon the employee experience. During 2020, our employee turnover rate related to voluntary terminations was approximately 5.3%.
Unions, Collective Bargaining Agreements and Work Councils
    Of our 21,400 employees worldwide, approximately 4,730 are located in the United States and Canada. A majority of our employees at our manufacturing facilities, in the aggregate, are represented by collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates. We currently do not expect any significant difficulties in renewing these agreements.
    Some examples of key programs and initiatives that we are focused on to enable us to attract, retain and develop our diverse workforce are described below:
Talent
    To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make AGCO an inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by platforms that build connections between our employees and their communities.    
    Over the past year, our employees have completed online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories – leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical competencies and compliance. We are deeply committed to identifying and developing the next generation of top-tier leadership with a special focus on diverse and technologically innovative talent. We conduct annual in-depth talent and succession reviews with our senior leadership team that focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles.
Rewards
    We are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance-based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent. In addition to salaries, our compensation programs include annual incentive bonuses, stock awards, and participation in various retirement savings plans, dependent upon the position and level of employee, and the countries in which we operate. We also invest in talent development initiatives to support the ongoing career development of all employees, including learning management and leadership programs targeted towards female and minority populations.
Health, Wellness and Safety
    We are also committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. For instance, in the United States, we provide our employees and their families with flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including competitive benefits arrangements. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, of which comply with government regulations. This includes having our employees work from home when possible and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Diversity
    Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board. Three of our 13 board members are women. Women represent approximately 12% of our full-time executive positions at the senior vice president and vice president levels, and approximately 16% of our overall full-time management-level employees.
    Building upon our core values, our employees value learning from different perspectives and welcome the opportunity to work with those of diverse backgrounds. Through our global TRAIT (our diversity and inclusion initiative), employees take part in robust training, such as creating an inclusive environment and cultural training. We also provide our employees with resource groups such as AGCO’s Global Women’s Network, and AGCO’s Black Employee Network, to support a broader understanding of experiences as well as to drive awareness aimed to combat unconscious bias. Through our TRAIT initiatives, we encourage employees to become involved in their communities, contributing time and talent for the improvement of the communities in which they live and work.
