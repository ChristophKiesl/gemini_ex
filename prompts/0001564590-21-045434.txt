Item 1. Business 
 Performance Food Group Company (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PFG”), through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes more than 250,000 food and food-related products from 107 distribution centers to over 250,000 customer locations across the United States. Our more than 23,000 employees serve a diverse mix of customers, from independent and chain restaurants to schools, business and industry locations, hospitals, vending distributors, office coffee service distributors, retailers, convenience stores, and theaters. We source our products from various suppliers and serve as an important partner to our suppliers by providing them access to our broad customer base. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy. 
 On May 17, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the Company will acquire Core-Mark in a stock and cash transaction. Under the terms of the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company, Core-Mark shareholders will receive $23.875 per share in cash and 0.44 shares of PFG common stock for each share of Core-Mark common stock. The transaction values Core-Mark at approximately $2.5 billion, including CoreMark’s net debt. The cash portion of the purchase price is expected to be financed with borrowing under the ABL Facility (as defined below under “- Financing Activities”).
 We believe that our short-term performance has been, and is expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the country, federal, state, and local governments implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, shutdowns, and social distancing requirements. These measures adversely affected workforces, suppliers, customers, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets.
 As an essential element of the country’s food supply chain, the Company has continued to operate all of it distribution centers. Despite the Company’s continued operations, mandatory and voluntary containment measures in response to COVID-19 had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the food-away-from-home industry. Many restaurants have closed, are restricting the number of patrons they will serve at one time, or are only providing carry-out or delivery options. These restrictions have also impacted businesses throughout the economy, including theaters, retail operations, schools, and other businesses to whom we provide products and services, which collectively have adversely affected our results of operations, including significant decreases in sales. Despite these difficulties, we have taken steps to ensure a strong financial position, including steps to maintain financial liquidity, forging new customer relationships, supporting restaurant customers with the transition to higher volumes of take-out and delivery, and other means.
 Even as governmental restrictions are eased and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain states and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic, as well as the potential for restrictions being re-implemented as COVID-19 cases rise, may continue to affect consumer behavior and spending in the channels we serve. The extent to which these changes will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain.
 Our Segments 
 Foodservice. Foodservice offers a “broad line” of products, including custom-cut meat and seafood, as well as products that are specific to our customers’ menu requirements. Foodservice operates a network of 72 distribution centers, each of which is run by a business team who understands the local markets and the needs of its particular customers and who is empowered to make decisions on how best to serve them. This segment serves over 150,000 customer locations with over 185,000 food and food-related products. 
 The Foodservice segment markets and distributes food and food-related products to independent restaurants, chain restaurants, and other institutional “food-away-from-home” locations. Independent customers, predominantly include family dining, bar and grill, pizza and Italian, and fast casual restaurants. We seek to increase the mix of our total sales to independent customers because they typically use more value-added services, particularly in the areas of product selection and procurement, market trends, menu development, and operational strategy and also use more of our proprietary-branded products (“Performance Brands”), which are our highest margin products. As a result, independent customers generate higher gross profit per case that more than offsets the generally higher supply chain costs that we incur in serving these customers. Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include fine dining, family and casual dining, fast casual, and quick serve restaurants, as well as hotels, healthcare facilities, and other multi-unit institutional customers. Our Foodservice segment’s chain customers include regional businesses requiring short-haul routes as well as national businesses requiring long-haul routes, including many of the most recognizable family 
 4


and casual dining restaurant chains. Sales to chain customers are typically lower gross margin but have larger deliveries than those to independent customers.
 We offer our customers a broad product assortment that ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, refrigerated products, and dry groceries to disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer, we provide value-added services by enabling our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy. 
 Our products consist of Performance Brands, as well as nationally branded products and products bearing our customers’ brands. Our Performance Brands typically generate higher gross profit per case than other brands. Nationally branded products are attractive to chain, independent, and other customers seeking recognized national brands in their operations and complement sales of our Performance Brand products. Some of our chain customers, particularly those with national distribution, develop exclusive stock keeping units (“SKU”) specifications directly with suppliers and brand these SKUs. We purchase these SKUs directly from suppliers and receive them into our distribution centers, where they are mixed with other SKUs and delivered to the chain customers’ locations.
 Vistar. Vistar is a leading national distributor of candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and other tobacco products to vending and office coffee service distributors, retailers, theaters, convenience stores, and hospitality providers. The segment provides national distribution of approximately 65,000 different SKUs of candy, snacks, beverages, and other items to over 100,000 customer locations from our network of 35 Vistar OpCos and 4 Merchant’s Marts locations. 
 Vending operators comprise Vistar’s largest channel, where we distribute a broad selection of vending machine products to the operators’ depots, from which they distribute products and stock machines. Additionally, Vistar is a leading distributor of products to theater chains as well as in the office coffee service channel.  Vistar has successfully built upon our national platform to broaden the channels we serve to include convenience stores, hospitality venues, concessionaires, airport gift shops, college book stores, corrections facilities, and impulse locations in various brick and mortar big box retailers nationwide. Merchant’s Marts are cash-and-carry operators where customers generally pick up orders rather than having them delivered. Vistar’s scale in these channels enhances our ability to procure a broad variety of products for our customers. Vistar OpCos deliver to vending and office coffee service distributors and directly to most theaters and some other locations. The distribution model also includes a “pick and pack” capability, which utilizes third-party carriers and Vistar’s SKU variety to sell to customers whose order sizes are too small to be served effectively by our delivery network. We believe these capabilities, in conjunction with the breadth of our inventory, are differentiating and allow us to serve many distinct customer types. 
 The Company had no customers that comprised more than 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, one of the Company’s customers within the Vistar segment accounted for 10.2% of our total net sales. 
 Suppliers
 We source our products from various suppliers and serve as an important partner to our suppliers by providing them access to our broad customer base. Many of our suppliers provide products to both reportable segments, while others sell to only one segment. Our supplier base consists principally of large corporations that sell their national brands, our Performance Brands, and sometimes both. We also buy from smaller suppliers, particularly on a regional basis, and particularly those that specialize in produce and other perishable commodities. Many of our suppliers provide sales material and sales call support for the products that we purchase. 
Pricing 
 Our pricing to customers is either set by contract with the customer or is priced at the time of order. If the price is by contract, then it is either based on a percentage markup over cost or a fixed markup per unit, and the unit may be expressed either in cases or pounds of product. If the pricing is set at time of order, the pricing is agreed to between our sales associate and the customer and is typically based on a product cost that fluctuates weekly or more frequently. 
 If contracts are based on a fixed markup per unit or pound, then our customers bear the risk of cost fluctuations during the contract life. In the case of a fixed markup percentage, we typically bear the risk of cost deflation or the benefit of cost inflation. If pricing is set at the time of order, we have the current cost of goods in our inventory and typically pass cost increases or decreases to our customers. We generally do not lock in or otherwise hedge commodity costs or other costs of goods sold except within certain customer contracts where the customer bears the risk of cost fluctuation. We believe that our pricing mechanisms provide us with significant insulation from fluctuations in the cost of goods that we sell. Our inventory turns, on average, every three-and-a-half weeks, which further protects us from cost fluctuations.

We seek to minimize the effect of higher diesel fuel costs both by reducing fuel usage and by taking action to offset higher fuel prices. We reduce usage by designing more efficient truck routes and by increasing miles per gallon through on-board computers that monitor and adjust idling time and maximum speeds and through other technologies. In our Foodservice and Vistar segments, we seek to manage fuel prices through diesel fuel surcharges to our customers and through the use of costless collars. As of July 3, 2021, we had collars in place for approximately 37% of the gallons we expect to use over the 12 months following July 3, 2021. 
 Competition
 The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Furthermore, there are two large broadline distributors, Sysco, and US Foods, with national footprints. In addition, there are numerous regional, local, and specialty distributors. These smaller distributors often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and to assemble delivery networks for national or multi-regional distribution. We often do not have exclusive service agreements with our customers and our customers may switch to other distributors if those distributors can offer lower prices, differentiated products, or customer service that is perceived to be superior. We believe that most purchasing decisions in the foodservice business are based on the quality and price of the product and a distributor’s ability to fill orders completely and accurately and to provide timely deliveries. 
 We believe we have a competitive advantage over regional and local broadline distributors through economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, which allow us to offer a broad variety of products (including our proprietary Performance Brands) at competitive prices to our customers. Our customers benefit from our ability to provide them with extensive geographic coverage as they continue to grow. We believe we also benefit from supply chain efficiency, including a growing inbound logistics backhaul network that uses our collective distribution network to deliver inbound products across business segments; best practices in warehousing, transportation, and risk management; the ability to benefit from the scale of our purchases of items not for resale, such as trucks, construction materials, insurance, banking relationships, healthcare, and material handling equipment; and the ability to optimize our networks so that customers are served from the most efficient distribution centers, which minimizes the cost of delivery. We believe these efficiencies and economies of scale will provide opportunities for improvements in our operating margins when combined with an incremental fixed-cost advantage. 
 Seasonality 
 Historically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our first and third fiscal quarters, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a temporary disruption to historic seasonal trends.
Trademarks and Trade Names 
 We have numerous perpetual trademarks and trade names that are of significant importance, including West Creek, Silver Source, Braveheart 100% Black Angus, Empire’s Treasure, Brilliance, Heritage Ovens, Village Garden, Guest House, Piancone, Luigi’s, Ultimo, Corazo, Assoluti, Peak Fresh Produce, Roma, First Mark, and Nature’s Best Dairy. Although in the aggregate these trademark and trade names are material to our results of operations, we believe the loss of a trademark or trade name individually would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company does not have any material patents or licenses. 
Human Capital Resources
 One of our primary strategies is to attract, train, develop, and retain talented individuals that feel empowered to fully contribute their diverse backgrounds, experiences, and innovative ideas to the success of the Company. We also recognize the importance of keeping our associates safe and healthy, as well as giving them a voice and listening to their concerns and suggestions.  Below, we discuss our efforts to achieve these objectives.
 Associates. As of July 3, 2021, our employee population (including employees of our consolidated subsidiaries) totaled approximately 23,000 full-time and part-time employees in the U.S. Of that total, approximately 99% were employed on a full-time basis, and approximately 66% were non-exempt, or paid on an hourly basis. 
 Compensation and Benefits. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our associates work. We offer incentive programs that provide cash bonus opportunities to encourage and reward participants for the Company’s achievement of financial and other key performance metrics and strengthen the 
 6


connection between pay and performance. We also grant equity compensation awards that vest over time through our long-term incentive plan to eligible associates to align such associates’ incentives with the Company’s long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders
 PFG also offers competitive benefits to its associates, including paid vacation and holidays, family leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, dependent care flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) plan with a company match, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Additionally, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that includes professional support for associates to balance the stress of personal and professional demands at home, in the office, in distribution centers and on the road.
 Workforce Diversity. As a company we are committed to building an inclusive and equitable culture that embraces and celebrates our associates’ diverse backgrounds and unique lived experiences.  In fiscal 2021, we reinforced this commitment by hiring our first Vice President of Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”). She will build on this commitment to create a more diverse and inclusive work environment by implementing a thoughtful D&I framework that will include, among other things, a focus on clear leadership roles and accountability, new talent acquisition practices, employee communities, and inclusive performance management.  Our Chief Human Resources Officer currently provides quarterly updates to the Board and will continue to do so. With five out of 11 Board leaders representing gender and ethnic diversity, our commitment to ensure workforce diversity is reflected at every level of the organization and connects to our social responsibility and business imperatives.
 Training and Development. We have a longstanding and robust training program that provides role-specific training and also offers management training to advance leadership skills used in our succession planning process. Our annual process identifies key contributors, high impact performers, and those we feel represent our top talent at various levels of leadership in the business. This process is used to select participants in our leadership program. We have also been an active participant with the Women’s Foodservice Forum (WFF) in leveraging their annual leadership conference and other events centered around developing women leaders in our industry. Additionally, our Foodservice segment has developed what we believe is an industry-leading sales training program that prepares our new sales associates for success while ensuring a more consistent, reliable, and positive customer experience. Finally, through our online learning platform we deliver a variety of required and optional on-demand learning modules that are linked to an associate’s role with the Company, including those modules tied to our Code of Business Conduct and anticorruption, which are completed annually by all associates.
 Health, Safety and Wellness. From a workplace safety standpoint, we focus on training, awareness, behavioral based work observation practices, and culture in our continuous effort to reduce workplace injuries and accidents. Our focus had a positive impact as we reduced our recordable injury rate in the workplace during fiscal 2021 by 3% as compared to the prior fiscal year, and we reduced road accidents per million miles driven by 20% during fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. We are always focused on the safety of our associates and have a strong emphasis on identifying and addressing the safety risks to and concerns of our associates. We acted quickly to develop and implement enhanced safety protocols to address the COVID-19 pandemic and protect the health and safety of our associates.
 Engagement. PFG works to build, measure, and sustain associate engagement through a variety of communications and activities. We participate in and celebrate industry efforts, such as the International Foodservice Distributors Association’s Truck Driving Championship and Truck Driver Hall of Fame, highlight locally and share internally and externally significant achievements for our warehouse associates, and honor the diversity of our associates, along with our customers and communities, by celebrating, among other things, heritage months. To measure associate engagement levels, PFG conducted its first enterprise-wide engagement survey in October 2020, with an overall response rate of 76%. We have parallel activities in progress to study and use the results of the survey for enterprise and more localized improvement efforts and are leveraging responses to help shape our diversity and inclusion strategy.Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation affecting the foodservice industry. These government authorities regulate, among other things, the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of our products. In 2010, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”) was enacted. The FSMA requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. As a result, implementation of the legislation is ongoing and likely to take several years. Our seafood operations are also specifically regulated by federal and state laws, including those administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service, established for the preservation of certain species of marine life, including fish and shellfish. Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. State and/or federal authorities generally inspect our facilities at least annually. The Federal 
 7


Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection, and rejection of agricultural products, governs our relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product shipments. We are also subject to regulation by state authorities for the accuracy of our weighing and measuring devices. Our suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. 
 The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters, cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, closure of facilities or operations, the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals, or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. 
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements, including, employment practice standards for workers set by the U.S. Department of Labor, and relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These include requirements regarding the use, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and petroleum products, including food processing wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and worker safety and health practices and procedures. In order to comply with environmental, health, and safety requirements, we may be required to spend money to monitor, maintain, upgrade, or replace our equipment; plan for certain contingencies; acquire or maintain environmental permits; file periodic reports with regulatory authorities; or investigate and clean up contamination. We operate and maintain vehicle fleets, and some of our distribution centers have regulated underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products. Some jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that affect the composition and operation of our truck fleet, such as limits on diesel emissions and engine idling. A number of our facilities have ammonia- or freon-based refrigeration systems, which could cause injury or environmental damage if accidentally released, and many of our distribution centers have propane or battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs. To date, our cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety requirements has not been material. The discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, any accidental release of regulated materials, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced could require us to incur additional costs or subject us to unexpected liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed in the U.S. Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our motor carrier operations. Failure to comply with the applicable motor carrier regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits.
