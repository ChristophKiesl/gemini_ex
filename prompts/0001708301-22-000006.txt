Item 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
Overview
BP Midstream Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed on May 22, 2017 by BP Pipelines, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP, a “foreign private issuer” within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On October 30, 2017, the Partnership completed its initial public offering (the "IPO") of common units representing limited partner interests.
We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by BP Pipelines, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BP, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Partnership assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines and refined product terminals serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP’s Whiting Refinery and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain Partnership assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers.
Merger Transactions
Take Private Proposal
On August 4, 2021, the board of directors of BP Midstream Partners GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of our Partnership (the “General Partner”) received a non-binding preliminary proposal letter from BP Pipelines, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BP Midstream Partners Holdings LLC, to acquire all of our issued and outstanding common units not already owned by BP Pipelines or its affiliates at a to-be-determined fixed exchange ratio.
Merger Agreement
On December 19, 2021, BP Midstream Partners LP, BP Midstream Partners GP LLC, BP p.l.c., BP Midstream Partners Holdings LLC, (“Holdings”), and BP Midstream RTMS LLC (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BP (the “Merger”).
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) each outstanding common unit other than those owned by BP and its subsidiaries (each, a “Public Common Unit”) will be converted into the right to receive 0.575 BP American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) each representing six ordinary shares of BP (the “Merger Consideration” and such ratio, the “Exchange Ratio”). In connection with the Merger, (i) any partnership interests that are owned by the Partnership or any of the Partnership’s subsidiaries will be cancelled; and (ii) the common units owned by Parent and its subsidiaries, the General Partner’s general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership will not be cancelled, will not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and will remain outstanding following the Merger.
The Partnership has entered into a Support Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2021 (the “Support Agreement”), with Holdings, pursuant to which Holdings has irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to deliver a written consent covering all of the common units beneficially owned by it in favor of the Merger, the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any other matter necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Support Written Consent”), within two business days following the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Registration Statement
A registration statement on Form F-4 registering 165,164,448 shares of BP Ordinary Shares, which will be issued in the form of American depositary shares, each representing six BP Ordinary Shares (“BP ADSs”), to effectuate such acquisition of Public Common Units was filed by BP on January 31, 2022, as amended (Registration No. 333-262425) (the “Registration Statement”) and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 4, 2022. Completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. Upon completion, the Partnership Common Units will cease to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and will be subsequently deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For more information, see the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Merger in this Annual Report.

Onshore Crude Oil, Refined Products and Diluent Pipelines
 

Offshore Crude Oil and Natural Gas Pipelines

Our Commercial Agreements with BP

Minimum Volume Commitment Agreements

Our onshore assets provide vital movements to and from, and are integral to the operation of, BP’s Whiting Refinery. We have commercial agreements with BP Products for our onshore pipelines that include minimum volume commitments and support substantially all of our aggregate revenue on BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Under these fee-based agreements, we provide transportation services to BP Products, and BP Products has committed to pay us for minimum volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent, regardless of whether such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipelines during the term of the agreements.

Pipeline | Period | Annual MinimumThroughput Commitment (kbpd)* 
BP2 | 2021 | 300 
 | 2022 | 290 
 | 2023 | 280 
River Rouge | 2021 - 2023 | 60 
Diamondback | Q3 2017 - Q2 2022 | 23 
 | 2021 - 2023 | 10 

* Transportation fee rate is the posted tariff.
Under each of our throughput and deficiency, or “minimum volume commitment,” agreements, BP Products is obligated to throughput certain minimum volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent on our onshore pipelines and pay the applicable tariff rates with respect to such volumes. 
The following sets forth additional information regarding each of our minimum volume commitment agreements:

BP2 Throughput and Deficiency Agreement. Under this agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on our BP2 pipeline from Griffith, Indiana to the Whiting Refinery during any month through December 31, 2023, then BP Products will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual rate, which is calculated based on the applicable tariff rate then in effect (the “Deficiency Payment”). The amount of any deficiency payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on our BP2 pipeline in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.

River Rouge Throughput and Deficiency Agreement. Under this agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on River Rouge from Whiting, Indiana to various terminals along the pipeline during any month through December 31, 2023, then BP Products will pay us a Deficiency Payment. The amount of any deficiency payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on River Rouge in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.

Diamondback Throughput and Deficiency Agreements. Under this agreement, if BP Products fails to transport its minimum throughput volume on our Diamondback pipeline from Gary, Indiana to Manhattan, Illinois during any month through December 31, 2023, then BP Products will pay us, during such period, a deficiency payment. The amount of any Deficiency Payment paid by BP Products under this agreement may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on our Diamondback pipeline in excess of BP Products’ minimum volume commitment during the calendar year in which such credits arose, after which time any unused credits will expire.
In addition, we are a party to one throughput and deficiency agreement with BP Products and one dedication agreement with a third party for Diamondback. The dedication agreement with a third party on Diamondback automatically renewed in 2021 and will now expire in June 2022. This contract is subject to successive one-year renewal periods at the election of the parties. The throughput and deficiency agreement for Diamondback automatically renewed in 2021 and will now expire in June 2022.

Termination of Throughput and Deficiency Agreements. BP Products has the right to terminate these agreements if we fail to perform any of our material obligations and fail to correct such non-performance within specified periods, or in the event of a change of control of our general partner.

BP Products is not permitted to suspend or reduce its obligations under these agreements in connection with the shutdown of the Whiting Refinery for any reason other than certain force majeure events, including for scheduled maintenance or other regular servicing or maintenance.

Under these agreements, if a force majeure event occurs and renders us or BP Products unable to meet our respective obligations under the agreement and continues for 365 consecutive days or more, then the party not claiming non-performance due to such force majeure event shall have the right to terminate the agreement on no less than 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party. 
Right of First Offer

We have entered into an omnibus agreement with BP Pipelines under which BP Pipelines granted us a ROFO, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) seven years after the IPO or (ii) the date on which BP Pipelines or its affiliates cease to control our general partner. Pursuant to the ROFO, BP Pipelines has agreed and will cause its affiliates to agree that if BP Pipelines or any of its affiliates decide to attempt to sell (other than to another affiliate of BP Pipelines) BP Pipelines’ retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of BP Pipelines’ interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that were owned by BP Pipelines at the closing of the IPO (the “Subject Assets”), BP Pipelines or its affiliate will notify us of its desire to sell such Subject Assets and, prior to selling such Subject Assets to a third party, will allow us 45 days from such notice to make a binding written offer regarding such Subject Assets. In addition to BP Pipelines’ retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras, the assets subject to our ROFO include three crude oil and natural gas liquid pipeline systems with an aggregate gross length of approximately 1,550 miles and an aggregate gross capacity of approximately 1,800 kbpd and nine refined products pipeline systems with an aggregate gross length of approximately 1,940 miles and an aggregate gross capacity of approximately 620 kbpd, as of December 31, 2021.

The consideration to be paid by us for the Subject Assets, as well as the consummation and timing of any acquisition by us of those assets, would depend upon, among other things, the timing of BP Pipelines’ decision to sell those assets and our ability to successfully negotiate a price and other mutually agreeable purchase terms for those assets. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from BP or third parties, our future growth would be limited, and any acquisitions we may make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.
Payment of Administrative Fee and Reimbursement of Expenses
Under the omnibus agreement, we pay BP Pipelines an administrative fee annually (payable in equal monthly installments), to reimburse BP Pipelines and its affiliates for the provision of certain general and administrative services for our benefit, including services related to the following areas: executive management services; financial management and administrative services (such as treasury and accounting); information technology services; legal services; health, safety and environmental services; land and real property management services; human resources services; procurement services; corporate engineering services; business development services; investor relations, communications and external affairs; insurance administration and tax related services.

Under this agreement, we also reimburse BP Pipelines and its affiliates for all other direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by BP Pipelines in providing these services to us, including personnel costs related to the direct operation, management, maintenance and repair of the assets. This reimbursement is in addition to our reimbursement of our general partner and its affiliates for certain costs and expenses incurred on our behalf for managing and controlling our business and operations as required by our partnership agreement.

We paid our Parent an annual fee of $15.5 million, $14.0 million and $13.6 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the omnibus agreement.
Our general partner, in good faith, may adjust the administrative fee to reflect, among others, any change in the level or complexity of our operations, a change in the scope or cost of services provided to us, inflation or a change in law or other regulatory requirements, the contribution, acquisition or disposition of our assets or any material change in our operation activities.
Customers
BP is our primary customer. Total revenue from BP represented 98.0%, 97.8%, and 97.7% of our revenues in the years 
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. BP’s volumes represented approximately 95.8%, 95.2% and 95.1% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
In addition, we transport crude oil, natural gas and diluent for a mix of third-party customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and Partnership assets are connected to other crude oil, natural gas and diluent pipeline systems. In addition to serving directly connected Midwestern U.S. and Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States and Canada through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation services for a variety of reasons. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greatest market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics in our markets.
Competition 

Our pipelines face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging and shipping, trucking and other pipelines that service the same markets as our pipelines. Our terminals compete for throughput and storage opportunities in the geographic areas in which they operate.

Competition for refined products in the Midwest is affected by supply and demand. Supply is driven by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area, the availability of products to get transported to the area and the cost of transportation to that area from other geographies. As a result of our affiliate relationships and the scope and scale of our refined products pipeline system, we believe that our refined product pipeline will not face significant new competition in the near-term. 
Even though our offshore lines are supported by fee-based life-of-lease transportation agreements, our offshore pipelines compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets. The principal competition for our offshore pipelines includes other crude oil and natural gas pipeline systems as well as producers who may elect to build or utilize their own transportation assets, although the barrier to new entrants is high due to the cost and environmental permitting required. In addition, the ability of our offshore pipelines to access future reserves will be subject to our ability, or the producers’ ability, to fund the significant capital expenditures required to connect to the new production. In general, except for Mars, our offshore pipelines are not currently subject to regulatory rate-making authority, and the rates our offshore pipelines charges for services are dependent on market and economic conditions.
We also face increased indirect competition from alternative energy sources, such as wind or solar power, and these alternative energy sources could become even more competitive as various states and the federal government develop renewable energy and climate related policies, including taking actions to restrict the production of oil and gas.
FERC and Common Carrier Regulations 

Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. 

FERC regulates interstate transportation on our common carrier refined products, diluent, and crude oil pipeline systems under the ICA as modified by the Elkins Act, the EPAct and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil, refined products and diluent (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC’s regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. Failure to comply with the requirements of the ICA could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge either existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit a common carrier pipeline’s ability to charge rates until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement 
are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms. 
A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period, if any, that the rate was in effect. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively and may require a common carrier pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the date the complaint was filed. FERC also has the authority to require changes to a pipeline's terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. We may at any time also be required to respond to governmental requests for information, including compliance audits conducted by FERC. 
The EPAct required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer’s Price Index for Finished Goods (“PPI-FG”). The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. On December 17, 2020, in Docket No. RM20-14-000, FERC issued an order establishing a new index level of PPI-FG plus 0.78% for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 ("December 2020 Order"). Requests for rehearing of the December 2020 Order were filed with FERC. On January 20, 2022, FERC issued an order on rehearing that reverses its December 2020 Order on the five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index. FERC lowered the index from PPI-FG plus 0.78% to PPI-FG minus 0.21%. The rehearing order also directs oil pipelines to recompute their rate ceiling levels for July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, based upon the index of PPI-FG minus 0.21%, to be effective March 1, 2022. Additionally, FERC issued a notice that adjusts the annual change in the oil pipeline rate index for the period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, to implement the PPI-FG minus 0.21% index, explaining that oil pipelines must multiply their July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 index ceiling levels by positive 0.984288 to recompute their July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 index ceiling levels. 
We cannot predict whether or to what extent the index factor may change in the future. A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so. Rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable and require a protesting party to demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs. Despite these procedural limits on challenging the indexing of rates, the overall rates are not entitled to any specific protection against rate challenges. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling. Many existing pipelines, including BP2, River Rouge, Diamondback, and Mars, utilize the FERC oil index to change transportation rates annually every July 1.

While common carrier pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carrier pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates. A common carrier pipeline can propose a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling), but must establish that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. A common carrier can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. A common carrier can change existing rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. Initial rates for a new service on a common carrier pipeline can be established through a negotiated rate with an unaffiliated shipper, but if challenged must be supported by a cost of service. 

Intrastate services provided by certain of our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities, such as the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which currently regulates Mars. State agencies typically require intrastate petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates and proposed rate increases. State agencies may also investigate rates, services, and terms and conditions of service on their own initiative. State regulatory commissions could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. 

If our rate levels were investigated by FERC or a state commission, the inquiry could result in an investigation of our costs, including: 
•the overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead; 
•the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity; 
•the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates; 
•the appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt; 
•the rate base, including the proper starting rate base; 
•the throughput underlying the rate; and
•the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes. 
FERC or a state commission could order us to change our rates, services, or terms and conditions of service or require us to pay shippers reparations, together with interest and subject to the applicable statute of limitations, if it were determined that an established rate, service, or terms and conditions of service were unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

The FERC implements the OCSLA pertaining to transportation and pipeline issues, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide non-discriminatory transportation service. The Caesar, Ursa, Cleopatra, Proteus, and portions of Endymion and Mars pipelines are located in the Outer Continental Shelf and are subject to the non-discrimination requirements in the OCSLA.
Safety

Our assets are subject to stringent safety laws and regulations. Our transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent involves a risk that hazardous liquids or flammable gases may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. PHMSA of DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our assets. BSEE of DOI has adopted similar regulations for offshore pipelines under its jurisdiction. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and necessary maintenance or repairs. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
Pipeline safety laws and regulations are subject to change over time. Changes in existing laws and regulations could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. For example, PHMSA issued the Safety of Hazardous Liquids Pipelines final rule on October 1, 2019. This final rule addressed topics such as: inspections of onshore and offshore pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters, periodic assessment of pipelines not currently subject to integrity management, expanded use of leak detection systems, increased use of in-line inspection tools, and other requirements. The new PHMSA rule requires operators of onshore pipeline segments that can accommodate in-line inspection (“ILI”) tools that are not currently subject to integrity management requirements to complete assessments using ILI tools at least once every ten years. The new rule also requires that all hazardous liquids pipelines located in high consequence areas (“HCAs”) or areas that could affect HCAs be capable of accommodating ILI tools within 20 years unless certain limited exceptions apply. PHMSA at times issues additional rulemakings related to pipeline safety. For example, in June 2021, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin advising pipeline and pipeline facility operators of applicable requirements to update their inspection and maintenance plans for the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimization of natural gas released from pipeline facilities in accordance with the PIPES Act of 2020. PHMSA, together with state regulators, are expected to commence and complete inspection of these plans in 2022.

For the pipelines we operate (BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback), we monitor the structural integrity of our pipelines through a program of periodic internal assessments using high resolution internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a review of the data and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of each pipeline. We compare these inspection and testing results with other inspection data to ensure that the highest risk pipelines receive the highest priority for consideration of additional integrity assessments or repairs. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with all state and federal regulations, and we regularly monitor, test, and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems. 
Mars, the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures, and Ursa are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Shell. KM Phoenix's terminalling assets are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan.
Security
We are subject to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines, and some of the pipelines have been identified as Critical Infrastructure Assets. Further, the SP 89E platform associated with Proteus is subject to Maritime Transportation Safety Act requirements through the U.S. Coast Guard. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of our facilities.
BP experiences cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to their systems on a regular basis. As we use BP’s systems to support our operations as provided in the omnibus agreement, we are exposed to the same attempts to gain unauthorized access. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in BP’s or other parties’ systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and adverse press coverage could harm our business. We and BP may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, harming our business.
On May 27, 2021, the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) announced Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01 that requires us, as a critical pipeline owner, to report confirmed and potential cybersecurity incidents to the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) and to designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator. It also requires BP Pipelines and the third-party operators of our assets to review current practices as well as to identify any gaps and related remediation measures to address cyber-related risks and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. We designated a Cybersecurity Coordinator, developed a plan to comply with mandatory reporting timeframes and completed the vulnerability assessment required under this directive on June 25, 2021. On July 20, 2021, the TSA issued a second Security Directive. We have evaluated the impacts of this second directive to our pipeline business and have made significant progress in compliance.
While BP has dedicated significant resources to security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams to protect our systems, BP’s and our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic (including COVID-19), may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Environmental Matters 
General.   Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe they do not affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. These laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional facilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage, or by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. 

Air Emissions.   Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes and regulations in connection with air emissions from our operations. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. 

We cannot predict the potential impact of climate change legislation and regulations to address air emissions in the United States or of any climate-related litigation on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash 
flows. However, changes in laws, regulations, policies and obligations relating to climate change, including carbon pricing, could impact our assets, costs, revenue generation and growth opportunities. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business for additional information.

Waste Management and Related Liabilities.   To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater, and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. 

CERCLA.   CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the former and present owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the transporters and generators of the hazardous substances found at the site. 
Under CERCLA, these classes of persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls within CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance” and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites and any natural resource damages. We also may have similar liabilities under state laws comparable to CERCLA. 

RCRA.   We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject to the requirements of the federal RCRA statute and its implementing regulations, and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA and states consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Significant changes in the regulations could increase our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
Hydrocarbon Wastes.   We currently own and lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or for many years have been handled. Over time, hydrocarbons or waste may have been disposed of or released on or under our properties or on or under other locations where hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties and locations have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and hydrocarbons and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to regulation under CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to take actions to prevent further contamination. 

Indemnity Under the Omnibus Agreement.   Under our omnibus agreement, our Parent will indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, litigation and other matters attributable to the ownership or operation of our assets prior to our ownership. Indemnification for certain identified environmental liabilities is subject to a cap of $25 million without any deductible. Other matters covered by the omnibus agreement are subject to a cap of $15.0 million and an aggregate deductible of $0.5 million before we are entitled to indemnification. Indemnification for any unknown environmental liabilities was limited to liabilities due to occurrences on or before October 30, 2017, which were identified prior to October 30, 2020. We continue to maintain indemnification by our General Partner for matters previously discovered. To the extent that unknown environmental liabilities arise relating to prior ownership, the Partnership will be liable.
Water.   Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent. Regulations under the Clean Water Act, OPA-90 and state laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or a delegated state agency. We obtain discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act or state laws as needed for maintenance or hydrostatic testing activities. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. 

The transportation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the liability provisions of and certain regulations issued pursuant to OPA-90 and related state requirements. 
Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. PHMSA and BSEE have promulgated regulations requiring such plans that apply to our onshore and offshore pipelines. With respect to statutory liability, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate facilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. OPA-90 applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA-90 has the potential to adversely affect our operations. 

Construction or maintenance of our pipelines may impact “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) under the Clean Water Act. A 2015 rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over such waters was repealed in December 2019, re-establishing the pre-2015 rule until it was replaced in June 2020 when the EPA’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule ("NWPR"), finalized in January 2020, became effective. The NWPR narrowed the definition of WOTUS relative to the prior 2015 rulemaking. On August 30, 2021, a federal district court vacated the NWPR. On December 7, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule revising the definition of WOTUS and proposing to return to the more expansive pre-2015 definition. Additionally, in January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the scope and authority of the Clean Water Act and the definition of WOTUS. If the scope of federal jurisdiction over such waters is revised in the future and expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which in turn could reduce demand for our services. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands or river crossings (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our pipeline projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. 
Employee Safety.   We are subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 

Endangered Species Act.   The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species, to date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts as a result of compliance with the Endangered Species Act. If current or future-listed endangered or threatened species or critical habitat are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct development activities associated with construction, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service periodically makes determinations on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The discovery of previously unidentified endangered species or threatened species or the designation and listing of new endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

National Environmental Policy Act.   Major federal actions, such as the issuance of permits associated with construction, can require the completion of certain reviews under the NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Corps, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the abandonment of proposed projects. In July 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") finalized revisions to update the NEPA regulations. On October 7, 2021, the CEQ published a proposed rule proposing to modify certain aspects of the NEPA regulations to generally restore regulatory provisions that were in existence prior to 2020. A final rule is expected in 2022. The impact of any changes to the NEPA regulations, if adopted, on our pipeline projects is uncertain.
Seasonality

Demand for crude oil, refined products and diluent generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand during the summer and winter months and decrease demand during the spring and fall months. In respect of our midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes, as many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated through the use of our fee-based long-term agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete maintenance and construction projects, which may impact our revenues and results of operations.
Title to Real Property Interests and Permits 

While there are a limited number of fee-owned properties associated with certain of our pipeline assets, substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and in some instances these rights-of-way are revocable at the election of the grantor. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that may not have been subordinated to the rights-of-way ("ROW") grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, watercourses, county roads, municipal streets, and state highways and, in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor’s election. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right to seek the use of eminent domain power to acquire rights-of-way and lands necessary for our common carrier pipelines. 
Insurance

Our assets are either self-insured or insured with third parties for certain property damage, business interruption and third-party liabilities, and such coverage includes sudden and accidental pollution liabilities, in amounts which management believes are reasonable and appropriate, and excludes named windstorm coverage.
Human Capital Resources
Our operations are conducted through, and our assets are owned by, various subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring personnel or by obtaining services of personnel employed by BP, BP Pipelines or third parties, but we sometimes refer to these individuals, for drafting convenience only, in this Annual Report as our employees because they provide services directly to us. These operations personnel primarily provide services with respect to the assets we operate: BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Mars, the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures, and Ursa are operated by an affiliate of Shell. KM Phoenix is operated by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan. Under the omnibus agreement we are required to reimburse BP for all costs attributable to operating personnel services. A portion of the operations personnel who provide services for our onshore assets are represented by labor unions. We consider our labor relations to be satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages or other material labor disputes within the last five years.
Pipeline Control Operations

BP2, River Rouge, and Diamondback, which are operated by BP Pipelines' employees, are controlled from a central control center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A fully functional back-up operations center is also maintained and routinely operated throughout the year with the aim of ensuring safe, reliable, and compliant operations. Mars, the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures, and Ursa are operated in a similar manner by an affiliate of Shell. The KM Phoenix storage and terminalling systems are operated by an affiliate of Kinder Morgan.
