Every organization from device manufacturers, to service providers, to enterprise and government organizations, seeks to optimize networks and data centers in order to accelerate, secure, and scale the delivery of these applications.
Our solutions provide the insight needed for organizations to make real-time decisions that optimize performance, harden security and increase the scalability of networks facing constantly changing requirements. Our line of hardware, software, and other services cater to the needs of network equipment manufacturers ("NEMs"), service providers, and enterprise and government organizations. Our solutions provide an end-to-end approach for our customers to test devices and systems prior to deployment, 
11


validate the performance and security of networks and data centers after every change, and help them continuously monitor network application and security behavior to manage performance.
We provide solutions and services to each of our customer segments, including those set forth below:

• | NEMs. NEMs provide voice, video, and data and service infrastructure equipment to customer network operators, service providers and network users. Such users require high standards of functionality, performance, security, and reliability. To meet these higher standards, NEMs must ensure the quality of their products during development and manufacturing (prior to deployment). Failure to ensure the consistent functionality and performance of their products may result in the loss of customers, increased research and development costs, increased support costs, and losses resulting from the return of products. These equipment manufacturers are also, in many cases, large enterprises, and therefore have the same challenges that can be met using our assessment and monitoring solutions within their own internal network. 


• | Service Providers. Service providers seek to deliver a growing variety of high quality, advanced network services ranging from traditional telecommunications and Internet services, to social networking, cloud storage and entertainment streaming. Failure to provide a quality experience to the end user can be costly through high subscriber churn rates and reduced revenues. To ensure quality of experience and service assurance, service provider R&D and network engineering groups must verify the performance and functionality of staged networks during equipment selection and network design, prior to deployment and after any change to the production network. Our network test systems emulate millions of mobile subscribers to realistically predict end-user quality of experience delivered by providers’ infrastructure and services. Post-deployment, service providers depend on our visibility solutions to help monitor and secure their networks and ensure user experience and services performance. 


• | Enterprises and Government. Enterprise and government organizations depend on their networks and data centers to get business done, and they devote enormous resources to ensure applications and services run optimally and securely. These customers rely on our solutions to help evaluate equipment during selection, optimize and harden their network designs in labs prior to roll-out, and once rolled out, continuously monitor the production network to ensure optimal performance and security of the contents flowing through it. Our security solutions are also used by major organizations to train their staff on the new generation of “cyber warfare and mitigation techniques” to recognize and defend against massive cyber-attacks. 

No single customer represented 10 percent or more of the group’s net revenue.
We do not have long-term or volume purchase contracts that commit our customers to future product purchases, and as a result our customers may reduce or discontinue purchasing from us at any time.
Ixia Solutions Group Sales and Support
Sales. We use our global direct sales force to market and sell our products and solutions. In addition, we use distributors, value added resellers, system integrators, and other partners to complement our direct sales and marketing efforts for certain vertical and geographical markets. We depend on many of our distributors, resellers, and other partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process. Our direct sales force maintains close contact with our customers and supports our distributors, resellers, and other partners. Another key component of our go-to-market strategy for certain products is strategic relationships with technical partners, consisting of network monitoring and management companies to complement their monitoring or security solutions. We work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
Ixia Technical Support. Our global team of technical support and field engineers have a high level of networking and product expertise. We enable our customers to make the best use of our products to accomplish their goals, help answer questions and resolve issues they encounter, and minimize downtime. Customers can reach our technical support team by phone, email or website. We have regional support offices in the United States, Europe and multiple countries in Asia.
Support services our team provides for our customers often include:
•assisting new customers with product installation and licensing,
•providing configuration assistance and expert advice on best practices,
•investigating and quickly solving user issues,
•troubleshooting and quickly repairing or replacing hardware as needed, and
12



• | providing access to our self-service portal where customers can report new cases and access our extensive knowledge base articles.

We also offer premium support options for customers who require even higher levels of service. We have invested in developing our case management system, support phone system, and other tools to increase our global support capability thereby allowing us to respond quickly, route customers to the best support engineer, and effectively manage their requests to resolution.
Ixia Solutions Group Manufacturing
Our manufacturing and supply operations consist primarily of new product introduction, test and manufacturing, test engineering, supply chain management, procurement, quality assurance, order management, final assembly, configuration testing, fulfillment and logistics. We outsource the manufacture, assembly and testing of printed circuit board assemblies, certain interface cards, and certain chassis to third-party contract manufacturers and assembly companies, the most significant of which are located in Malaysia and Mexico. This manufacturing process enables us to operate without dedicating substantial space and personnel solely to manufacturing operations.
Ixia Solutions Group Competition
The market for providing network test and monitoring systems is highly competitive, and we expect this competition to continue in the future. We currently compete with network test and monitoring solution vendors such as Spirent Communications, Gigamon and NetScout. We also compete either directly or indirectly with large Ethernet switch vendors and network management, analysis, compliance and test tool vendors that offer point solutions that address a subset of the issues that we solve. Additionally, some of our significant customers have developed or may develop in-house products for their own use or for sale to others.
We believe that we compete favorably in the markets we serve. We intend to remain competitive through ongoing research and development efforts that enhance existing systems and result in the development of new products and features. We will also seek to expand our market presence through marketing and sales efforts.

Services Solutions Group Sales and Operations
Services Solutions Group shares the same industry‑leading sales, marketing and support resources as the Communications Solutions Group and Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, including the same direct sales force and complementary channel partners.
Customer demand is fulfilled through regional service centers by trained technicians and engineers, located in close proximity to customers at 70 Keysight service locations in more than 30 countries. Our global presence, with localized service proximity, is an important factor in sustaining our customers’ equipment uptime and utilization requirements.
Services Solutions Group Competition
The Services Solutions Group competes with independent test equipment service providers, government measurement laboratories and other original equipment manufacturers. Many of these competitors offer a wide range of services and can support instruments from multiple manufacturers. Service quality, cost and turn‑around time drive competitiveness within our served industries. In addition, some of our instrument customers have in‑house calibration and repair capabilities. Our primary service competitors are Trescal Limited, Fortive Corporation, and Ceprei Laboratories. Due to differing country and regulatory accreditation standards, the services provided may vary greatly from country to country.
The following discussions of Research and Development, Marketing, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental and International Operations include information common to each of our businesses.
Research and Development
Research and development ("R&D") expenditures were $498 million in fiscal 2017, $425 million in fiscal 2016 and $387 million in fiscal 2015. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative, high-quality customer solutions, products and services. We are committed to investing in R&D and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves for growth.
Our R&D efforts focus on improvements to existing products and development to support new product introductions and complete customer solutions aligned to our industry. We conduct R&D in four principal areas: enabling technologies, system design, simulation and measurement. Our R&D seeks to improve on various technical competencies in electronics, software, systems and solution delivery. R&D investments are focused on delivering technology and solutions to market in the short term, as well as building a strong foundation for future solutions over a longer time horizon.
Marketing
We have several ongoing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and solutions and to inform existing and potential customers, partners and distributors about the capabilities and benefits of our expansive product, solution and service portfolio. Our marketing efforts promote the Keysight business through participating in industry trade shows and technical conferences, sponsoring technical seminars and webinars that highlight our solutions and advertising in digital media publications and physical locations. Additionally, we write and distribute various forms of marketing collateral including brochures, white papers, application notes, solutions briefs and articles for online and print journals. Finally, we communicate to our existing and potential customers through our corporate website and various social media outlets such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and our corporate blog.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers. 
At October 31, 2017, our unfilled backlog was approximately $950 million, as compared to approximately $807 million at October 31, 2016. Consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. We believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property 
We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to 
14


create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.
Materials 
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.
Environmental
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. ("HP") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 ("the separation"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.
In connection with the separation, Agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from Agilent to us. We cannot be sure that Agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
We maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
International Operations
Our net revenue originating outside the United States, as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 67 percent in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to regions based upon the location of our sales representative.
Long-lived assets located outside of the United States as a percentage of our total long-lived assets was approximately 66 percent in fiscal year 2017 and 57 percent in fiscal year 2016, with the increase primarily driven by acquisitions. Approximately 29 percent and 30 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 9 percent and 13 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Malaysia in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
15


Most of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the United States.
Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 20, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition of Material Assets
On April 18, 2017, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 30, 2017, between Keysight and Ixia (the "Merger Agreement"), we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Ixia for $1,622 million, net of $72 million of cash acquired, pursuant to an exchange offer for $19.65 per share (the "Merger Consideration"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, any outstanding and unexercised Ixia stock options with an exercise price below the Merger Consideration and any outstanding Ixia restricted stock awards were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the merger consideration of $19.65 per share (minus the exercise price for the Ixia stock options). The vested portion of the awards associated with prior service of Ixia employees represented approximately $47 million of the total consideration. We funded the acquisition with a combination of cash and proceeds from debt and equity financings.
On August 31, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ScienLab for $60 million, net of $2 million of cash acquired. ScienLab is a Germany-based company that provides test solutions to automotive original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers in the automotive and energy markets. This acquisition complements our portfolio, allowing end-to-end solutions for hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and battery test solutions that address e-mobility market dynamics. We funded the acquisition using existing cash. As a result of the acquisition, ScienLab has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Keysight.
