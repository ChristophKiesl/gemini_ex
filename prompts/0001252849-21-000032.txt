ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General
Columbia Property Trust, Inc. ("Columbia Property Trust") (NYSE: CXP) is a Maryland corporation that operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, and owns and operates commercial real estate properties. Columbia Property Trust conducts business primarily through Columbia Property Trust Operating Partnership, L.P. ("Columbia OP"), a Delaware limited partnership in which Columbia Property Trust is the general partner and majority owner (97.2%). Columbia Property Trust acquires, develops, redevelops, owns, leases, and operates real properties directly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, or through joint ventures. Unless otherwise noted herein, references to Columbia Property Trust, "Columbia," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our" herein shall include Columbia Property Trust and all subsidiaries of Columbia Property Trust, direct and indirect.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned 15 operating properties and four properties under development or redevelopment, of which 10 were wholly owned and nine were owned through joint ventures, located primarily in New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Boston. As of December 31, 2020, the operating properties contained a total of 6.2 million rentable square feet and were approximately 95.6% leased. Columbia Property Trust also provides asset and property management services for 8.0 million square feet of office space located primarily in its core markets. On January 24, 2020, we acquired Normandy Real Estate Management ("Normandy"), a leading developer, operator, and investment manager of office and mixed-use assets in New York; Boston; and Washington, D.C. (the "Normandy Acquisition").
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease which seriously disrupted activities in large segments of the economy, including in the regional economies where we operate. As some regions of the country have reopened with various restrictions, others have re-imposed previously-lifted restrictions in response to a resurgence of virus cases. We are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, tenants, and industry as a whole. We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, tenants, and communities, and have implemented extensive new cleaning and safety protocols at our properties to safely bring our tenants and employees back to work to the extent possible. Because our portfolio is well leased with minimum near-term rollover, and our rent collections level remains high, our operating performance has not materially suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic to date.
The long-term impact of the pandemic on our tenants, demand for office space, and the global economy remains uncertain and will depend on various factors, including the scope, severity, and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness and duration of actions taken by authorities to contain the pandemic, and the availability and effectiveness of vaccines or other treatments. We have worked closely with our impacted tenants and will continue to address their concerns on a case-by-case basis, including arrangements that address cash flow interruptions while generally maintaining long-term lease obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we have deferred and abated rental billings of $3.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, including our share of deferrals and abatements made by our unconsolidated joint ventures.
Real Estate Investment Objectives
We seek to acquire, develop, or redevelop and manage a commercial real estate portfolio that provides the size, quality, and market specialization needed to deliver both income and long-term growth, as measured in total return to our stockholders. Our primary strategic objective is to generate long-term stockholder returns from a combination of steadily growing cash flows and appreciation in our net asset values, through the acquisition and ownership of high-quality office buildings located in high-barrier-to-entry markets. Our value creation and growth strategies are founded in the following:

Targeted Market Strategy 
Our portfolio consists of best-in-class office properties located primarily in Central Business Districts ("CBD") within high-barrier costal office markets ("gateway markets"). Notwithstanding the current impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global economy, and on densely populated cities particularly, we believe that gateway markets will provide the greatest opportunity for increasing net income and property values over the long-term. Therefore, our acquisition efforts will continue to focus on select primary markets with strong long-term fundamentals and liquidity, including CBD and urban in-fill locations. We maintain a goal of increasing our presence in our target markets over time to leverage our scale, efficiency, and market knowledge.
New Investment Targets 
We look to acquire, develop, or redevelop strategic and premier office assets whose workplace environment appeals to quality tenants in our target markets. We concentrate on office buildings that are competitive within the top tier of their markets or that can be repositioned as such through value-add initiatives. In addition, our investment objectives include optimizing our portfolio allocation between stabilized investments and more growth-oriented, value-add investments, with an emphasis on vibrant urban-core locations and best-in-class buildings with broad market appeal over the long-term.
Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet 
We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a strong liquidity profile and proven access to capital. Consistent with our operational strategy and financing objectives, over the long term we have generally maintained debt levels at less than 40% of the undepreciated costs of our assets. As of December 31, 2020, our debt-to-real estate- asset ratio was approximately 33.4% (based on consolidated assets and debt and our proportional share of joint venture assets), and our debt maturities were laddered over the next six years.
Capital Recycling 
To date, we have primarily sold non-strategic assets (generally defined as assets outside our target markets) to increase our concentration in our target markets. In the future, we also anticipate selling some assets from our target markets to maintain a well-balanced portfolio and to harvest capital from mature assets. Our goals are to foster long-term growth and capital appreciation in our portfolio by maintaining the following:   an appropriate balance of core investments relative to value-add investments, building profiles that will continue to attract prospects for future rent growth, and activity levels that will continue to support our connections in the real estate community. We routinely evaluate our portfolio to identify assets that are good candidates for disposition in the furtherance of these goals.
Proactive Asset Management 
We believe our team is well-equipped to deliver operating results in all facets of the management process. Our leasing efforts are founded in understanding the varied and complex needs of tenants in the marketplace today. We pursue meeting those needs through new and renewal leases, as well as lease restructures that further our long-term goals. We are committed to prudent capital investment in our assets to ensure their competitive positioning and status, and rigorously pursue efficient operations and cost containment at the property level.

Segment Information
As of December 31, 2020, our reportable segments are determined based on high-barrier-to-entry markets and other geographic markets in which we have significant investments. As of December 31, 2020, our reportable segments consist of the four key markets in which we own assets. We consider geographic location when evaluating our portfolio composition and in assessing the ongoing operations and performance of our properties. See Note 16, Segment Information, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Human Capital
As of January 1, 2021, we employed 160 individuals across our markets, both in our corporate offices and at our properties. As we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across our portfolio, we remain committed to the health and safety of our employees and communities.
In addition to our focus on employee health and safety this year, we have rebuilt our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that valuing individual differences, maintaining equality, and creating an environment of inclusion across all facets of our business are essential to our continued success. As this relates to employment, we uphold fair and consistent employment practices for all individuals, and we seek employees who offer diverse perspectives as developed through their cultural, academic, and professional backgrounds. We also work to ensure that recruitment, hiring, advancement, compensation, and training practices for all positions and all levels operate with equality and are inclusive of members of underrepresented groups. The following graphs reflect the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of our workforce:
Competition
Leasing real estate is highly competitive in the current market. As a result, we experience competition for high-quality tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. Therefore, we may experience delays in re-leasing vacant space, or we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvement allowances, or offer other inducements to enable us to timely lease vacant space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the acquisition of the same properties, which may result in an increase in the amount we must pay to purchase a property. Further, at the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
We are dependent upon the ability of our tenants to pay their contractual rent amounts as they become due. The inability of a tenant to pay future rental amounts could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our rent collection levels have remained high. No single tenant accounts for more than 7% of our portfolio (based on our 2020 annualized lease revenue), and 8% of our leases (based on our 2020 annualized lease revenue) expire over the next year. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of how our dependence on tenants for our revenue, and lease defaults or terminations, particularly by a

significant tenant, could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Government Regulations
All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners, or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. There are various local, state, and federal regulatory requirements, such as fire, health, life-safety, and similar regulations, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, with which we may be required to comply, and which may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may hinder our ability to sell, rent, or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings. 
While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with the current laws and regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Compliance with new laws or regulations such as the New York Climate Mobilization Act, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us to incur material expenditures. Future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material environmental liability. Additionally, our tenants' operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties. Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay would adversely impact our earnings, cash flows, and competitive position.
