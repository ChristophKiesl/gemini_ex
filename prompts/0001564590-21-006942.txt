Item 1. Business. 
Our Vision 
 Our vision is to build the world’s most trusted and valued cannabis and hemp company. 
 We are pioneering the future of medical, wellness, and adult-use cannabis and hemp research, cultivation, processing, and distribution, globally. We are one of the leading suppliers of adult-use cannabis in Canada, medicinal cannabis in Germany, and a leading supplier of hemp products in North America.
Our Beliefs 
 Our founders started Tilray with the belief that patients and consumers should have safe access to, and a reliable supply of, quality-tested pure, precise, and predictable cannabis products. 
 Tilray is anchored around three core beliefs: 
  
• | Medical cannabis is a mainstream medicine consumed by mainstream patients - similarly, we believe adult-use cannabis and hemp products are mainstream consumer products consumed by mainstream consumers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We are witnessing a global paradigm shift regarding regulatory and consumer sentiment about cannabis and hemp. This shift is transforming a multibillion-dollar industry from a state of prohibition to one of legalization; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As this transformation occurs, trusted global brands backed by multinational supply chains will shape the future of our industry and earn the confidence of patients, consumers, healthcare practitioners and governments around the world.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Company 
 Tilray is a global pioneer in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution. We are focused on producing high-quality cannabis and cannabis-derived products primarily for recreational adult-use in Canada, and the medical cannabis market in Canada and internationally.
 We are a leader in the Canadian adult-use market. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, High Park Holdings Ltd., we offer a broad-based portfolio of brands and adult-use products, and we continue to expand our portfolio to include new innovative cannabis products and formats. We have agreements to supply 11 Canadian provinces and territories with our adult-use products for sale through their established retail distribution systems. We have also formed a number of strategic partnerships, positioning High Park to lead the adult-use market by delivering high quality innovative cannabis products. Adult-use legalization occurred in Canada on October 17, 2018 and on October 17, 2019, the Canadian adult-use regulations were amended to permit the sale of new classes of cannabis products including edibles, beverages and vape products. 
 We currently supply high-quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 17 countries spanning five continents through our subsidiaries in Australia, Canada, Germany, Latin America and Portugal, and through agreements with established pharmaceutical distributors. We cultivate medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada and medical cannabis in Portugal. We only operate in countries where cannabis or hemp-derived cannabinoids are legal and are permitted under all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws.
 We continue to be a pioneer in the development of the global cannabis market. We were one of the first companies to be licensed by Health Canada to cultivate medical cannabis in Canada and one of the first companies to become a licensed seller of medical cannabis in Canada. We were the first company to legally export medical cannabis from North America to countries in Europe, Africa, and Latin America, Australia, and Israel, and among the first companies to be licensed to cultivate and process medical cannabis in two countries, Canada and Portugal. We were also the first cannabis company to have a North American production facility and a European production facility Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certified in accordance with European Medicines Agency standards. Such GMP certification is considered the highest quality standard for a manufacturer of medicines to meet in their production and manufacturing processes. Compliance with GMP standards is also required to access the European Union (EU) medical cannabis market.
 We have successfully recruited an international advisory board consisting of world-renowned policy leaders and business leaders, who advise on our global expansion and add to our growing network of experts in their specific fields of expertise.
 We are led by an experienced management team and complemented by experienced operators, cannabis industry experts, PhD scientists, horticulturists, and extraction specialists, all of whom apply the latest scientific knowledge and technology to deliver quality-controlled, rigorously tested cannabis products on a large scale. We have made significant investments to establish Tilray as a scientifically rigorous cannabis brand and are committed to quality and excellence in every stage of cultivation, production, packaging, and selling. We have invested significant capital to develop innovative cultivation practices, proprietary product formulations, and automated production processes. 
 We are committed to establishing a leadership team and corporate culture that promotes inclusion as we continue to grow our business and expand our footprint. Diversity is a priority for our company, and we seek out talented people from a variety of backgrounds to staff our teams in all our markets.
 We believe our success is a result of our global strategy, our multinational supply chain and distribution network, and our methodical commitment to research, innovation, quality, and operational excellence. We believe recognized and trusted brands distributed through multinational supply chains will be best positioned to become 
 3

global market leaders. Our strategy is to build our brands and be a global market leader by consistently producing high-quality, differentiated products on a large scale, and distributing them around the world. 
 Arrangement Agreement
 On December 15, 2020, we entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Aphria Inc. (“Aphria”), pursuant to which Tilray will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Arrangement”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, each outstanding common share of Aphria outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Arrangement will be transferred to Tilray in exchange for 0.8381 of a share of Tilray Class 2 common stock. The obligations of Tilray and Aphria to consummate the Arrangement are subject to customary conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) obtaining the required approval of the shareholders of Tilray and Aphria, respectively, (b) obtaining an interim order and final order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approving the Arrangement, (c) the absence of any injunction or similar restraint prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Arrangement or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, (d) obtaining all required regulatory approvals, (e) no material adverse effect having occurred, (f) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, and (g) the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement. The Arrangement is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar year 2021 following the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals, as well as court approval of the Arrangement.
 In connection with the proposed transaction, Aphria will file a management information circular, and Tilray will file a proxy statement on Schedule 14A containing important information about the proposed transaction and related matters. Additionally, Aphria and Tilray will file other relevant materials in connection with the proposed transaction with the applicable securities regulatory authorities. Investors and security holders of Aphria and Tilray are urged to carefully read the entire management information circular and proxy statement (including any amendments or supplements to such documents) before making any voting decision with respect to the proposed transaction because they contain important information about the proposed transaction and the parties to the transaction. The Aphria management information circular and the Tilray proxy statement will be mailed to the Aphria and Tilray shareholders, respectively, and available on the SEDAR and EDGAR profiles of the respective companies.
 We have prepared this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as if we were going to remain an independent company. If the Arrangement is consummated, many of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will no longer be applicable.
 Business Segments 
 We report our operating results in two segments: (i) Cannabis (licensed) and (ii) Hemp (unlicensed). The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. We report total revenue, inclusive of excise duties, in two reportable segments, by product category and product channel, as follows:

Cannabis
 We are a leader in the legally licensed cannabis market, which includes Canadian Adult-Use, Canadian Medical, International Medical, and B2B bulk sales. We maintain a number of brands in each of these categories.
 Hemp
We are a leader in the unlicensed hemp products market, which includes hemp foods and cannabidiol (“CBD”) products. Our hemp food products are available in 23 countries and our CBD products are available in certain states in the United States depending on local laws and regulations. 
Our Opportunity
 We are approaching our business from a long-term, global perspective and see opportunities to: 
 Build global brands that lead, legitimize and define the future of cannabis and hemp. Historically, cannabis has been an illegal, unbranded product. As the legal cannabis market develops, and as both cannabis and hemp products and industries become more established in more countries around the world, we see unique opportunities to create, market, and distribute a broad portfolio of differentiated brands that will appeal to a diverse customer base of patients and consumers. We believe we are positioned to develop dominant global brands and expand the addressable market for our products. We also believe the emergence of the legal cannabis and hemp industries may result in a shift of consumer behavior and discretionary spending to favor cannabis and hemp products versus other products. This shift may result in the disruption of the pharmaceutical, alcohol, tobacco, and functional food and beverages industries as patients and consumers look to supplement or replace products from these categories with cannabis and hemp products. Recognizing the potential of this disruption, several large companies in these sectors have formed partnerships or made investments to gain exposure to the legal cannabis industry including: Anheuser-Busch InBev (“AB InBev”), Apotex Inc., Altria Group, Inc., Constellation Brands, Inc., Imperial Brands PLC, and Molson Coors Beverage Company. Additionally, several alcohol companies have noted in regulatory filings that legal cannabis could have an adverse impact on their business, including AB InBev, Boston Beer Company, and Molson Coors Beverage Company. We also believe many patients rely on medical cannabis as a substitute to opioids and other narcotics. This has been validated by a number of our observational patient studies as well as peer-reviewed academic research which has demonstrated the legalization of cannabis has coincided with a decline in the use of opioid-related products in some jurisdictions. Lastly, we believe functional food and beverage products that contain or are enhanced with vitamins, caffeine, electrolytes, probiotics and other additives and ingredients, will see increased competition from products containing cannabinoids such as CBD. Specifically, as the characteristics of cannabinoids gain acceptance and appreciation, we believe many consumers will choose cannabinoid-enhanced beverages in favor of sports drinks or energy drinks.

Invest in markets where cannabis and hemp products are federally legal or are expected to be federally legal. Our goal is to increase our total addressable market size as countries around the world continue to legalize cannabis for medical and adult-use. To date, 42 countries have formally legalized medical cannabis programs for either research or patient access and two countries, Canada and Uruguay, have implemented adult-use access for cannabis. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (“Farm Bill”), passed into law in December 2018, permits the cultivation of hemp and the production of hemp-derived CBD and other cannabinoids in the United States. Combined with the growing global acceptance of hemp and hemp-derived CBD products, we believe there is a significant market opportunity in hemp and hemp-derived CBD products globally. We expect to monitor, identify and selectively invest in compelling opportunities that will strengthen our leadership position and allow us to further leverage our February 2019 purchase of FHF Holdings Ltd. (“Manitoba Harvest”), a leading manufacturer and distributor of hemp foods and supplements across the United States and Canada.
 Develop innovative products and form factors that change the way the world consumes cannabis and hemp. We believe the future of the cannabis and hemp industries will primarily focus on non-combustible products that will offer patients and consumers alternatives to smoking. Similar to our beverage partnership with AB InBev, we anticipate future opportunities to partner with established pharmaceutical, food, beverage, and consumer product companies to continue to develop new non-combustible form factors that will appeal to consumers who are not interested in smoking cannabis. By developing new non-combustible products, we believe we will expand our addressable market. 
 Expand the availability of pure, precise, and predictable medical cannabis products for patients around the world. Since 2014, we have seen a significant increase in demand from both patients and governments for pharmaceutical-grade cannabis products. As medical cannabis is increasingly recognized as a viable treatment option for patients suffering from a variety of diseases and conditions, we are well-positioned to expand the availability of these products to more patients in more countries. Importantly, because we operate two fully GMP certified facilities in Canada and Portugal and because many countries require medical products to be sourced from GMP-certified facilities, we are well-positioned to grow market share in the European and other international medical cannabis markets. 
 Foster mainstream acceptance of the therapeutic potential of medical cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines. We see an opportunity to significantly expand the global market for medical cannabis products by conducting clinical research into the safety and efficacy of medical cannabis for a diverse range of conditions. By generating clinical data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of medical cannabis and cannabinoid-based medicines for various conditions, we see an opportunity to significantly expand and dominate the global medical cannabis market.
 Our Strengths 
 We are a global pioneer with a multinational supply chain and distribution network. We were the first cannabis producer to export medical cannabis from North America and legally import cannabis into the European Union. We have licenses to cultivate cannabis in Canada and Portugal. Our medical products are currently available in 17 countries spanning five continents. To achieve our goal of becoming a global cannabis leader, we have various signed agreements with established global industry leaders, including:

• | AB InBev - In December 2018, we entered into a research partnership in Canada with AB InBev, the world’s leading brewer, to research non-alcoholic beverages containing THC and CBD. AB InBev’s participation is through Labatt Breweries of Canada and Tilray’s participation is through our wholly owned subsidiary, High Park Farms Ltd. In 2019, the two companies created Fluent Beverage Company (“Fluent”) as a joint venture to develop and commercialize non-alcohol CBD-infused beverages. To date, Fluent has successfully launched ready to drink CBD-infused sparkling beverages and tea bags in Canada.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cannfections - In October 2019, High Park announced a strategic partnership with Cannfections Group Inc., whose founder is from a leading company in the confectionery space, with 85 years of experience developing and producing a variety of celebrated confectionery brands. Through our Cannfections partnership we have successfully launched THC infused edible products, including chocolates and gummies, in the Canadian market and continue to develop new product offerings.

We have agreements in place to supply adult-use cannabis to eleven provinces and territories and have been expanding our distribution, and product offerings and formats, since adult-use was legalized in Canada. We intend to continue to increase our distribution of best-in-class brands and products in the Canadian adult-use market.
 We have scientifically rigorous processes in place to produce high quality medical cannabis products and have received permits to supply patients and researchers on five continents. Governments in 17 countries have now issued permits allowing our medical cannabis products to be available for distribution to patients. We believe governments have approved the importation of our products in part because of our reputation for being a scientifically rigorous medical cannabis company known for delivering safe, high-quality products. With the guidance of our Medical Advisory Board comprised of highly accomplished researchers and physicians specializing in autism, epilepsy, cancer and dermatology, we are committed to advancing scientific knowledge about the therapeutic potential of cannabis, and have successfully received federal authorizations to supply cannabinoid products to clinical trials in Australia, the United States and Canada. 
 We have secured the exclusive rights to produce and distribute a portfolio of certain adult-use brands and products to Canadian consumers in the adult-use market. The brand licensing agreement between a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and Docklight Brands, Inc. provides us with intellectual property that we believe may give us a competitive advantage in the adult-use market in Canada. The brand licensing agreement includes the rights to commercialize recognized brand names and proprietary product formulations for a wide range of products.
 We have a successful track record of innovation within our industry. We believe our commitment to research and innovation at this early stage of the cannabis and hemp industries’ development differentiates us and gives us a competitive advantage. We have invested significant capital to develop innovative cultivation practices, world class GMP certified facilities, and innovative product formulations.
 We have developed a rigorous production process to ensure product consistency and quality as we increase the scale of our operations globally. We pride ourselves on consistently delivering high-quality products with precise chemical compositions. We were the first cannabis company to have fully GMP-certified cultivation and production facilities in both North America and Europe. GMP certification provides regulators and health care providers with assurance that our medical products are safe, high-quality products that meet rigorous production standards.
 We have a very experienced management team. We believe our management team is one of the most accomplished in the cannabis industry. We recognize the cannabis and hemp industries are in the early stages of development and we are taking a long-term, global view as we position ourselves for global success. Our management team has significant experience across a variety of consumer product categories and is well versed in evaluating potential transactions, establishing commercial partnerships, and exploiting growth opportunities. We are analytically driven and pride ourselves on making decisions that we believe will grow our business over the long term and allow us to establish our Company as leader in the cannabis and hemp categories. We continue to identify and acquire talent from leading global companies to join our team and are confident we have the diversity and depth of experience to propel Tilray into a global leadership position.
 Our Growth Strategy 
 We aspire to build the world’s most trusted and valuable global cannabis and hemp company through the following key strategies:
 Leveraging our production capacity in North America and Europe to meet current and expected long-term demand growth. We have established a production footprint in North America and Europe that will allow us to efficiently respond to the anticipated increase in market demand for cannabis and hemp products globally. We have invested in sufficient cultivation capacity, processing, production automation, extraction, and packaging to meet current demand for our products and to achieve efficiencies as we optimize the use of these facilities.
 Partnering with established distributors and retailers. As the industry continues to evolve, we anticipate the distribution of cannabis products will increasingly mirror the distribution of other pharmaceutical products and consumer packaged goods. To increase our scale efficiently and rapidly, we are partnering with established distributors and retailers globally.
 Developing a differentiated portfolio of brands and products to appeal to diverse sets of patients and consumers. We are a global pioneer shaping the future of medical and adult-use cannabis and hemp products, by developing a portfolio of high-quality cannabinoid offerings, ranging from dried flower to oils, well-defined clinical preparations, edibles, beverages, and hemp-based food products and supplements. We will continue to invest in 
 7

innovation so we can offer the most differentiated and creative portfolio of brands and products to appeal to a wide variety of patients and consumers. 
 Expanding the addressable medical market by investing in clinical research and winning the trust of regulators, researchers and physicians in countries new to medical cannabis. We are expanding our addressable medical market by working collaboratively with regulators to implement safe access programs for patients. We provide clinical data to physicians and researchers on the safety and efficacy of medical cannabis to foster mainstream acceptance and enhance our reputation.
 Maintaining a rigorous and relentless focus on operational excellence and product quality. We have developed quality management systems that enable us to meet the requirements of regulatory agencies in the markets where we sell and export products, and to consistently deliver high-quality products. As we continue to grow, we will leverage these investments while maintaining an industry leading level of safety and quality.
 Continued innovation within our industry. We have at least 50 filed patents in the fields of cannabis processing technology, formulation, composition delivery system, and treatment methods. Our business relationships have expanded to include partnerships with consumer goods companies, distributors, and renowned research and development companies. We believe our strategic partnerships differentiate us and position us to become a dominant leader in product and process innovation and development, and product distribution. We also continue to establish partnerships with leading research institutions and our clinical trials continue to generate safety and efficacy data that can inform treatment decisions, lead to the development of new products, position us to register medicines for market authorization, and enable us to obtain insurance reimbursements where feasible.
 Our Brands and Products 
 Our brand and product strategy centers on developing a broad portfolio of differentiated cannabis and hemp brands and products designed to appeal to diverse groups of patients and consumers. Our brand and product activities have been designed to comply with all local regulations and requirements, including applicable labelling and marketing restrictions. We will continue to comply with all applicable regulations as new form factors are introduced and new regulatory requirements are introduced. 
Our Medical Brand: Tilray 
 The Tilray brand has been established as a global medical cannabis brand and is designed to appeal to prescribers and patients in the global medical market by offering a wide range of high-quality, pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis and cannabinoid-based products at GMP-certified facilities. We make our products available to patients, physicians, clinics, pharmacies, governments, hospitals, and researchers, for commercial purposes, compassionate access, and clinical research.
 We believe patients choose the Tilray brand because we meet the rigorous GMP standards and the brand is a trusted, scientific based brand known for its pure, precise and predictable medical-grade products. We have successfully grown over 50 cannabis cultivars and developed a wide variety of extract products and formulations. Our global portfolio of medical cannabis products includes the following form factors:
  
• | whole flower;
--+--------------


• | ground flower;
--+---------------


• | full-spectrum oil drops and capsules;
--+--------------------------------------


• | purified oil drops medical vape pens; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | clinical compounds.
--+--------------------

 Each form factor is divided into different categories that correspond to the particular chemical composition of each product based on the concentration of two active ingredients: THC and CBD. For example; our whole flower and full-spectrum oil drops and capsules are available in the categories: THC-Dominant, CBD-Dominant, and THC and CBD Balanced.
 Our product line focuses on active ingredients and standardized, well-defined preparation methods. We use formulations and delivery formats that are intended to allow for consistent and measured dosing, and we test all our 
 8

products for potency and purity. Each of our commercial products are developed with comprehensive analysis and thorough documentation. We follow detailed and rigorous documentation standards for our own internal purposes and to meet the requirements of GMP, researchers, regulators, importers and distributors.
 We take a scientific approach to our medical-use product development which we believe establishes credibility and respect in the medical community. We produce products that are characterized by well-defined and reproducible cannabinoid and terpene content, formulated for stable pharmacokinetic profiles, which are customizable in a variety of formulations and available in capsule or liquid forms. We continue to conduct extensive research and development activities and develop and promote new products for medical use. 
 Our Adult-Use Brands 
 High Park Holdings Ltd. (“High Park”), a wholly owned subsidiary, was established to develop, produce, sell and distribute adult-use cannabis products for recreational purposes. High Park has created and launched several brands and product lines in the Canadian adult-use market including CANACA™, Dubon™, The Batch/La Batch™, and Chowie Wowie™. We also have a license agreement in place that allows us to produce and distribute certain branded adult-use products in Canada, including Marley Natural™ and Grail™. 
 We currently produce and distribute these brands and products to Canadian consumers through High Park and continue to develop additional brands and new products, such as vapes, edibles and beverages, with more innovative products in our pipeline. 
 Our portfolio of brands and products and our marketing activities have been carefully created and structured to enable us to develop and promote our brands and product lines in an effective and compliant manner.
 Retail Strategy and Brands
 High Park offers a variety of recreational adult-use cannabis products under various brands throughout Canada, including the country’s largest markets of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. We develop our brands and products based on extensive research and focus groups across the country and in some of Canada’s largest cities including Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City. 
 Our portfolio and pricing strategies are designed to compete in all tiers and product categories of the Canadian adult use market and maintain and grow our market share.

Total Global Production and Processing Capacity
 Our total production area is 3.6 million square feet as of December 31, 2020. The maximum potential production area of all the parcels we currently own or lease would be 8.1 million square feet.
Sales and Distribution 
 Pharmaceutical distribution and pharmacy supply agreements. We continue to evaluate the most efficient methods and strategic opportunities to distribute and sell our medical cannabis products to patients and pharmacies around the world. 

• | In Germany, our products are distributed by multiple wholesalers and directly to pharmacies. As a result, we are able to fulfill prescriptions for our medical cannabis products through every pharmacy in Germany.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have formed partnerships with distributors in several other countries around the world which enable us to now make Tilray products available to patients in 17 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Israel, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Adult-use supply agreements. We have supply agreements with all of the provincial bodies responsible for cannabis distribution in their province and our products are available in 11 of 13 provinces and territories. 
 Direct-to-patient (“DTP”). In Canada, we primarily distribute our medical products directly to patients and have developed an online portal for patients to effectively and efficiently manage the process of registering and ordering our medical products. 
 11

Wholesale. In Canada, we are authorized to sell wholesale bulk and finished cannabis products to other licensees under the Cannabis Regulations. The bulk wholesale sales and distribution channel requires minimal selling, administrative, and fulfillment costs. While we intend to pursue wholesale sales channels as a part of our adult-use and medical-use growth strategies in Canada, these sales are generally used to help balance inventory levels. 
 Our Commitment to Research and Innovation 
 We believe the strength of our medical brand is rooted in our commitment to research and development. Our research and development program focuses on developing: innovative and precisely formulated cannabinoid products; novel delivery systems; and processes and technologies that allow us to efficiently manufacture products on a large scale. 
 Patents and proprietary programs. Our commitment to innovation is key. We have filed approximately 50 patents in the fields of cannabis processing technology, formulation, composition, delivery system, and treatment methods. We have developed a number of innovative and proprietary programs designed to improve efficiency and overall product quality, including: a micro-propagation program that allows for the mass production of disease-free cannabis plants; methods and formulations to improve cannabinoid bioavailability and stability; a delivery platform to allow for the quick and efficient delivery of cannabinoids in formulations; fast preservation methods that allow for improved smell, texture and flavor of cannabis products; integrated pest management systems; and proprietary plant trimming machines to minimize manufacturing waste.
 Trademarks and trade dress. We invest heavily in our growing trademark portfolio and hold at least 80 approved or registered trademarks in a variety of countries, including Canada, the United States, the EU, Australia, Israel and several countries in South America and Asia. We also have at least 100 additional trademarks filed and pending in several countries throughout the world. Additionally, as a result of our brand licensing agreement with Docklight Brands, Inc., we have exclusive access in Canada to a number of strong marks, both registered and applied-for, including Marley Natural.
 Observational research program. We have implemented an extensive observational research program which includes large-scale prospective and cross-sectional studies in order to gather pre-clinical evidence on medical cannabis patient patterns of use, and the impact of that use on sleep, pain, mental health, quality of life, and the use of opioids/prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco and other substances. These studies include a biennial national Canadian Cannabis Patient Survey (“CCPS”), the Tilray Observational Patient Study (“TOPS”), and the Medical Cannabis in Older Patients Study (“MCOPS”). This research takes place in partnership with academic institutions in Canada and the United States, and several other countries, and has provided insight into the use of cannabis in the treatment of headaches/migraines, anxiety, and problematic substance use, and has led to a number of publications in high ranking academic journals, including the following:

 Clinical trials. Our participation in clinical trials differentiates our research and development program. We believe the development of clinical data on the use and impacts of properly defined cannabinoid products will increase mainstream acceptance within the medical community. To acquire this data, we provide pharmaceutical-grade Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) extracted from cannabis plants to select academic research partners conducting trials that meet regulatory agency standards. Our participation in clinical studies includes development of the Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls (“CMC”) documentation required by regulatory agencies, as well as assistance in designing the formulation of the study drug and the protocol of the clinical trials. In some instances, we provide funding for the trials and/or the pharmacokinetic data on the specific study drug. Although some trials, such as the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, or CINV, trial described below, are undertaken with an aim toward market authorization, most of the trials in which we participate generate early phase data used to support patent filings and prescribing data for physicians. We leverage our research by educating physicians about the unique benefits of cannabis-based medicines for treating various ailments. We believe our research and education efforts help promote the Tilray brand as the most trusted medical brand in the cannabis industry. Our Medical Advisory Board participates in the clinical trial selection process and provides us with additional credibility as a clinical trial participant.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in phases: Phase I establishes the safety and pharmacokinetics of the investigational study drug; Phase II provides additional information on the drug’s efficacy; and Phase III establishes the statistical significance of the study drug for the treatment of the disease or symptom over the placebo. Below is a list of the clinical trials in which we are currently involved.

Regulatory Environment 
 Canadian Medical and Adult-Use 
 Medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada is regulated under the federal Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations (“CR”) promulgated under the Cannabis Act. Both the Cannabis Act and CR came into force in October 2018, superseding earlier legislation that only permitted commercial distribution and home cultivation of medical cannabis. The following are the highlights of the current federal legislation:

• | a federal license is required for companies to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical or non-medical purposes. Health Canada, a federal government entity, is the oversight and regulatory body for cannabis licenses in Canada. As of December 31, 2020, Health Canada has issued approximately 570 active licenses to licensees under the CR (“Licensed Producers”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allows individuals to purchase, possess and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for medical purposes and, for individuals over the age of 18 years, for adult-use recreational purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables the provinces and territories to regulate other aspects associated with recreational adult-use. In particular; each province or territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products, and those laws may set lower maximum permitted quantities for individuals and higher age requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | promotion, packaging and labelling of cannabis is strictly regulated. For example, promotion is largely restricted to the place of sale and age-gated environments (i.e., environments with verification measures in place to restrict access to persons of legal age). Promotions that appeal to underage individuals are prohibited;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | since the current federal regime came into force on October 17, 2018, certain classes of cannabis, including dried cannabis and oils, have been permitted for sale into the medical and adult-use markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | following amendments to the CR that came into force on October 17, 2019 (often referred to as Cannabis 2.0 regulations), other non-combustible form-factors, including edibles, topicals, and extracts (both ingested and inhaled), are permitted in the medical and adult-use markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | export is restricted to medical cannabis, cannabis for scientific purposes, and industrial hemp; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sale of medical cannabis occurs on a direct-to-patient basis from a federally licensed provider, while sale of adult-use cannabis occurs through retail-distribution models established by provincial and territorial governments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All provincial and territorial governments have, to varying degrees, enacted regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of recreational adult-use cannabis within their jurisdiction, including minimum age requirements. The retail-distribution models for adult-use cannabis varies nationwide:
  
• | Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have adopted a government-run model for retail and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15

 
• | Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador have adopted a hybrid model with some aspects, including distribution and online retail being government-run while allowing for private licensed retail stores;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manitoba and Saskatchewan have adopted a private model, with privately-run retail stores and online sales, with distribution in Manitoba managed by the provincial government;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the three northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut have adopted a model that mirrors their government-run liquor distribution model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All provinces and territories have secured supply agreements from Licensed Producers for their respective markets. We are fulfilling adult-use supply agreements and purchase orders from various jurisdictions, consisting of: Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, and the Yukon.
 United States Regulation of Hemp 
 Hemp products are subject to state and federal regulation in respect to the production, distribution and sale of products intended for human ingestion or topical application. Hemp is categorized as Cannabis sativa L., a subspecies of the cannabis genus. Numerous unique, chemical compounds are extractable from Hemp, including THC and CBD. These cannabinoids are responsible for a range of potential psychological and physiological effects. Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, is distinguishable from marijuana, which also comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies, by its absence of more than trace amounts (0.3% or less) of the psychoactive compound THC. Although international standards vary, other countries, such as Canada, use the same THC potency standards to define Hemp. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA, under the FD&C Act, to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including products that contain Hemp extracts and derivatives, such as CBD. As a result, the FD&C Act will continue to apply to Hemp-derived food, drugs, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and devices introduced, or prepared for introduction, into interstate commerce. As a producer and marketer of Hemp-derived products, the Company must comply with the FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing and marketing of certain products, including food, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.
 As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law dictates that CBD derived from Hemp is not a controlled substance; however, CBD derived from Hemp may still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. Individual states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of Hemp-derived CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial Hemp activities, other states, however, maintain drug laws that do not distinguish between marijuana and Hemp and/or Hemp-derived CBD which results in Hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws. 
 European Union Medical Use 
 While each country in the EU has its own laws and regulations, many common practices are being adopted relative to the developing and growing medical cannabis market. For example, to ensure quality and safe products for patients, many EU countries only permit the import and sale of medical cannabis from GMP-certified manufacturers. 
 The EU requires adherence to GMP standards for the manufacture of active substances and medicinal products, including cannabis products. The EU system for certification of GMP allows a Competent Authority of any EU member state to conduct inspections of manufacturing sites and, if the strict GMP standards are met, to issue a certificate of GMP compliance that is also accepted in other EU member countries. 
 Competitive Conditions 
 As of December 31, 2020, Health Canada has issued approximately 570 active licenses to cannabis cultivators, processors and sellers. Health Canada licenses are limited to individual properties. As such, if a Licensed Producer seeks to commence production at a new site, it must apply to Health Canada for a new license. As of December 31, 2020, roughly 1,300 authorized retail cannabis stores have opened across Canada. As demand for 
 16

legal cannabis increases and the number of authorized retail distribution points increases, we believe new competitors are likely to enter the Canadian cannabis market. Nevertheless, we believe our brand recognition combined with the quality, consistency, and variety of cannabis products we offer will allow us to maintain a prominent position in the Canadian adult use and medical markets.
 We also expect more countries to pass regulation allowing for the use of medical and/or recreational cannabis. While expansion of the global cannabis market will provide more opportunities to grow our international business, we also expect to experience increased global competition.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we have 1,030 employees, located primarily in Canada, Portugal, Germany, the United States, and Australia. We consider relations with our employees to be good and have never experienced work stoppages. Aside from Portugal, none of our employees are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. In Portugal, none of our employees are represented by labor unions or are subject to any workforce-initiated labor agreements. As with all companies doing business in Portugal, we are subject to a government-mandated collective bargaining agreement which grants employees nominal additional benefits beyond those required by the local labor code.
 Tilray promotes an inclusive and employee-focused culture where we celebrate the diversity of our teams. We foster a collaborative and dynamic work environment providing all employees with the opportunity to work cross-functionally and easily gain exposure to other team’s diverse opinions and perspectives. We want every employee to reach their full potential and grow with Tilray.
 Our Company
