ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares,” “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and technologies that address patient needs in targeted therapeutic areas. We develop, manufacture and commercialize, for ourselves or with partners, novel therapeutic products using our advanced drug delivery systems that are designed to provide commercial or functional advantages such as improved safety and efficacy, convenience, improved tolerability, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence. We also seek product opportunities that complement and leverage our commercial platform. We have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered commercial products and ongoing product development programs in various stages of development. We have formed partnership arrangements with several different industry leading pharmaceutical companies. 
Our FDA-approved products include XYOSTED® (testosterone enanthate) injection; OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection, which was sold to Otter in December 2021; NOCDURNA® (desmopressin acetate), which is licensed from Ferring; and Sumatriptan Injection USP, which is distributed by Teva. We are also the exclusive supplier of devices to Teva for their Epinephrine Injection USP, the generic equivalent of EpiPen® and EpiPen® Jr.; the devices for Teva’s generic teriparatide; OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection to Otter beginning in December 2021; and of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injectors to Covis.
2021 Highlights and Areas of Focus
We achieved several significant operating and financial milestones in 2021:
•Record Revenue and Financial Results – We generated record revenue of $184.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing year-over-year growth of 23.0%. We generated record pre-tax income of $62.3 million resulting in net income and basic earnings per share of $46.3 million and $0.27, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net income and basic earnings per share of $56.2 million and $0.34, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.26 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.33 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Significant Growth of XYOSTED® – Our proprietary product XYOSTED® (testosterone enanthate) injection, indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, continued to grow significantly in 2021, generating annual net revenue of $62.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We attribute this 33.7% increase to successful marketing strategies, achieving and maintaining targeted reimbursement coverage, and our ability to continue to leverage our virtual capabilities to support the growth in 2021 despite the challenges presented by the Pandemic. XYOSTED® is the only FDA approved subcutaneous testosterone enanthate product for once-weekly, at-home self-administration of testosterone replacement therapy.
•Expanded Product Portfolio with In-License of TLANDO® – We entered into an exclusive license agreement with Lipocine for the product TLANDO® (testosterone undecanoate) in the U.S., a twice-daily oral formulation of testosterone for testosterone replacement therapy indicated for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, or hypogonadism in adult males. TLANDO® was granted tentative approval from the FDA in December 2020 and will be eligible for final FDA approval and marketing in the U.S. upon expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Clarus”) for JATENZO® on March 27, 2022. On February 3, 2022, we announced the FDA’s acceptance of our NDA resubmission for TLANDO® with a target action date set for March 28, 2022. We continue to prepare for the launch of TLANDO® in 2022 pending final FDA approval after the expiration of JATENZO®’s exclusivity period. 
•Aligned Proprietary Portfolio with Divestiture of OTREXUP® – We divested and sold our proprietary product line OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to Otter in December 2021 for a total purchase price of $44.0 million (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), subject to finalization of changes in closing inventory to be transferred. This divestiture allows us to further align our commercial detailing strategy to focus on the urology and endocrinology fields to enhance our growth strategy for XYOSTED®, NOCDURNA® and the anticipated launch of TLANDO® in 2022. With the asset sale, we will continue to manufacture and supply OTREXUP® to Otter as a partnered product.
•Significant Progress on Our Adrenal Crisis Rescue Pen (ATRS-1902) – We further advanced our ATRS-1902 development program with positive results from a Phase 1 clinical study for adrenal crisis and were granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. The results support the advancement of our ATRS-1902 development program to a pivotal clinical study for the treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency (“adrenal crisis”) in adults and adolescents, using our Vai™ novel proprietary rescue pen platform to deliver a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone. We anticipate starting this pivotal clinical study in the second quarter of 2022 and expect to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA with the FDA by the end of 2022 pending the success of the pivotal clinical study.
•Continued Navigation of the Global Pandemic – We have taken several measures to manage and minimize the impact of the Pandemic on our business. We have implemented safety measures and protocols to protect the health and safety of our employees and comply with governmental and public health guidelines while ensuring the sustainability of our business operations and continuity of product supply. We continue to monitor the situation, including the COVID-19 variants, and potential effects on our business, suppliers, partners and workforce. We have implemented a hybrid work environment with the ability to shift remote as necessary to limit the number of individuals in our facilities to those necessary for essential functions such as research, development, manufacturing and supply. While our field-based team has resumed in-person interaction with fewer restrictions, we believe we are also well-positioned with our virtual capabilities to continue to engage healthcare professionals and patients through the Pandemic and beyond.
In addition to these significant achievements and areas of focus in 2021, we continued to devote resources and advance our internal research and development programs to further expand our product pipeline. We also made significant progress on partnered development projects, made investments in capital improvements and infrastructure, and maintained a disciplined approach to growth and operating expenditures to support our continued and future growth.

For a detailed discussion of our proprietary and partnered approved and marketed products, and other products currently in development, see “Our Products” and “Research and Development” sections below included in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Information
Antares was incorporated under Delaware law in 2005 with principal executive offices located in Ewing, New Jersey. We have two wholly owned subsidiaries in Switzerland (Antares Pharma AG and Antares Pharma IPL AG) and operate under a single reportable operating segment, which encompasses all of our pharmaceutical products and technologies. Segment and geographic financial information are included in Note 2 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Strategy and Market Opportunity
Our strategy is to grow the business through targeted investments in internal and partnered product development and other corporate opportunities, as well as leverage our commercial infrastructure, primarily focused in certain therapeutic areas. We have built a robust commercial organization to market and sell our proprietary products and have significant experience in developing drug/device combination products and navigating the regulatory approval process.
Historically, our focus has been primarily the market for self-administered injectable drugs. We identify development and commercialization opportunities, both internally and through partnered or business development opportunities that apply patented drug delivery technologies to new or existing approved drug formulations. Through these opportunities, we seek to enhance the drug delivery methods and provide commercial and/or functional advantages, such as improved safety and efficacy, reduced side effects, convenience and enhanced patient comfort and adherence. In addition to self-administered injectable drugs, we explore opportunities beyond injectable drugs that may complement our strategy and leverage our capabilities. We pursue these opportunities both on our own or with partners. We believe this strategy offers a distinct value to patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical partners and our shareholders.
Injection is a common drug delivery pathway, and the delivery of pharmaceutical therapies through injection systems often improves the systemic bioavailability of those treatments by overcoming absorption barriers common with oral and, in some cases, transdermal delivery. Improved bioavailability is beneficial when evaluating the role of route of administration on pharmaceutical efficacy. We believe that our advanced injection technology platforms provide drug delivery solutions that can result in improved safety and efficacy, reduced side effects, and enhanced patient comfort and adherence. Many pharmaceutical companies focus on the development of important chronic care products and emergency rescue therapies that can be administered only by injection. We believe our advanced injection technologies uniquely address these market needs and are well suited for both the branded and generic marketplace.
We and our partners have historically sought, and are in the process of seeking, FDA approval for certain product candidates primarily using the 505(b)(2) NDA (New Drug Application) or ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) approval pathways, as well as more recently the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway with certain partners, which are further described in the “Government Regulation” section below included in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our technology platforms allow for device customization, which can provide multiple opportunities in both the 505(b)(2) NDA and generic market spaces, as well as the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway.
According to a Market Research Engine report, it is estimated that the global injectable drug delivery market will grow to $1.3 billion by 2024, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 12.9% in the forecast period. This expected growth is attributable to several factors, including label expansion for approved products, increasing the patient pool for such products, a pipeline of injectable medications at various stages of clinical development, and the increasing incidence of certain diseases that will necessitate the utilization of injectable medications.
See also “Our Products” and “Research and Development” below, included in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of market size and opportunities relative to the current therapeutic areas associated with our existing portfolio of products and products in development.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our key competitive strengths are our commercial capabilities and infrastructure, proprietary injection technologies, and our ability to form significant strategic alliances with industry-leading pharmaceutical partners to develop and commercialize products. We also believe our management team has unique knowledge of, and experience in the drug/device combination product space along with navigating the related regulatory approval process, which creates opportunities for us and potential pharmaceutical partners. Our business model for developing and commercializing proprietary and partnered products has been validated, we believe, by the successive FDA approvals of our NDAs for XYOSTED® and OTREXUP® and our ANDA for Sumatriptan Injection USP, as well as the FDA approval of Teva’s AB-rated generic version of the EpiPen®.
Intellectual Property, Patents, Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our competitive position. When appropriate, we seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and international patents and trademarks. We currently hold a portfolio of patents with expirations ranging from 2021 to 2038, and numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries. These patents consist primarily of design, formulation and method-of-use patents.
In addition to our patents and patent applications, our proprietary know-how and inventions play an important role in protecting our products and technologies, and provide protection beyond patents and regulatory exclusivity. We strive to preserve the confidentiality of our proprietary know-how and inventions by maintaining physical security of our sites and electronic security of our information technology systems. We also require all employees, contractors and third-party consultants with access to proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the Company. These agreements also require disclosure and assignment to us of discoveries and inventions made by such individuals while devoted to Company-sponsored activities. Partners with which we have entered into development agreements have the right to certain technology developed in connection with such agreements.
Human Capital
We believe that our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We currently have 201 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, of which 40 employees are based in our New Jersey corporate facility, 65 employees in our Minnesota operations and 98 employees based in the field. Our workforce includes 108 employees directly involved in or supporting our commercial sales organization, 27 in research and development, 37 in manufacturing and quality and 31 in corporate and administrative functions. We are not party to any collective bargaining arrangements. Although we believe that the size of our current workforce is appropriate to achieve our objectives, we may hire additional employees with specialized expertise as we continue to grow our business. We believe that we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific and business professionals.
We continue to focus on building a high performing organization with an engaging work culture and have established initiatives to support this strategic priority. We perform periodic employee engagement surveys, set and monitor retention goals, and intend to invest in training and leadership development to cultivate our emerging leaders. Additionally, we are committed to diversity and inclusion as a core focus of our human capital strategy. We embrace differences, diversity and varying perspectives amongst our employee base, and are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military or veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic established by federal, state or local laws. A diverse workforce, as well as an inclusive culture and work environment, are fundamentally important and strategic to us, beginning with our Board of Directors and extending to all levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2021, our total employee base was 56% diverse on the basis of gender and race. We also have implemented company-wide diversity and inclusion training.
We strongly believe that the success of Antares depends, in part, on open and regular communication with employees to help foster a high performing and engaged workforce. To help ensure that employees fully understand the Company’s long-term strategy and annual goals, along with how their work contributes to the Company’s success, we use a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly CEO Town Hall meetings; (ii) regular ongoing update communications; and (iii) employee engagement surveys.
We believe our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Talent management and leadership development is critical to our ability to execute on our long-term growth strategy. We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, discretionary broad-based stock grants and bonuses, health care and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. We also continue to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by complying with all applicable statutory filing requirements. To help support the development and advancement of our high performing employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continue to fill our team with strong and experienced management talent. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top talent throughout the organization.
Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, support the Company’s business strategies, and offer competitive compensation arrangements to attract and retain key individuals and therefore, have established a Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Consistent with this philosophy, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of our corporate performance in determining compensation for named executive officers, as well as each named executive officer’s individual performance, macroeconomic conditions, and data from peer group companies.
Our Technology and Product Platforms
Pressure assisted auto injection is a form of parenteral drug delivery that continues to gain acceptance and demand among the medical and patient community. Encompassing a wide variety of sizes and designs, our technology operates by using pressure to force the drug, in solution or suspension, through the skin and deposits the drug into the subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue. We have designed disposable, pressure assisted auto injector devices to address acute and chronic medical needs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, allergic reactions, migraine headaches, testosterone deficiency and maternal health. Our current platforms include the VIBEX® and the VIBEX® QuickShot® disposable pressure assisted auto injection systems, the Vai™ auto injector and disposable pen injection systems. 
VIBEX® Auto Injectors
Our proprietary VIBEX® disposable auto injector systems combine a spring-based power source with a shielded needle, which delivers the needed drug solution subcutaneously or intramuscularly. To minimize the anxiety and perceived pain associated with injection-based technologies, the VIBEX® system features a triggering collar that shields the needle from view. The patented retracting collar springs back and locks in place as a protective needle guard after the injection, making the device safe for general disposal. We believe the key competitive advantages of the VIBEX® system include: reliable subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, designed to work with conventional pre-filled syringes, rapid injection with ability to deliver viscous solutions, ease of use in emergencies, and reduced pain.
The primary goal of the VIBEX® disposable pressure assisted auto injector is to provide a fast, safe, and time-efficient method of self-injection. This device is designed around conventional single dose pre-filled syringes, which is a primary drug container, offering ease of transition for potential pharmaceutical partners. Our proprietary product OTREXUP® (product line, excluding the NDA, sold to Otter in December 2021) uses the VIBEX® auto injector system for delivery of methotrexate. We also have two license agreements with Teva for our VIBEX® system, one for Teva’s generic epinephrine auto injector and the other for our Sumatriptan Injection USP.
VIBEX® QuickShot® Auto Injectors
An advancement of our proprietary line of VIBEX® auto injectors is the VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector system, which offers a dose capacity of 1 mL or greater in a compact design. VIBEX® QuickShot® is designed to enhance performance on the attributes we believe most critical to patient acceptance, which are speed, comfort and discretion. VIBEX® QuickShot® achieves these advancements by incorporating a novel triggering mechanism and space-saving spring configuration. The unique design also accommodates fast injection of highly viscous drug products that less-powerful conventional auto injectors are typically unable to deliver. Many self-injectable drugs that are currently marketed or in clinical development are of higher viscosity and are formulated to be administered in a 1 mL dose volume. Our proprietary product XYOSTED®, and the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector that we developed with our partner Covis, were developed using the VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector platform. We also have a development agreement with Pfizer to develop a rescue pen utilizing our VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector system with an undisclosed Pfizer drug. In addition, we have a development agreement with Idorsia for a drug device combination product using a variation of our VIBEX® QuickShot® auto injector device with a new chemical entity selatogrel which is being developed for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.
Vai™ Auto Injector
We developed the versatile Vai™ auto injector platform to meet evolving market needs. The Vai™ auto injector builds off the capabilities of our VIBEX® and QuickShot® platforms adding automatic needle insertion, subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of up to 1 inch and delivered volumes of up to 2 mL. The Vai™ auto injector can accommodate 1 mL standard, 1 mL long, and 2.25 mL syringes. The auto-insert technology is intended to improve compliance for drug products requiring deep intramuscular injections. This innovative device is easily convertible to different fill volumes and needle lengths and was designed specifically to meet the reliability requirements for emergency use applications while maintaining the simple and intuitive two-step process of administration of the QuickShot® device.
Pen Injector System
Our multi-dose, disposable pen injector technology complements our portfolio of single-use pressure assisted auto injector devices. The disposable pen injector devices are designed to deliver drugs by injection through needles from multi-dose cartridges. Our disposable pen injectors are designed for chronic conditions such as diabetes, which require daily injection of a product. Depending on dosage, our pens can deliver up to thirty days of drug. We have licensed our pen injector device technology to Teva for two products in late-stage development: (i) a multi-dose pen with teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis (a generic form of Forteo®); and (ii) a multi-dose pen with exenatide for the treatment of diabetes (a generic version of BYETTA®). On February 25, 2022, Teva notified us that it was terminating the exenatide program and related agreement due to a lack of commercial viability. The termination is effective August 23, 2022.
Our Products
The following is a discussion of our approved and marketed commercial products, including proprietary and partnered products. For a discussion of other product candidates currently with tentative approval or in development, see the “Products with Tentative Approval” and “Research and Development” sections below included in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
XYOSTED® (testosterone enanthate) Injection
We market and sell in the U.S. our proprietary product XYOSTED® (testosterone enanthate) injection for subcutaneous administration of testosterone replacement therapy (“TRT”) in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. XYOSTED® is the only FDA approved subcutaneous testosterone enanthate product for once-weekly, at-home self-administration and is approved and marketed in three dosage strengths, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg. XYOSTED® provides an easy and virtually pain-free administration, low risk of transference and the ability to achieve and maintain steady levels of testosterone.
In the U.S., there are several different formulations for TRT including intramuscular injection, transdermal patches and gels, oral formulations and nasal gels. According to IQVIA National Sales Perspectives® (“NSP”) reporting of nationally projected sales activities, the overall U.S. TRT market was approximately $1.4 billion in 2021 based on wholesale acquisition costs (“WAC”). Total prescriptions in the U.S. TRT market grew by 5.1% to 8.0 million prescriptions in 2021 as compared to 2020, entirely driven by an increase in prescriptions of injectables, which increased by 5.4%. The injectable TRT market grew from $484.4 million in 2020 to $545.0 million in 2021, an increase of 12.5% based on WAC. As of December 2021, XYOSTED® commanded approximately 65% and 52% of the branded TRT market among Urologists and Endocrinologists, respectively.
Competition in the U.S. testosterone replacement market includes transdermal solutions such as AbbVie’s Androgel® 1% and 1.62%, Perrigo’s generic Androgel® Topical Gel, 1.62%, Eli Lilly’s Axiron®, Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® (and the authorized generic) and Allergan plc’s (“Allergan”) Androderm®. Other forms of TRT include injectables such as Endo’s Aveed®, Pfizer’s Depo®-Testosterone, and several generic oil testosterone products sold by Actavis, Sandoz, Viatris Inc., Teva and others, as well as Testopel® pellets by Endo and JATENZO®, an oral formulation, by Clarus. In addition, Marius Pharmaceuticals has submitted an NDA with the FDA for Kyzatrex, an oral formulation of testosterone, that is pending FDA approval.
OTREXUP® (methotrexate) Injection
Prior to December 2021, we marketed and sold in the U.S. our proprietary product OTREXUP® (methotrexate) injection. OTREXUP® is a subcutaneous methotrexate injection for once weekly self-administration with an easy-to-use, single dose, disposable auto injector, indicated for adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis.
In December 2021, we sold certain assets used in the operation of the OTREXUP® product to Otter under an Asset Purchase Agreement for a total purchase price of $44.0 million (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), subject to finalization of changes in closing inventory to be transferred. Pursuant to a separate supply agreement, Otter is responsible for supplying the pre-filled syringe of methotrexate and we will continue to manufacture and oversee the assembly and packaging of the final product which is sold to Otter as a partnered product. Further, we entered into a license agreement with Otter in which we granted Otter a worldwide, exclusive, fully paid-up license to certain patents relating to OTREXUP® that may also relate to our other products for Otter to commercialize and otherwise exploit OTREXUP® in the field as defined in the license agreement. 
The primary competitor in the RA market is Medexus Pharma which markets and sells Rasuvo®, a once-weekly, subcutaneous, single-dose auto-injector of methotrexate indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which is a direct competitor to OTREXUP®. Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. also recently received FDA approval and launched RediTrex®, a methotrexate injection in the U.S. Competition in the methotrexate market also includes tablets and parenteral dosage forms that are distributed in the U.S. by several generic manufacturers, including Teva, Pfizer, Viatris Inc. (“Viatris”), Hospira and Accord Healthcare. Beyond disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (“DMARDs”), other commonly used pharmaceutical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and biologic response modifiers. In addition to methotrexate, the other DMARDs include azathioprine (Imuran®), cyclosporine (Neoral®), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®), auranofin (Ridaura®), leflunomide (Arava®) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine®). The biologic response modifiers include etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), golimumab (Simponi®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), certolizumab (Cimzia®), infliximab (Remicade®), abatacept (Orencia®), and rituximab (Rituxan®).
NOCDURNA® (desmopressin acetate) Sublingual Tablets
We market and sell NOCDURNA® (desmopressin acetate) in the U.S., which is the first and only sublingual tablet indicated for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria (“NP”) in adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate. NOCDURNA® is a sublingual tablet, marketed in two dosage strengths, that dissolves quickly under the tongue without water and has been shown in clinical studies to reduce nighttime urination by nearly half (in patients who average three nighttime bathroom visits.) We license NOCDURNA® from Ferring. We began detailing NOCDURNA® with a soft launch in the fourth quarter of 2020 and reintroduced the product through a re-launch strategy to increase awareness and demand in the first quarter of 2021.
It is estimated that more than 50 million people in the U.S. are affected by nocturia, or frequent waking at night to urinate. Of the approximately 10 million patients diagnosed with nocturia, only about 1.5 million are treated for the condition. One of the leading causes of nocturia is nocturnal polyuria, which is present in up to 88% of nocturia patients. In patients diagnosed with nocturnal polyuria, the kidneys produce too much urine at night. Patients may already be taking medication for overactive bladder (“OAB”) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”); however, these medications may not reduce night-time urination because they do not treat NP.
Pharmacological therapy is most useful in treating nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria, including desmopressin, an anti-diuretic hormone therapy. The anti-diuretic effects of desmopressin are mediated by stimulation of vasopressin 2 (“V2”) receptors, thereby increasing water re-absorption in the kidney, and hence reducing urine production. Desmopressin is available as both an oral tablet and a nasal spray. Noctiva™, an FDA-approved nasal formulation of desmopressin acetate, although not currently marketed in the U.S., is the only other FDA-approved branded desmopressin acetate indicated for the treatment of nocturia.
Epinephrine Injection USP
We are the exclusive supplier of the device, which we developed, for Teva’s generic Epinephrine Injection USP products, indicated for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions including those that are life threatening (anaphylaxis) in adults and certain pediatric patients. Teva’s Epinephrine Injection, utilizing our patented VIBEX® injection technology, was approved by the FDA as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to the branded products EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® and therefore, subject to state law, substitutable at the pharmacy. We supply the device and Teva is responsible for the drug, assembly and packaging, distribution and commercialization of the finished product, for which we also receive royalties on Teva’s net sales.
Epinephrine is used for the treatment of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to insect venom, foods, drugs and other allergens as well as anaphylaxis to unknown substances or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Viatris’s EpiPen®, along with its own authorized generic of the product, continues to be the global market leader in the epinephrine auto injector market. In the U.S., sales of generic epinephrine injection products were approximately $1.66 billion in 2021 based on WAC, according to the IQVIA NSP report. There are other companies and alternative products competing in the U.S. market, including the authorized generic for Adrenaclick® marketed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kaléo’s AUVI-Q® (Epinephrine Injection, USP). Auto-Injector in the U.S. beginning in February 2017, Adamis Pharmaceuticals also received FDA approval of SYMJEPI®, an epinephrine injection, which is marketed and distributed in the U.S. by US WorldMeds LLC.
Sumatriptan Injection USP
We, through our partner Teva, sell Sumatriptan Injection USP, indicated in the U.S. for the acute treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headache in adults. Sumatriptan Injection USP is a generic equivalent to Imitrex® STATdose Pen®, and available in the 4 mg/0.5 mL and 6 mg/0.5 mL single-dose pre-filled syringe auto-injectors. We have a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva, under which Teva is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug, and we manufacture the device and complete assembly and packaging of the finished product. Teva is responsible for commercialization and distribution.
The total U.S. retail anti-migraine triptan market was $4.9 billion in 2021 according to IQVIA’s National Prescription Audit® (“NPA”) report based on TRx Pharmacy Dollars. The majority of patients who use triptans take oral tablets. Oral drugs accounted for $4.4 billion of the total, and injectable products accounted for approximately $257 million of the total market, measured in terms of TRx Pharmacy Dollars. Sumatriptan is currently available in an oral formulation, nasal spray and injectable. There is extensive competition in the anti-migraine marketplace and several manufacturers offer versions of injectable drugs with a delivery device, including GSK (Imitrex STATdose Pen®), Teva (AJOVY®), Pfizer (Alsuma), Endo International plc (Sumavel® DosePro®), Sun Pharma (generic sumatriptan autoinjector) and Upsher-Smith (Zembrace® SymTouch®). Sandoz, Inc. (“Sandoz”) also markets an authorized generic version of GSK’s Imitrex STATdose Pen®.
Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) Subcutaneous Auto Injector
We are the exclusive supplier of the device, a variation of our VIBEX® QuickShot® subcutaneous auto injector developed by us, for the progestin hormone drug Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection). The Makena® subcutaneous auto injector drug-device combination product is a ready-to-administer treatment indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past. The product was approved by the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We are the exclusive supplier of the devices and the final assembled and packaged commercial product.
Makena® is a progestin that belongs to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The active ingredient in Makena®, 17α hydroxyprogesterone caproate (often referred to as 17P), is the only FDA-approved treatment for pregnant women who have had a prior spontaneous preterm birth (which is a substantial risk factor for recurrent preterm birth) and has been and used for more than a decade by healthcare providers to treat patients with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. The approval of Makena® was based on the landmark Meis trial, conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2003. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012, which were affirmed in 2014. Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy being completed. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics, the percentage of preterm births affected approximately 10% of births in the U.S. in 2020.
In October 2019, Covis announced that the FDA’s Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee met to better understand and interpret the PROLONG (Progestin’s Role in Optimizing Neonatal Gestation) confirmatory clinical trial for Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) injection. Nine advisory committee members voted to recommend that the FDA pursue withdrawal of approval for Makena® and seven committee members voted to leave the product on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial. In October 2020, Covis received notice that the FDA is proposing to withdraw approval of Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection). Covis then formally requested a public hearing in response to the FDA’s proposal to withdraw its approval and has stated that it remains committed to working with the FDA to maintain patient access to Makena® as a treatment option to reduce pre-term birth. In August 2021, Covis announced the FDA had granted the request for a public hearing. A date for such meeting has not been set or announced by either the FDA or Covis.
Teriparatide Injection
We are the exclusive supplier of the multi-dose pen, which we developed, used in Teva’s generic teriparatide injection product. In 2020, our partner Teva launched Teriparatide Injection, the generic version of Eli Lilly’s branded product Forsteo® featuring the Antares multi-dose pen platform, for commercial sale in several countries outside of the U.S. Under an exclusive development, license and supply agreement with Teva, Antares is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of the multi-dose pen used in Teva’s generic teriparatide product and Teva is responsible for the sale and distribution of the product. Antares is compensated for devices sold to Teva and is entitled to receive royalties on net product sales by Teva in the territories.
Teriparatide is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture and for glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in men and women. According to Eli Lilly’s annual report, 2021 global sales of Forteo® were $801.9 million, of which $441.6 million was generated in the U.S.
Products with Tentative Approval
The following is a discussion of our products with tentative approval from the FDA. For a discussion of other approved and marketed commercial products, including proprietary and partnered products and product candidates currently in development, see the “Our Products” and “Research and Development” sections above and below, respectively, included in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TLANDO® (testosterone undecanoate) Oral Formulation
TLANDO® (testosterone undecanoate) is a twice daily oral formulation of testosterone for TRT indicated for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, or hypogonadism in adult males. TLANDO® was granted tentative approval from the FDA in December 2020 and will be eligible for final approval and marketing in the U.S. upon expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus for JATENZO® on March 27, 2022. On February 3, 2022, we announced the FDA’s acceptance of our NDA resubmission for TLANDO® in which the FDA designated the NDA as a Class 1 resubmission with a two-month review goal period and set a target action date of March 28, 2022. We continue to prepare for the launch of TLANDO® in 2022 pending final FDA approval after the expiration of JATENZO®’s exclusivity period.
In the U.S., there are several different formulations for TRT including intramuscular injection, transdermal patches and gels, oral formulations and nasal gel. According to IQVIA National Sales Perspectives® (“NSP”) reporting of nationally projected sales activities, the overall U.S. TRT market was approximately $1.4 billion in 2021 based on wholesale acquisition costs (“WAC”). Total prescriptions in the U.S. TRT market grew by 5.1% to 8.0 million prescriptions in 2021 as compared to 2020, entirely driven by an increase in prescriptions of injectables, which increased by 5.4%. The injectable TRT market grew from $484.4 million in 2020 to $545.0 million in 2021, an increase of 12.5% based on WAC.
Competition in the U.S. testosterone replacement market includes transdermal formulations such as AbbVie’s Androgel® 1% and 1.62%, Perrigo’s generic Androgel® Topical Gel, 1.62%, Eli Lilly’s Axiron®, Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® and Allergan plc’s (“Allergan”) Androderm®. Other forms of TRT include injectables such as Endo’s Aveed®, Pfizer’s Depo®-Testosterone, and several generic testosterone products sold by Actavis, Sandoz, Viatris Inc., Teva and others, as well as Testopel® pellets by Endo and JATENZO®, an oral formulation, by Clarus. In addition, Marius Pharmaceuticals has submitted an NDA with the FDA for Kyzatrex, an oral formulation of testosterone that is pending final approval.
Research and Development
We are committed to a strong research and development program, recognizing that the development of new product offerings is important to our future success. An important part of our growth strategy is our continued investment in our evolving research and development activities and new product pipeline. While we are focused on opportunities within urology and endocrinology therapeutic areas, we are also exploring new product opportunities beyond these therapeutic areas that could further grow and diversify our portfolio. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on leveraging our existing product and technology platforms by broadening their applications for use in other drug/device combination products, as well as exploring new pharmaceutical products, technologies and drug delivery methods. We also have a corporate development team that seeks and evaluates new business and product opportunities to further expand our pipeline.
Our research and development programs consist primarily of clinical, regulatory, formulation development, engineering and device development activities for our current products, next generation versions of current products, product extensions, and new proprietary and partnered products and technologies in development. Our internal research and development team works with external consultants, industry experts, physicians and other medical personnel in an effort to drive our product development pipeline. The following is a discussion of our significant research and development activities.
ATRS - 1901
We have initiated development of a proprietary drug device combination product for the urology oncology market, identified as ATRS-1901, and conducted formulation development work and non-clinical studies to help advance this program. In 2020, we received a response from the FDA regarding our pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) submission and believe we have determined our clinical and regulatory pathway forward. Our pre-clinical safety studies are ongoing.
ATRS - 1902
We have identified a program to develop a proprietary drug device combination product for the endocrinology market, an adrenal crisis pen, identified as ATRS-1902. The development program supports a proposed indication for the treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency, known as adrenal crisis, in adults and adolescents, using a novel proprietary auto-injector platform to deliver a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone. We have conducted initial formulation work and developed a working prototype of a new device to support this program. 
In June 2021, we submitted an IND application with the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study of ATRS-1902 for adrenal crisis rescue. The IND application includes the protocol for an initial clinical study to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of our novel formulation of hydrocortisone versus Solu-Cortef®, which is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid and is the current standard of care for the management of acute adrenal crises.
In July 2021, the FDA accepted our IND for ATRS-1902 enabling us to initiate our Phase 1 clinical study. The Phase 1 clinical study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (“PK”) of a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone was initiated in September 2021. The study is a cross-over design to establish the PK profile of ATRS-1902 (100 mg) compared to Solu-Cortef® (100 mg), the reference-listed drug, in 32 healthy adults. After this study is completed, we expect to conduct a bioequivalence study and second human factor study utilizing our proprietary auto-injector technology. 
In January 2022, we announced the positive results from the Phase 1 clinical study and were granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. The positive results support the advancement of our ATRS-1902 development program to a pivotal study for the treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency, known as adrenal crisis, using our Vai™ novel proprietary rescue pen platform to deliver a liquid stable formulation of hydrocortisone. We anticipate starting this pivotal study in adults in the second quarter of 2022 and expect to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA with the FDA by the end of 2022 pending the success of the study, a further human factors study and confirmation of the product stability from our ongoing stability program.
ATRS-1903
We have initiated development of a proprietary drug device combination product utilizing our rescue pen technology for a rare immunology disorder, identified as ATRS-1903. Formulation development work has been conducted and we anticipate progressing this towards initial clinical testing to evaluate PK and tolerability in human subjects.
Additional Development Programs
We continue to pursue and evaluate other potential new products and product extensions that address patient needs primarily in targeted therapeutic areas. We explore new development opportunities including innovative delivery technologies and improved formulations of existing therapeutics.
Partnered Development Projects
We, in collaboration with our pharmaceutical partners, are engaged in research and development activities utilizing our auto injectors and disposable pen injectors. The development programs typically consist of determination of the device design, development of prototype tooling, production of prototype devices for testing and clinical studies, and development of commercial tooling and assembly. We expect development related to these products to continue; however, the development timelines are generally controlled by our partners and the extent of near-term and future development will be dependent on decisions made by our partners. The following is a summary of the development stages for select partnered products in development:
Pen Injector with Teriparatide
We are developing with Teva, under a license, development and supply agreement, a multi-dose disposable pen injector device with teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis. Teva is working toward a regulatory approval with the FDA for a generic version of Forteo® (teriparatide rDNA origin injection) using the ANDA pathway. See also the “Teriparatide Injection” section above for more information about the product and Teva’s commercialization activities outside the U.S.
Pen Injector with Exenatide
We were developing with Teva a multi-dose pen injector device for use with a generic form of BYETTA® (exenatide injection) for the treatment of diabetes. Teva was working through the U.S. regulatory approval process for its exenatide pen using the ANDA pathway. On February 25, 2022, Teva notified us that it was terminating the exenatide program and related agreement due to a lack of commercial viability. The termination is effective August 23, 2022.
Rescue Pen (drug undisclosed)
In August 2018, we entered into a development agreement with Pfizer and began developing a combination drug device rescue pen. This rescue pen will use the Antares QuickShot® auto injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. In 2021, we continued to work on this development program, and we expect to continue development of this product candidate.
Rescue Device with Selatogrel
In November 2019, we entered into a new global agreement with Idorsia to develop a novel, drug-device product containing selatogrel. A new chemical entity, selatogrel, is being developed for the treatment of a suspected acute myocardial infarction (“AMI”) in adult patients with a history of AMI. Idorsia will pay for the development of the combination product and will be responsible for applying for and obtaining global regulatory approvals for the product. The parties intend to enter into a separate commercial license and supply agreement pursuant to which we will provide fully assembled and labelled product to Idorsia at cost plus mark-up. Idorsia will then be responsible for global commercialization of the product, pending FDA or foreign approval. We will be entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the commercial product.
In 2020, we completed the initial design phase of the selatogrel device and Idorsia conducted a clinical bridging study utilizing these devices. We completed the usability and reliability studies for the device which has been tailored for emergency use ahead of the Phase 3 study.
According to publications by Idorsia, two Phase 2 studies in patients with stable coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction, respectively, have met their pharmacodynamic objectives of significantly inhibiting platelet aggregation. Subcutaneous administration of selatogrel 8 mg and 16 mg has demonstrated a rapid onset of action, within 15 minutes, with the height of its effect extending over 4-8 hours, depending on the dose. Selatogrel was safe and well tolerated in both studies and there were no treatment-emergent serious bleeds.
 In December 2020, the FDA designated Idorsia’s investigation of selatogrel for the treatment of a suspected AMI in adult patients with a history of AMI as a “fast-track” development program. This designation is intended to promote communication and collaboration between the FDA and pharmaceutical companies for drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.
In June 2021, Idorsia announced they initiated its Phase 3 registration study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of self-administered subcutaneous selatogrel, Idorsia’s P2Y12 receptor antagonist, in suspected AMI using Antares’ QuickShot® auto-injector. The study is an international, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of 16 mg of selatogrel when self-administered (on top of standard-of-care) upon occurrence of symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction. The primary efficacy endpoint is the occurrence of death from any cause, or non-fatal AMI after any study treatment self-administration. The study will enroll approximately 14,000 patients who are at high risk of recurrent AMI, at approximately 250 sites in approximately 30 countries. A Special Protocol Assessment has been agreed with the FDA for Idorsia’s selatogrel, which indicates the FDA is in agreement with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints and planned analyses) for a study intended to support a future marketing application.
According to the American Heart Association, the overall prevalence for myocardial infarction in the U.S. is about 7.9 million adults. There are also approximately 805,000 heart attacks in the U.S. annually, of which 605,000 are first heart attacks and 200,000 happen to people who have already had a heart attack according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Manufacturing
We use third parties to manufacture our products and product candidates, including the products and related components we supply to our partners. For our products and product candidates, we must ensure they are manufactured in accordance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) for drug products and FDA’s current Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”) for medical devices and equivalent provisions in the European Union (“EU”) and elsewhere, which are required as part of the overall obligations necessary. We believe that our third-party manufacturers are currently in compliance with cGMPs, QSRs and foreign equivalents, to the extent applicable. Assembly and packaging of our products and product candidates is performed by third-party service providers under our direction. All manufacturers and suppliers are monitored and evaluated by our quality department to assess compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal quality standards and benchmarks. We perform quality reviews of manufacturing for all of our product candidates and products, and quality releases for all of our product candidates and products that we sponsor or commercialize.
We use a range of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and supply certain components, drugs, final assembly and finished product. Below is a summary of our key production, manufacturing, assembly and packaging arrangements with third-party manufacturers for products commercialized by us and our partners:
•We have contracted with Phillips-Medisize Corporation (“Phillips”), an international outsource provider of design and manufacturing services, to produce commercial quantities of our QuickShot® auto injector device for XYOSTED®, our QuickShot® auto injector device for the Makena® product with Covis, and our VIBEX® epinephrine auto injector product with Teva.

•We use Sharp Corporation (“Sharp”), an international contract packaging company, to assemble and package XYOSTED®, Sumatriptan Injection USP and the Makena® auto injector products, and the OTREXUP® auto injector product for Otter®.
Below is a summary of our key production, manufacturing, assembly and packaging arrangements with third-party manufacturers for TLANDO®:
•We use Pfizer to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”).
•We have contracted with NextPharma, an international pharmaceutical manufacturing company, to supply the bulk capsule product.
•We use PCI Pharma Services (“PCI”), an international contract packaging company, to assemble and package TLANDO®.
We have an experienced quality group that works with and regularly inspects or meets with our manufacturers and suppliers to review the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, and to provide input on quality matters.
In addition to the above manufacturing capabilities, on July 1, 2019, we entered into a lease for approximately 75,000 square feet of office, laboratory, manufacturing and warehousing space in Minnetonka, Minnesota. We completed the build-out of the facility and began occupying the space in 2020. The new facility supports our administrative functions, product development and quality operations and is intended to provide additional manufacturing and warehousing capabilities in the future.
Commercial Operations
We have built a robust internal commercial organization, consisting of specialty sales representatives, management and support staff, to market and sell our proprietary products XYOSTED®, OTREXUP® and NOCDURNA® in the U.S. As of December 2021, commercialization and distribution of OTREXUP® is the responsibility of Otter in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement. In anticipation of final FDA approval, we are preparing to launch TLANDO® in 2022. We have entered into agreements with vendors for certain commercialization services such as third-party logistics, distribution, data analytics and claims processing. We have and may continue to enter into licensing and or additional distribution arrangements for commercialization of our products outside the U.S.
Distribution – We have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, Cardinal Health 105, Inc., also known as Specialty Pharmaceutical Services (“Cardinal”), for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, distribution, contract administration and chargeback processing, accounts receivable management and call center management. We also use a division of Cardinal for sample administration. In addition, we use third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services.
Trade – We contract with numerous wholesale distributors, including Cardinal, McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”) and AmerisourceBergen Corporation to distribute our proprietary products to retail pharmacies as well as the Veterans Administration and other governmental agencies. In addition to shipping our product, these distributors provide inventory and sales reports as well as other services. In exchange for these services, we pay fees to certain distributors based on a percentage of wholesale acquisition cost. We have also contracted with several specialty pharmacies to support fulfillment of certain prescriptions.
Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing – In the U.S., sales of pharmaceutical products to consumers depend to a significant degree on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of products and services and implementing other cost containment mechanisms, including demanding more aggressive pricing and rebates for favorable formulary placement. This is especially true in markets where generic options exist. Third-party payers often use a tiered reimbursement system and may require step edits or prior authorization. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek and maintain coverage for our products and to process reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare and private payers.
Participation in the Medicaid program requires payment of statutory rebates on unit dispenses. Some states have also created Medicaid preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. Some States have implemented statutes imposing other consequences for a manufacturer’s failure in certain circumstances to negotiate supplemental rebates, including but not limited to, ordering managed care plans to limit or reduce reimbursement for a drug provided by a medical practitioner. If our products are not included on these preferred drug lists, they may be subject to prior authorization.
Similarly, in order to ensure coverage by Medicare Part D and commercial pharmacy benefit plans, we participate in certain rebate programs, which provide discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the third-party administrator of the program. We also provide discounts to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration under an FSS contract negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including discounts mandated by the Veterans Health Care Act, discounted prescriptions to Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) Tricare retail pharmacy program, and statutory discounts to federal grantees and safety net providers referred to as covered entities pursuant to our pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services and the 340B drug discount program, which is required as a condition of Medicaid coverage. Government agencies ordering under the FSS and covered 340B entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at the discounted price, and the wholesale distributors then charge back the difference between the current wholesale acquisition cost and the price the entity paid for the product.
We also offer co-pay assistance programs to patients for our proprietary products under which patients covered by commercial pharmacy benefit plans receive discounts on their prescriptions. Our XYOSTED® STEADYCare Co-pay Assistance Program provides financial support to most commercially insured patients to assist with out-of-pocket costs of XYOSTED®. In addition, certain commercially insured patients are eligible for our “first fill free” program for XYOSTED® to assist the patient during the initial claims adjudication process. Similar to XYOSTED®, we offer a co-pay assistance program for NOCDURNA®, which also provides financial support to most commercially insured patients to assist with out-of-pocket costs. We use contract service providers to process and pay claims to patients for actual usage. We also offer the ability for patients who do not have insurance, or whose insurance does not cover our proprietary products, the ability to purchase either XYOSTED® or NOCDURNA® with a valid prescription at a cash price via a specialty pharmacy.
International Distribution – We are contracting with a third-party logistics provider, Cardinal, for key services related to logistics, warehousing and inventory management, international shipping, export and customs administration to support our international distributor, Lunatus. We entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Lunatus in August 2020 to distribute and promote the sale of XYOSTED® in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Lunatus is responsible for obtaining regulatory approval and, assuming approval, for the promotion and commercialization of the product in the territories.
Sales, Marketing & Distribution of Partnered Products
Our partnered products may encounter some of the same reimbursement issues described above, and although we do not control the reimbursement rate or discounts contracted with third-party payers by our partners, it ultimately affects our royalty payments we receive on net sales. The industry has experienced an increasingly widening gap between gross sales and net sales after discounts.
Epinephrine Injection USP – We are the exclusive supplier of the device used in Teva’s epinephrine injection product. We receive payment for each device sold to Teva and royalties on Teva’s commercial sales of the product. Teva’s epinephrine injection was approved as a generic drug product with an AB rating, meaning that it is therapeutically equivalent to Viatris Inc.’s branded products EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr® and therefore, subject to state law, is substitutable at the pharmacy. Teva is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.
Makena® Subcutaneous Auto Injector – We are the exclusive supplier of the device used in the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector. We receive payment for each device sold to Covis and royalties on Covis’ commercial sales of the product. Covis primarily sells Makena® to specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, home infusion companies and pharmacies which, in turn, sell Makena® to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems. Covis is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.
Sumatriptan Injection USP – We are the exclusive supplier of the product containing sumatriptan which is commercialized by Teva. We are compensated at cost for shipments of product to Teva. In addition, net profits from sales of the product, after deduction of product sales allowances such as discounts, rebates and chargebacks, are split 50/50 between us and Teva. Teva is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.
Teriparatide Injection – We are the exclusive supplier of the pen injection device used in Teva’s Teriparatide Injection product outside the U.S. Teva launched its generic version of Forsteo® in certain territories outside the U.S. in 2020. We receive payment for each device sold to Teva and royalties on Teva’s commercial sales of the product in the territories. Teva is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.
OTREXUP® (methotrexate) Injection – Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, license agreement and supply agreement, we are the exclusive supplier of the device used in OTREXUP® beginning in December 2021. We receive payment for each device sold to Otter. Otter is solely responsible for commercialization and distribution of the finished product.

In July 2006, we entered into an exclusive license, development and supply Agreement with Teva for an epinephrine auto injector product to be marketed in the U.S. and Canada. Pursuant to the agreement, Teva is obligated to purchase all of its delivery device requirements from us. We received an upfront cash payment and a milestone payment upon FDA product approval. We also receive a negotiated purchase price for each device sold, as well as royalties on Teva’s commercial sales of the product. This agreement has been amended to provide for payment of capital equipment and other ongoing development work that was outside the scope of the original agreement. The agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent that is filed no later than 12 months after FDA approval. We have multiple patents that have been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Officer (“USPTO”) that cover this product, the latest of which will expire in 2033. We have and plan to continue to file patent applications covering this product.
In December 2007, we entered into a license, development and supply agreement with Teva under which we developed and will supply a disposable pen injector for two therapeutic products: exenatide and teriparatide. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and development milestones, and may receive royalties on future product sales. This agreement has been amended numerous times and provides for payment of capital equipment and other development work that was outside the scope of the original agreement. This agreement will continue until the expiration date of the last to expire patent covering the device or product that is filed no later than 12 months after FDA approval and will be automatically renewed for successive periods of two years each. Currently, the expiration date of the last to expire patent is 2035. On February 25, 2022, Teva notified us that it was terminating the exenatide program and related agreement due to a lack of commercial viability. The termination is effective August 23, 2022.
In November 2012, we entered into a license, supply and distribution agreement with Teva for an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines. Under the agreement, we received an upfront payment and a milestone payment upon commercial launch. Teva is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug, and we are responsible for the manufacture and supply of the device and assembly and packaging of the finished product. We are compensated at cost for product shipment to Teva and Teva distributes the product in the U.S. Teva also received an option for distribution rights in other territories. In addition, net profits are split 50/50 between us and Teva. The term of the agreement continues seven years from commercial launch, which was in June 2016, with automatic one-year renewals unless terminated sooner by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
Covis Agreements
In September 2014, we entered into a development and license agreement with Lumara Health, Inc., which was subsequently acquired by AMAG, which was subsequently acquired by Covis, to develop and supply an auto injector system for use with Makena®, a progestin drug (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth. Under the agreement, we granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, and received an upfront payment for our license and development activities. We are also entitled to milestone payments upon the achievement of pre-determined amounts of net sales of the product.
Covis was responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications, and is responsible for the manufacture and supply of the drug to be used in the product, and to market, distribute and sell the product. We are the exclusive supplier of the auto injection system devices for the product and are responsible for the manufacture and supply of the devices and final assembly and packaging of the finished product. Under the arrangement, we receive payment for each device, and royalties based on net sales of products commencing on product launch in a particular country until the product is no longer developed, marketed, sold or offered for sale in such country. The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of products and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the auto injector product being sold in a particular country.
In March 2018, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Covis for the exclusive supply of the devices and fully assembled and packaged final finished product of the Makena® subcutaneous auto injector. The term of the agreement is concurrent with the term of the development and license agreement and will continue until such time as commercialization of the product is halted. We receive a contracted price per unit on each product manufactured.
Pfizer Agreement
In August 2018, we entered into a development agreement with Pfizer to jointly develop a combination drug device rescue pen. This rescue pen will use the Antares QuickShot® auto injector and an undisclosed Pfizer drug. In 2021, we continued to work on this development program, and we expect to continue development of this product candidate.
Idorsia Agreement
In November 2019, we entered into a new global agreement with Idorsia to develop a novel, drug-device product containing selatogrel. A new chemical entity selatogrel is being developed for the treatment of a suspected AMI in adult patients with a history of AMI. Idorsia will pay for the development of the combination product and will be responsible for applying for and obtaining global regulatory approvals for the product. The parties intend to enter into a separate commercial license and supply agreement pursuant to which Antares will provide fully assembled and labelled product to Idorsia at cost plus mark-up. Idorsia will then be responsible for global commercialization of the product, pending FDA or foreign approval. Antares will be entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the commercial product.
Ferring Agreement
In October 2020, we entered into an exclusive license and commercial supply agreement with Ferring for the marketed product NOCDURNA® (desmopressin acetate) in the U.S., which is indicated for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria (NP) in adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate. Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company paid Ferring an upfront payment of $5.0 million upon execution and paid an additional $2.5 million on October 1, 2021. Ferring is eligible for tiered royalties and additional commercial milestone payments potentially totaling up to $17.5 million based on our net sales of NOCDURNA® in the U.S.
Lipocine Agreement
In October 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Lipocine for the product TLANDO® (testosterone undecanoate) in the U.S., a twice-daily oral formulation of testosterone for testosterone replacement therapy indicated for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, or hypogonadism in adult males. TLANDO® was granted tentative approval from the FDA in December 2020 and will be eligible for final approval and marketing in the U.S. upon expiration of the exclusivity period previously granted to Clarus for JATENZO® on March 27, 2022. On February 3, 2022, we announced the FDA’s acceptance of our NDA resubmission for TLANDO® with a target action date set for March 28, 2022. We continue to prepare for the launch of TLANDO® in 2022 pending final FDA approval after the expiration of JATENZO®’s exclusivity period. Under the terms of the license agreement, we paid Lipocine an upfront payment of $11.0 million. Lipocine is eligible for additional milestone payments up to $10.0 million and tiered royalty and commercial milestones based on net sales of TLANDO® in the U.S. We will be responsible for the manufacturing and commercialization of TLANDO®.
The license agreement also grants us the option to license and develop LPCN 1111 (TLANDO XR) in the U.S., a potential once daily oral testosterone product containing testosterone tridecanoate in development for the treatment of hypogonadism in adult males. Results of the Phase 2b study for TLANDO XR met its primary endpoints, including identifying the dose expected to be tested in a Phase 3 study. TLANDO XR was well tolerated with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events reported and the target Phase 3 dose also met its primary and secondary endpoints in the Phase 2b study. TLANDO XR is an investigational drug containing tridecanoate and has not been approved by the FDA, nor has the name been approved. If elected, upon exercise of the option, we will be required to pay an additional $4.0 million in license fees in two installments and will be responsible for additional development and commercial milestone payments as well as tiered royalties on net sales of TLANDO XR in the U.S. In addition, we will be responsible for completing the development program including the conduct of a Phase 3 clinical trial and applying for regulatory approval in the U.S.
Otter Agreement
In December 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Otter to sell certain worldwide assets used in the operation of the OTREXUP® product line for $44.0 million, subject to finalization of changes in closing inventory to be transferred, and a license agreement for rights to commercialize OTREXUP®. Simultaneously, we entered into a supply agreement with Otter to manufacture the VIBEX® auto-injection system device, designed and developed to incorporate a pre-filled syringe for delivery of methotrexate, assemble, package, label and supply the final OTREXUP® product and related samples to Otter at cost plus mark-up. Otter is responsible for manufacturing, formulation and testing of methotrexate and the corresponding pre-filled syringe for assembly with the device manufactured by us, along with the commercialization and distribution of OTREXUP®.
Seasonality of Business
Certain parts of our business may be affected by seasonality. Customer purchases have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year due to the resetting of high-deductible health insurance plans. Seasonality affects quarterly comparisons within any fiscal year; however, we believe this impact is generally not material to our annual consolidated results. Our revenues may be influenced by many factors, including regulatory and reimbursement approvals, timing of product launches, acquisitions or divestitures, holiday schedules, and other macro-economic conditions. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have a wide range of competitors depending upon the branded or generic marketplace, the therapeutic product category, and the product type, including dosage strengths and route of administration. Our competitors include established specialty pharmaceutical companies, major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals such as Teva, Viatris, Eli Lilly and Endo, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. Our competitors also include third party contract medical device design and development companies such as Scandinavian Health Ltd., Ypsomed AG, West Pharmaceutical and Owen Mumford Ltd. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. Smaller or early stage emerging companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Branded products not only face competition from other brands, but also from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefit management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically command higher prices initially. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. As a result, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost-efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality manufacturing capabilities.
Industry Trends
Based upon our experience, we believe the following significant trends have important implications for the growth of our business. Recent trends in the pharmaceutical industry include merger and acquisition activity leading to further market consolidation. In many cases, the resulting combined pharmaceutical companies are bigger and have more financial, technical and market strength and greater resources, which increases competitive pressure in the industry.
There is ongoing effort by public and private payers to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the overall cost of health care. There continues to be greater pressure on drug manufacturers to provide greater discounts and rebates on their products. The drug distribution channels are complex and involve many different parties. Recently, such channels have undergone and continue to undergo consolidation. Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have merged or consolidated resulting in significantly larger organizations with greater resources and bargaining power controlling multiple levels of the drug distribution network. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are facing increasing pressure to reduce prices. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. Large wholesalers and retailer customers have continued to form partnerships. As a result of this consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market.
Government Regulation
Any potential products discovered, developed and manufactured by us or our collaborative partners must comply with comprehensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by comparable authorities in other countries. These national agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, effectiveness, approval, manufacturing operations, quality, labeling, distribution, controlled substance security, export, import, storage, record keeping, safety and other reporting, sampling, advertising, marketing, and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. Facilities and certain company records are also subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable authorities or their representatives.
The FDA has broad discretion in enforcing the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and the regulations thereunder, and noncompliance can result in a variety of regulatory enforcement actions ranging from warning letters, product detentions, device alerts or field corrections to recalls, seizures, manufacturing shut downs, quarantines, refusal of the government to approve NDAs or ANDAs, or supplements to the same, clinical holds, injunctive actions, withdrawal of approvals, civil or criminal actions or penalties, disgorgement, adverse publicity, labeling revisions, dear healthcare provider letters, FDA debarment, exclusion from Federal healthcare programs, contract debarment or refusal of future orders under existing government contracts, consent decrees, and corporate integrity agreements. Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Drug Approval Process
FDA approval of our own and our partners’ products is required before the products may be commercialized in the U.S. Section 505 of the FFDCA describes three regulatory pathways for marketing authorization for a new drug:
•A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that is used for the approval of a new drug that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness.
•A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This alternate route for regulatory approval permits the applicant to rely in part upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for previously approved products and/or published scientific literature.
•Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug, which has the same labeling, performance, characteristics, and intended use as the listed drug, and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are generally required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug, pursuant to state laws.
For both NDAs and ANDAs, the FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, safety, potency, and purity. The following table provides a summary description of the various regulatory pathways:

 | ANDA | 505(b)(2) NDA | 505(b)(1) NDA 
Clinical Trials/Testing Required | Generally, bioequivalence. | Yes, to address potential differences between the branded reference product and the 505(b)(2) product, as well as bridging studies. | Yes, full reports of safety and efficacy. 
Results in Orange Book Listed Patents | No | Yes, for novel formulations, other enhancements and new indications. | Yes 
Exclusivity | Potential for 180 days against other generic filers if first generic to file a substantially complete application containing a paragraph IV certification that is lawfully maintained. | Potential for 30-month stay if ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant citing our or our partners’ product as a reference listed drug includes a paragraph IV certification. Also, potential for three- or five-year exclusivity, like 505(b)(1) NDAs. | Potential of five years for a new chemical entity, or three years for new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) that are essential to approval of the application. Potential for 30-month stay if ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant citing our or our partners’ product as a reference listed drug includes a paragraph IV certification.
Patent Certification Required | Yes | Yes | No 
Potential Orphan Drug Designation Drug Status | No | Yes | Yes 

NDA Submission
The process required by the FDA before a new drug pharmaceutical product or a change to an already approved pharmaceutical product, may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally involves:
•pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must be in effect before clinical trials may begin;
•adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended indication(s);
•development of manufacturing processes to ensure the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•FDA compliance inspections and/or clearance of all manufacturers and facilities, as well as select clinical trial sites; and
•FDA review of the NDA in order to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, to support human clinical trials along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, available scientific literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In the case of drug product candidates for which the sponsor will seek marketing approval via a 505(b)(2) NDA application, some of the above information may be abbreviated or omitted.
IND applications automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. If the FDA places a trial on clinical hold, the sponsor must address the issue to the FDA’s satisfaction before the trial may begin. In addition, an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) must review, approve and monitor the plan for any clinical trial, subject communications, and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial, place a trial on hold or discontinue a trial at any time on various grounds.
Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocols must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRB for approval. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found.
Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results within set timeframes, with the exception of PK studies. Failure to submit the required information to ClinicalTrials.gov can result in monetary penalties. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to enable sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Moreover, under the 21st Century Cures Act, manufacturers or distributors of investigational drugs for the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must have a publicly available policy concerning expanded access to investigational drugs.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients in accordance with the applicable protocol and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases, which may overlap, though in the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, some study requirements may be abbreviated. Studies, in addition to the below, such as pediatric studies, may also be required by the FDA:
•Phase I – During Phase I, when the drug is initially given to human subjects, the product is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Phase I studies are often conducted with healthy volunteers depending on the drug being tested. If possible, Phase I trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness.
•Phase II – Phase II involves controlled studies in a limited patient population, typically patients with the conditions needing treatment, to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications; determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
•Pivotal or Phase III – Adequate and well-controlled trials are undertaken in Phase III in order to evaluate efficacy and safety in a comprehensive fashion within an expanded patient population for seeking approval of the new drug. Typically, two Phase III trials are required by FDA for product approval.
In the case of 505(b)(2) NDAs, the above studies may be abbreviated. Following marketing approval, sponsors may also voluntarily or be required to conduct additional studies, called Phase IV studies.
In some cases, FDA programs may be available to expedite or simplify the process of drug development and FDA marketing application review. For instance, drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to the FDA’s prior review of promotional materials. Accelerated approval products are also required to conduct rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. If the FDA proposes withdrawing an accelerated approval, the agency provides the applicant with an opportunity for a hearing. If the applicant files a timely request for a hearing, the applicant must submit any data and information to the FDA upon which it plans to rely. At the hearing, an advisory committee is asked to review the applicable issues and provide advice and recommendations to the FDA.
Sponsors may also request that a product be designated under the FDA’s fast track program. Under this program, products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, if so designated by the FDA, are eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast-track product may be eligible for other FDA programs intended to expedite product development and approval for serious and life-threatening diseases. Notably, however, such designations and programs may be withdrawn by the FDA and such designations and programs do not guarantee that a product will ultimately be successfully developed or approved for marketing.
Another program that is intended to facilitate development is the special protocol assessment (“SPA”) program. Under this program, a sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment, or SPA to reach agreement with the FDA on certain studies. If a written agreement is reached regarding the applicable study protocol, the agreement will be binding on the FDA and the protocol may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The results of drug development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances.
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review and will be accepted for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review 90% of all applications for non-New Molecular Entities (“NMEs”) within ten months from the submission date. For NMEs, the FDA has the goal of completing its review of 90% of applications within ten months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA, however, may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months of the submission date for non-NMEs and within six months of the 60-day filing date for NMEs. These timeframes, however, are only goals, which the FDA may not meet. Moreover, the review process may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides substantial additional information or clarification regarding the submission.
The FDA may also choose or be required to refer drugs to advisory committees when it is determined that an advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial to the regulatory decision-making process, including the evaluation of new technology. An advisory committee is a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter authorizing marketing for specific conditions, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) describing the application deficiencies. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission.
If a product meets the FDA’s approval standards but the approval of the product cannot be made effective before the expiration of patents or exclusivities held by the reference listed drug, the FDA may issue a tentative approval letter to the applicant. Under these circumstances, the FDA delays the final approval of the product until all patent or exclusivity issues have been resolved. Products with tentative approvals may not be marketed until the FDA issues a final approval. Following a tentative approval, applicants may amend their application; however, amendments may delay the FDA’s ability to finalize the approval as the FDA must review and approve the amendment. In order to obtain final approval, the applicant must submit a request to the FDA for final approval (which we did for TLANDO® on January 28, 2022 with acceptance by the FDA announced on February 3, 2022). The FDA’s review of requests for final approval may take a number of months and depends on the content of the request and the kind of application. Even if a product has received tentative approval, there is no guarantee that the product will receive final approval, as new information may emerge that changes the FDA’s prior determination.
ANDA Submissions
A pharmaceutical company seeking to market a generic version of a branded drug must file an ANDA with the FDA. For ANDAs, applicants are not required to conduct complete clinical studies. Such applications, though, normally require bioavailability and/or bioequivalence studies conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”) and under the supervision of an IRB.
Like NDAs, ANDAs must be accompanied by user fees. For generic drugs, other fees, such as fees for drug master files, program fees and fees for manufacturing facilities, may also be required to be paid by the applicant, manufacturer, and/or drug master file holder.
Following submission of an ANDA, the FDA has 60 days to evaluate the application to determine if it is substantially complete. If the agency finds that the application is substantially complete, it will receive the application and begin its substantive review. As part of this substantive review, the FDA will determine whether or not the generic version submitted by the company meets the necessary approval standards, including bioequivalence to the reference listed drug, adequate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and manufacturing facilities and clinical study sites passing pre-approval inspections. Under the FDA’s Generic Drug User Fee Act performance goals, the FDA has the goal of reviewing and acting on 90% of standard original ANDAs within ten months of submission; however, certain factors can lengthen or shorten this review timeline.
Following its completion of the review of an ANDA, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing marketing for specific conditions, or a CRL. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either respond to the FDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA may also tentatively approve an ANDA application, as described above.
Upon approval, the FDA will rate generic drug products in the Orange Book. Products meeting bioequivalence standards will typically receive an AB rating. Under state law, such generic drug products may be able to be substituted at the pharmacy for the brand-name drug without the intervention of the prescribing physician, unless otherwise specified by the patient or physician. Many third-party payers of prescription drugs (e.g., health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid programs) have adopted policies to encourage the substitution of the lower-priced AB-rated generic drugs for the higher-priced branded drugs when an AB-rated generic drug is available as generic drugs are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs may provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers while maintaining the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use as the branded product.
Generally Applicable Requirements
Clinical trials for all product candidates must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial as well as review and approval of the study by an IRB. Before approving an application, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
Further, during development, the manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the U.S. is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
For both NDAs and ANDAs, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Regulatory Exclusivity, and Patent Term Extension
Orange Book Patent Listing
When an NDA is submitted to the FDA seeking approval of a drug, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, the applicant is required to list certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product or method of use with the FDA. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. In an effort to clarify which patents must be listed in the Orange Book, in January 2021, Congress passed the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2020, which largely codifies the FDA’s existing practices into the FDCA.
The Orange Book listed NDA products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV patent certification. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA approval cannot be made effective by FDA until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant makes a paragraph IV certification challenging an Orange Book-listed patent, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. If the NDA holder or patent owners of the listed drug asserts infringement of the patent in court within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from making the approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, the settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application approval also will not be made effective until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book has expired as described in further detail below.
Recently, Congress, the Administration and administrative agencies have introduced and/or taken certain measures to increase drug competition and thus, decrease drug prices, including with respect to drug importation, making reference product available to facilitate the development and testing of generic and 505(b)(2) products, and shared and individual REMS. New legislative and regulatory efforts could ultimately have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
The holder of an NDA may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot make the approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug effective. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), during which the FDA cannot accept any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for filing for the same active moiety except that the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
The holder of an NDA, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product or a new dosage form or route of administration, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from making the approval of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application effective for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has ended. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will also not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA.
In addition, an applicant submitting an ANDA to the FDA may be entitled to a 180-day market exclusivity period with respect to subsequently filed generic applications if such applicant is the first to submit a substantially complete application to the FDA and whose filing includes a paragraph IV certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed, obtains approval, and launches the product in the marketplace without triggering any statutory forfeiture provisions. An ANDA for a product designated as competitive generic therapy that does not otherwise have patent or exclusivity protections listed in the Orange Book and that is the first approved applicant, is also eligible for a period of 180 days of regulatory exclusivity with respect to other ANDAs. These ANDA exclusivity periods, however, can be lost under certain circumstances. Competitive generic therapies are products for which there is not more than one approved drug included in the Orange Book.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory and statutory exclusivity for NDA products, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above and patent protections. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data does not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the required time frames, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Moreover, pediatric exclusivity attaches to all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for products with existing marketing exclusivity or patent life that contain the same active moiety as that which was studied.
If approved, drug products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration if the approval is the first permitted commercial marketing for the product. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a marketing application, and all of the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. Whether any of our product candidates will be eligible for patent term restoration is currently unknown. Later, the applicable regulatory authorities may determine that we are not eligible for such restoration periods.
Depending on the drug product, other periods of regulatory exclusivity, such as orphan drug product exclusivity, may also block subsequent applicants.
Orphan Drug Designation
Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or affects more than 200,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. will be recovered from U.S. sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation provides certain benefits, such as the opportunity for grants, tax credits, application user fee waivers, and exemption from program user fees under certain circumstances. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. If approved for the orphan designation, orphan designated drugs may receive seven years of exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, protects the drug from FDA approval of another drug with the same principal molecular features for the same orphan indication. The FDA may, however, approve a product with the same principal molecular features for the same orphan indication during this time period if such product is able to demonstrate clinical superiority. The FDA may further approve a product with the same principal molecular features for a different indication, or a different product for the same indication during the orphan exclusivity period. Orphan exclusivity can also be lost under certain circumstances, such as the inability of the application holder to ensure sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drugs are also exempt from the above discussed PREA requirements. Orphan drugs are not, however, exempt from pediatric testing for molecularly targeted oncology drugs.
Combination Drug/Device Regulation
Our products and our products marketed by our partners, as well as our products being developed by our partners are most often categorized as “drug-device combination products” because they contain both a drug and a device to administer the drug. To date, our and our partners’ combination products have been regulated as drug, and are therefore subject to the NDA, ANDA, sNDA, sANDA and 505(b)(2) drug approval process and regulations. Combination drug/device products raise unique scientific, technical and regulatory issues. The FDA has established an Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products. The OCP assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug/delivery device combinations and assuring agreement within the FDA on review responsibilities. The device specific information is filed with the FDA as part of the drug approval submission or it may be filed separately in the form of a device master file, also known as the master access file (“MAF”). A MAF is not an FDA approval submission but is a filing that can be used to provide supporting data for our partners’ drug approval submissions. A MAF will be reviewed by the FDA only when referenced in an approval submission. By filing a MAF, we are able to provide information directly to the FDA, which can then be referenced by our partners in their drug approval submissions without having to share our proprietary information directly with our partners.
Where common data elements may be part of several submissions for regulatory approval, as in the case of information supporting an injection system, a MAF filing with the FDA may be the preferred route. A delivery device that is applicable to a variety of drug/device combination products, represents another opportunity for such a filing. Another option would be to obtain a 510(k) premarket clearance, de novo authorization, or premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA for our delivery device as a stand-alone product. The type of premarket submission required is based on the FDA device classification for the delivery device (Class I, II, III, or not yet classified). We intend to pursue such strategies as permitted by the law and as directed by the FDA either through guidance documents or discussions.
Development of a device with a specific drug will likely be handled as part of the marketing application for the drug product, which may be an NDA, ANDA, or supplemental application. Under these circumstances, the device component is only approved if the drug component is approved.
To the extent that our injectors are packaged with the drug as part of a drug delivery system, the entire package will be subject to the requirements for drug/device combination products. These include drug manufacturing requirements, drug adverse reaction and other reporting requirements, and all of the restrictions that apply to drug labeling and advertising. Additionally, such products will also be subject to certain device requirements, including QSRs and certain reporting requirements, such as medical device reports. Sponsors of clinical studies using investigational devices are also required to comply with the FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. These requirements necessitate additional expenditures of time and resources, which could have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our products and our operations.
Other Post-Approval Requirements and Promotional Activities
Any product manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, reporting, including adverse experience reporting, drug shortage reporting, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing, promotion, and post‑approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase IV clinical trials, REMS and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
There also are continuing annual user fee requirements. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register and, in the case of generic drug products, self-identify their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and list their drug products. Device manufacturers must also register their facilities and list the devices that they design, develop, manufacture or import, except those subject to a drug approval. These facilities must also pay annual registration fees. The distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples is also subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”).
FDA post-approval requirements are continually evolving. For example, in March 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) which includes various provisions regarding FDA drug shortage and manufacturing volume reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing. As part of the CARES Act implementation, the FDA recently issued guidance on the reporting of the volume of drugs produced, which reporting will require additional administrative efforts by drug manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, as well as liability under the civil False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts among other consequences.
Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Specifically, manufacturers and product sponsors may not promote a product for off-label uses and must also comply with the FDA’s other promotional requirements.
Manufacturing and Quality Regulations
The FDA established regulations to require that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs and medical devices conform to cGMPs and QSRs. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive, cover all aspects of manufacturing operations and require the conduct of investigations and FDA reporting under certain circumstances. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device design, quality and manufacturing, including, for example, pre-production design requirements and validation; production and process controls; complaint handling and investigations; corrective and preventative actions; and distribution, installation and servicing. Compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas. The FDA conducts periodic inspections of drug and device facilities to assess the cGMP/QSR status of marketed products. Before approval of an application, the FDA will typically also conduct facility inspections to ensure cGMP/QSR compliance.
Controlled Substances Regulation
Certain of our drug products are considered “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and implementing regulations, which, depending on the controlled substance schedule, establish certain registration, security, monitoring, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, inventory, quota, record keeping, prescribing, dispensing, and other requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I and II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our products.
The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Certain reports must also be made for controlled substances, such as reports for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance and reports of suspicious orders. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action. Individual states may also regulate controlled substances.
Foreign Approval Process
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we (and, where appropriate, our partners marketing medicinal products incorporating our devices) are subject to various foreign regulations governing clinical trials, manufacturing, and the commercial sales and distribution of our medicinal products. We and/or our partners must obtain approval of a medicinal product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement and the regulatory approval process all vary greatly from country to country. Additionally, the time it takes to complete the approval process in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Foreign regulatory approvals of our products are necessary whether or not we obtain FDA approval for such products. Finally, before a new drug may be exported from the U.S., it must either be approved for marketing in the U.S. or meet the requirements of exportation of an unapproved drug under Section 802 of the Export Reform and Enhancement Act or comply with FDA regulations pertaining to INDs.
In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures, principally the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which may provide a positive opinion regarding the application to the effect that it meets certain safety, quality and efficacy requirements. A centralized marketing authorization will be granted based on a positive opinion of the EMA as approved by the European Commission. It is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biologic products, and optional for certain other high technology products. The decentralized procedure allows companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU member states simultaneously for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state. The competent authority of one EU member state, selected by the applicant (the Reference Member State), assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other EU member states for which marketing authorizations are sought (concerned member states) are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require an authorization to be refused. This procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. The mutual recognition procedure applies in the case where a marketing authorization for the same medicinal product has already been granted by an EU/European Economic Area (“EEA”) member state, whereas the decentralized procedure is applicable if no marketing authorization exists. Since January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom has separate approval processes to the EU as a consequence of Brexit.
In so far as our products may be placed on the market as medical devices outside of the U.S. (as opposed to a delivery system of a medicinal product), we are also subject to foreign legal and regulatory requirements. Legal restrictions on the sale of imported medical devices and products vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. We primarily rely upon the companies’ marketing our injectors in foreign countries to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for sales of our products in those countries.
Our Minneapolis Quality Management System has ISO 13485: 2003 certification, the medical device industry standard for our quality systems. This certification shows that our device development and manufacturing comply with standards for quality assurance, design capability and manufacturing process control. Such certification, along with compliance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (which replaced the European Medical Device Directive 93/42/EC on May 27, 2020), enables us to affix the CE Mark (a certification indicating that a product has met EU consumer safety, health or environmental requirements) to current products and supply the device with a Declaration of Conformity. Regular surveillance audits by our notified body, British Standards Institute, are required to demonstrate continued compliance.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to numerous regulations by various federal, state and local authorities.
We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, reward or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs, except for activities protected by narrowly-drawn statutory and regulatory safe harbors. HHS recently promulgated a regulation that is effective in two phases. First, the regulation excludes from the definition of “remuneration” limited categories of (a) PBM rebates or other reductions in price to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or a Medicaid Managed Care Organization plan reflected in point-of sale reductions in price and (b) PBM service fees. Second, effective January 1, 2023, the regulation expressly provides that rebates to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D either directly to the plan sponsor under Medicare Part D, or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager will not be protected under the anti-kickback discount safe harbor. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it, and a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be grounds for a government or whistleblower claim under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Separately, the Beneficiary Inducement Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes similar restrictions on interactions between the biopharmaceutical industry and federal healthcare program beneficiaries.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds; knowingly making or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; conspiring to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government; or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Claims may be pursued by whistleblowers through qui tam actions, even if the government declines to intervene. Intent to deceive is not necessary to establish civil liability, which may be predicated on reckless disregard for or deliberate ignorance of the truth. The civil False Claims Act authorizes imposition of treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice, submitted for payment and may result in significant financial penalties and damages. The criminal federal False Claims Act imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false fictitious or fraudulent. Conviction or civil judgment for violation of the False Claims Act can also result in debarment from government procurement programs and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute further imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws also broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. The ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it.
Various federal and state healthcare programs obligate us to report drug pricing information that is used as the basis for their reimbursement rates for pharmacies and other healthcare providers including under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, prices charged certain federal agencies and non-federal purchasers, and required manufacturer rebates on prescriptions paid by Medicaid and other plans. Payment for a manufacturer’s drugs by these programs is conditioned on submission of this pricing information. States, such as California, have also enacted transparency laws that require manufacturers to report price increases and related information. Some government healthcare programs impose penalties if drug price increases exceed specified percentages or inflation rates, and these penalties can result in mandatory penny prices for certain federal and 340B program customers or rebates equal to 100% of average price. Failure to comply with the rules for calculating and submitting pricing information or otherwise overcharging the government or its beneficiaries may result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions, including False Claims Act liability.
In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act require extensive tracking of certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined under the Social Security Act), certain other types of healthcare professionals (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives licensed in the U.S.), and U.S. teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interest held by physicians and their immediate family members. Payments made to principal investigators and research institutions at teaching hospitals for clinical trials are also included within this law for reporting purposes. These payments and other transfers of value are required to be reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), which publishes the data publicly on the CMS Open Payments website. Government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices, and government entities may pursue enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. Similar state laws also impose reporting requirements for various types of payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers and organizations, including marketing and promotional expenses, and impose various types of gift bans and other compliance requirements on manufacturers. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements, gift bans and other compliance requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply to reimbursement for healthcare items and services regardless of the payer type, including private payers. A number of states now have implemented transparency laws requiring manufacturers to report pricing information and require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states restrict when and where pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing related activities. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to abide by the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Failure to comply with state laws could result in regulatory enforcement actions, including the assessment of significant administrative penalties.
Although we may not provide financial assistance to Medicare patients taking drugs sold by us, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) has established guidelines that permit pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations that provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent objective financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. If we, our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions.
The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires, as a condition of payment by certain federal agencies and the Medicaid program, that manufacturers of “covered drugs” enter into a Master Agreement, Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement, and Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory ceiling price to certain federal agencies, including the VA and Department of Defense. FSS contracts require compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including disclosure of commercial prices during contract negotiations and maintenance of price relationships during the term of the contract, and subject manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions. The Veterans Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price (derived from the Medicaid rebate percentage) to covered entities participating in the 340B drug discount program. Failure to provide the mandatory discount may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties, including when subsequent ceiling price recalculations due to pricing data submitted to CMS or new drug price estimations result in a covered entity having paid more that the revised ceiling price and the manufacturer has failed or refused to refund or credit a covered entity. Termination of either of these agreements under the Veterans Health Care Act also jeopardizes payment by Medicaid for the manufacturer’s drugs.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, expanded healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through establishment of state insurance exchanges and expansion of the Medicaid program. This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, payment of an annual fee by manufacturers of branded drugs and biological products based on their share of the federal market, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program, and fraud and abuse enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. The Affordable Care Act has since been amended to repeal the individual health insurance mandate, change price reporting rules for authorized generics, and increase manufacturers’ share of Medicare Part D prescription costs in the donut hole, and other provisions of the law may be repealed and replaced by Congress, which may greatly affect these government and third-party programs and their effect on our business.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. One such statute is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). HIPAA established uniform federal standards for “covered entities,” which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions, protecting the security and privacy of protected health information, and mandating security breach notification standards. In addition, other federal and state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, may govern the privacy and security of personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) further prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the U.S., can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, debarment prohibiting participation in government procurement and non-procurement covered transactions, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. In particular, in the EU the data privacy regime (the General Data Protection Regulation which came into effect on May 25, 2018) is regarded as stricter than the U.S. data protection laws. EU laws restrict the export of personal data outside the EU, for instance to the U.S., unless certain safeguards are in place. EU laws and industry codes also restrict certain marketing practices, including inappropriate inducements.
Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of the approved products in our portfolio depends, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers at the federal, state and private levels. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product portfolio will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product portfolio will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and/or similar healthcare management organizations, or are reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare coverage insurers and other third-party payers. The market for our product portfolio will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ formularies or lists of treatments for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement.
Also, third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. For example, for high-cost specialty drugs, third party payers have begun demanding value-based pricing in which price is linked to performance metrics. Recent state enactments establish significant negative incentives requiring negotiation of supplemental rebates, and a recent CMS regulation, implemented a most-favored nations pricing model seeking to lower prices under Medicare Part B by tying the costs of certain medicines to cheaper prices in other developed countries. This regulation was rescinded by a final rule published December 29, 2021; however, legislative and executive branch proposals also seek to establish this type of pricing for certain federal healthcare programs. Further, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. The cost of pharmaceuticals and medical devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience continued pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and administrative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payer policies as well as healthcare legislative and administrative reforms.
Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product portfolio and to operate profitably.
In international markets, there are health technology assessment regimes with price ceilings and supply and demand side restraints on specific products and therapies and profit controls in most EU member states as well as the United Kingdom. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that will likely affect our future operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve access, and improve quality. The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), passed in 2010, provided more Americans with healthcare coverage while attempting to curb the growth in healthcare spending in the U.S. The legislation included reforms to patient rights and protections, rules for insurance companies, taxes, tax breaks, funding and spending, and amended other laws including the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Since enactment of the ACA, some of its provisions have been repealed or amended, and other provisions may be repealed and replaced by Congress. Some of the main provisions of the ACA that affected the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry include, among others, the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and inclusion of Medicaid managed care plan utilization in manufacturers’ rebate obligations;
•new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance.
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label the drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements are also imposed on other trading partners in the supply chain.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Legislators and regulators at both the federal and state level are increasingly focused on containing the cost of drugs, and there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient support programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, California enacted a transparency law requiring manufacturers to report drug price increases and related information, including the reasons for the price increases. Congress also amended the Medicaid statute to alter price reporting of branded products sold as authorized generics, which effectively increases the rebates paid on the brand. Recent executive orders focusing on domestic sourcing also have required government agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, to limit procurement of essential medicines, including epinephrine, to products that are manufactured in the U.S. from U.S. API and other critical inputs. The list of essential medicines is established by the FDA and subject to change. These and any additional healthcare reform and procurement measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.
Other Regulatory Requirements and Considerations
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we must also comply with regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local regulations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. The effects of potential future changes in regulations or new legislation, if any, as a result of the new administration are also unknown.
