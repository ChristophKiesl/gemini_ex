Merger and Acquisition
 
The Company is actively seeking opportunity to merge and acquire potential target company to derive extraordinary synergies in multiple segments but limited to healthcare, bio-technology, beauty slimming and wellness, food science and related industries.

Marketing 
 
We recognize the growing trend of social media and because of that, the management had decided to place a higher priority on social media for our marketing strategy. Coupled with the extensive networks we had built since our inception, the nature of our job has become easier and efficient to reach out to our clients.
