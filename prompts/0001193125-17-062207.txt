2016 Acquisition Activity 
 We have historically pursued strategic acquisitions to leverage our existing capabilities and further build our business. Such activities continued during 2016. 
 On September 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Fairchild), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger with each of Fairchild and Falcon Operations Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which Fairchild became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Fairchild Transaction). The aggregate purchase price of the Fairchild Transaction was approximately $2,532.2 million and was funded by the borrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and a partial draw of our Revolving Credit Facility (as such terms are defined below under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations - Key Financing and Capital Events - Fairchild Transaction Financing) and with cash on hand. See Note 4: Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 We believe that the Fairchild Transaction creates a power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. Ultimately, we believe that the combination of Fairchild operations with our existing operations will provide complementary product lines to offer customers the full spectrum of high, medium and low voltage products. We will continue to pioneer technology and design innovation in efficient energy consumption to help our customers achieve success and drive value for our partners and employees around the world. We believe the acquisition of Fairchild also expands our footprint in wireless communication products, particularly in high efficiency power conversions and USB Type C communication and power delivery.

 Customers 
 In general, we have maintained long-term relationships with our key customers. Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require minimum purchase commitments. Most of our OEM customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year, while our other customers, including electronic manufacturer service providers and distributors, generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis. Our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end-markets, including computing, automotive, consumer, industrial, communications, networking, aerospace/defense and medical. For the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, we had no sales to individual customers, including distributors, that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, aggregate revenue from our five largest customers per segment, including distributors, for our Power Solutions Group, Analog Solutions Group, and Image Sensor Group, comprised approximately 40%, 31%, and 51%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue. The loss of certain of these customers or distributors may have a material adverse effect on the operations of the respective segment. 
 We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Subject to certain exceptions, our standard warranty extends for a period of two years. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days prior to shipment for custom products without incurring a significant penalty.

OEMs    Direct sales to OEMs accounted for approximately 38% of our revenues in 2016, 39% of our revenues in 2015 and 42% of our revenues in 2014. OEM customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as Bosch GmbH, Continental Automotive Systems, Delphi, Hella, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Magna International, Panasonic Corporation and Samsung Electronics. We focus on three types of OEMs: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and selected regional accounts, which are significant in specific markets, are our core OEM customers. The target market customers for our end-markets are OEMs that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development. Generally, our OEM customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty.
Distributors    Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 56% of our revenues in 2016, 54% of our revenues in 2015 and 50% of our revenues in 2014. Our distributors, which include Arrow, Avnet, Macnica, OS Electronics, World Peace and WT Microelectronics, resell to mid-sized and smaller OEMs and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies. Sales to certain distributors are made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. Under certain agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book. In addition, agreements with certain of our distributors contain stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Due to current limitations on the feasibility of estimating the upfront effect of returns and allowances with these distributors, we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to these distributors until these distributors resell the product. As a result, sales returns have minimal impact on our results of operations.
Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers    Direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 6% of our revenues in 2016, 7% of our revenues in 2015 and 8% of our revenues in 2014. Among our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are Benchmark Electronic, Flextronics, Jabil and Sanmina
. These customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for OEMs. Originally, these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards, but they now typically provide design, supply management and manufacturing solutions as well. Many OEMs now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies. We are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace. Generally, our electronic manufacturing service customers do not have the right to return our products following a sale other than pursuant to our standard warranty.
See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18: Segment Information in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for revenues by geographic locations.

(1)  These facilities are leased. 
 (2)  This facility is used for both front-end and back-end operations with a total square footage of 275,642. Consists of one leased and one owned building. 
 (3)  These facilities are located on leased land. 
 We operate all of our manufacturing facilities directly, with the exception of our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan. Our investment in Leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner, Leshan Radio Company Ltd., is formerly a state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder, provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We committed to purchase 80% of Leshans production capacity in each of 2016 and 2015, and 70% in 2014, and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshans expected production capacity in 2017. 
 
13 
 
We use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers, including Amkor, ASE, Kingpak, SMIC, TPSCo and UMC, collectively accounted for approximately 36%, 39% and 30% of our manufacturing costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 Raw Materials 
 Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources, generally on a just-in-time basis, and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our contractual obligations table in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Contractual Obligations included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply, increased demand in the industry or other factors. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 As of December 31, 2016, our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 1,700 professionals, servicing customers globally. We support our customers through logistics organizations and just-in-time warehouses. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective global applications support from our Technical Information Centers and Solution Engineering Centers, allowing for applications which are developed in one region of the world to be instantaneously available throughout all other regions. 
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 We market our products primarily under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor® and our ON logo, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our intellectual property. We acquired or were licensed or sublicensed to a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. As of December 31, 2016, we held patents with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2038, and none of the patents that expire in the next three years materially affect our business. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. 
Seasonality 
 Historically, our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end-markets, which typically results in a stronger second half of the year for certain end-markets as compared to the first half of the year. With our recent acquisitions and our continued focus on the 
 
14 
 
 automotive end market, we have started to experience a stronger first half of the year, which partially offsets the seasonality experienced during the prior years. However, in the future, we could experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions or for other reasons. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 Backlog and Inventory 
 Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to orders that are predominantly booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our Electronic Data Interface customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. For those shipments to distributors who are allowed sales return rights and allowances, we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenue depending on if the sale originated through an ON Semiconductor or legacy Fairchild system or process. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies for additional information. Thus, backlog comprised of orders from these distributors will not result in revenues until these distributors sell the products ordered. During 2016, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 82% and 87% of actual revenues during such quarter, which is consistent with backlog levels in recent prior periods. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase. 
 In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results. 
 We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations. We routinely generate inventory based on customers estimates of end-user demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. See Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business located elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the inventory practices within the semiconductor industry. 
 Competition 
 The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. We face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because some of our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, can be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 In comparison, several competitors noted below are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution

 of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments: 
 Power Solutions Group 
 The Power Solutions Group is a leading provider of power semiconductors to the automotive, industrial, wireless and mass markets. Our competitive strengths include our core competencies of leading edge fabrication technologies, micro packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high quality cost effective manufacturing, and supply chain management which ensures supply to our customers.

 The principal methods of competition in the Analog Solutions Group are based on design experience, manufacturing capability, depth and quality of IP, ability to service customer needs from the design phase to the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle, longevity of technology support and experience of sales and technical support personnel. Our competitive position is also enhanced by long-standing relationships we have established with leading OEM customers. 
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on internal and external variables, both inside and outside of our control. These variables include, but are not limited to, the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and availability of supply, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. Select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include: Infineon Technologies AG; Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Renesas Electronics Corporation; STMicroelectronics N.V.; and Texas Instruments Inc. 
 Image Sensor Group 
 The principal method of competition in the Image Sensor Group is based on imaging experience for end users. Our competitive strengths include differentiating ourselves from others by leveraging our deep technical knowledge and close customer relationships to drive the most compelling imaging experience for end users. The Image Sensor Group was the first to commercialize CMOS active pixel sensors and the first to introduce CMOS technology into many of our markets, leveraging four decades of CCD imaging experience into market leading positions in automotive and industrial applications, bringing a wealth of technical and end-user applications knowledge to help customers develop innovative imaging solutions across a broad range of end-user needs. Select competitors for certain of our products and solutions include: Omnivision Technologies; Samsung 
 
16 
 
 Semiconductor; Sony Semiconductor; STMicroelectronics N.V.; and Toshiba Corporation for image sensors, as well as Dongwoon Anatech Co., Ltd.; Renesas Electronics Corporation; and Rohm Semiconductor for actuator drivers. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $452.3 million, $396.7 million and $366.6 million, representing 12%, 11%, and 12% of revenue, respectively. We seek to maximize the investment of our people and capital in research and development by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that position the company to outperform the industry. Our design expertise in analog, digital, mixed signal and imaging ICs, combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive, value added solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems. 
Government Regulation 
 Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites, and the investigation and remediation of contamination. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines. 
 Our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a Superfund site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Motorola and now Freescale have been actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our separation from Motorola in 1999, Motorola retained responsibility for this contamination, and Motorola and Freescale (which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NXP Semiconductors N.V. on December 7, 2015) have agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter. 
 Our former front-end wafer manufacturing location in Aizu, Japan is located on property where soil and ground water contamination has been detected. We believe that the contamination originally occurred during a time when the facility was operated by a prior owner. We have been working with local authorities to implement remediation actions and expect all remaining remediation costs to be covered by insurance. Based on information available, any net costs to us in connection with this matter are not expected to be material. 
 Our manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic has ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that this facility was operated by government-owned entities. The remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site, with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded. The government of the Czech Republic has agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material. 
 Our design center in East Greenwich, Rhode Island is located on property that has localized soil contamination. When we purchased the East Greenwich facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly 
 
17 
 
 groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material. 
 As a result of the acquisition of AMIS in 2008, we are a primary responsible party to an environmental remediation and cleanup at AMISs former corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Costs incurred by AMIS include implementation of the clean-up plan, operations and maintenance of remediation systems and other project management costs. However, AMISs former parent company, a subsidiary of Nippon Mining, contractually agreed to indemnify AMIS and us for any obligations relating to environmental remediation and clean-up at this location. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any future costs to us in connection with this matter will be material. 
 Through the acquisition of Fairchild, we acquired facilities in South Portland, Maine and West Jordan, Utah, which have ongoing environmental remediation projects to respond to certain releases of hazardous substances that occurred prior to the leveraged recapitalization of Fairchild from its former parent company, National Semiconductor Corporation, which is now owned by Texas Instruments, Inc. Although we may incur certain liabilities with respect to the above remediation projects, pursuant to the asset purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Fairchild recapitalization, National Semiconductor Corporation agreed to indemnify Fairchild, without limitation and for an indefinite period of time, for all future costs related to these projects. Additionally, under the 1999 asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Fairchild purchased the power device business of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), Samsung agreed to indemnify Fairchild in an amount up to $150.0 million for remediation costs and other liabilities related to historical contamination at Samsungs Bucheon, South Korea operations. The costs incurred to respond to the above conditions and projects have not been, and are not expected to be, material, and any future payments we make in connection with such liabilities are not expected to be material. 
 We were notified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under CERCLA in the Chemetco Superfund matter. Chemetco is a defunct reclamation services supplier who operated in Illinois at what is now a Superfund site. We used Chemetco for reclamation services. The EPA is pursuing Chemetco customers for contribution to the site cleanup activities. We have joined a PRP group which is cooperating with the EPA in the evaluation and funding of the cleanup. Based on the information available, any costs to us in connection with this matter have not been, and are not expected to be, material. 
 We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were not material, and we do not expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company or its subsidiaries. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 32,000 employees worldwide, of which approximately 4,400 employees were in the United States. The primary reason for the increase in headcount from prior year was due 
 
18 
 
 to the addition of Fairchild employees. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements, except for our employees at the Mountain Top, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (e.g., those in China, Korea, Japan and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. For information regarding employee risk associated with our international operations, see Risk Factors - Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Of the total number of our employees as of December 31, 2016, approximately 26,500 were engaged in manufacturing, approximately 1,700 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization, which includes customer service, approximately 1,100 were engaged in administration and approximately 2,700 were engaged in research and development.
