Overview 
 We are a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of transformative and innovative infectious disease test kits. We have developed a testing platform that produces centralized-laboratory-accurate molecular testing in a single-use and consumer-friendly test kit that is powered by two AA batteries and fits in the palm of a hand. We designed our test kits to provide accurate, reliable and on-the-spot molecular test results anywhere and at any time. We believe the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic has shown the infectious disease testing infrastructure in the United States was not designed to accommodate the immediate demands of infectious disease control on a mass-population scale. The testing options today are too expensive, inaccurate, or are inaccessible due to slow time to results or complexity. Mass-population infectious disease testing requires a testing platform that can provide accurate and clinically relevant results on-the-spot, be affordably mass produced, portable and easy-to-use anywhere. Our LUCIRA COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit used in the point-of-care, or POC, and prescription at-home settings and pending OTC EUA authorization, if received, for the LUCIRA CHECK IT COVID-19 Test Kit used in the over-the-counter, or OTC, setting, utilize identical components and are referred to as test kit or COVID-19 test kit.  Our test kit is designed to provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes from sample collection. We believe, at scale, it will be an affordable, mass-population testing solution. Our initial focus is within respiratory diseases, starting with COVID-19 and influenza A and B virus indications. 
 Our first clinical trial was conducted among symptomatic individuals and demonstrated the molecular accuracy of our COVID-19 test kit as comparable to the known high sensitivity Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay, or Hologic Panther Fusion, was initiated in September 2020 and supported our first Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA. The Hologic Panther Fusion is a high sensitivity molecular assay due to its low Limit of Detection, or LoD as labeled in its U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, EUA. In this clinical trial, we collected samples from 101 subjects, tested the samples head-to-head against the Hologic Panther Fusion and achieved 94.1% positive percent agreement (96.0% with discrepant testing) and 98.0% negative percent agreement. Our strong clinical performance was enabled by our LoD of 900 copies per mL of viral transfer media equivalent, or cps / mL VTM equivalent, which allows our COVID-19 test kit to detect viral genetic material in orders of magnitude better than antigen tests. In addition, our COVID-19 test kit is easy-to-use. Specifically, 100% of patients successfully performed self-testing at home using our COVID-19 test kit in less than two minutes in a human usability study we conducted with 398 users at research facilities in Sunnyvale and Fresno, California. The measure for successful performance was the ability to collect a nasal specimen and start the test running on the first try, either without having to look back at the directions or with only one look back. On November 17, 2020, we received an EUA, from the FDA for (1) prescription at-home use with self-collected nasal swab specimens in individuals aged 14 and older who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and (2) use at the POC, with self-collected nasal swab specimens in individuals aged 14 and older, and in individuals aged 13 and under when the specimen is collected by a healthcare provider at the POC. Our test kit was the first FDA-authorized, under an EUA, COVID-19 test that allows patients to test themselves and receive results at home.  Our prescription at-home use indication does not require healthcare provider telehealth or video observation.
 In December 2020, we initiated a follow-on clinical trial among asymptomatic individuals to support both a new EUA submission for OTC non-prescription use, as well as an EUA amendment to our initial EUA to expand the indicated population to include asymptomatic individuals.  We refer to our clinical trial among symptomatic individuals and our follow-up clinical trial among asymptomatic individuals as our Community Testing Studies.  The asymptomatic study enrolled a total of 303 individuals, including 81 asymptomatic positives, and again utilized the Hologic Panther Fusion as the comparator. Results of the follow-on asymptomatic study showed no statistical difference in our test performance compared to the first study among symptomatic individuals. Hence, simply increasing the sample and confidence in our molecular accuracy as compared to the known high sensitivity Hologic Panther Fusion assay.  Our accuracy across both Community Testing Studies as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion was 96% across all 404 samples. Our sensitivity, or positive percent agreement (PPA), was 92% across all 132 positive samples.  Excluding samples with very low levels of virus that possibly were no longer 
 1


infectious, our sensitivity, or PPA was 97%. Our specificity, or negative percent agreement (NPA) across both studies was 98%.
 We submitted EUA applications to the FDA for the expansion of our current EUA to include asymptomatic individuals and OTC use in February 2021.  Both of these submissions are pending authorization as of the date of this filing.  If we receive these additional EUAs, our indicated population will expand to include individuals with and without symptoms, as well as in the prescription at-home and OTC non-prescription indication to include children aged two to 13 with adult collected samples. If we receive an additional EUA for OTC, our COVID-19 test kit product will be one of the first single-use molecular tests that provides polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, quality molecular accuracy pending FDA authorization. Further, pending EUA authorization, to facilitate public health reporting for OTC users, we have developed a text based secure web portal to provide verified test results back to a user’s phone, as well as transmit results to relevant public health authorities.  We believe our portal is easy to use and it can be accessed without downloading an app.    
 We plan to develop a combination COVID-19 and influenza A and B viruses test kit for prescription at-home use and later a separate influenza A and B viruses test kit, or our influenza test kit, for OTC use. 
 Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, like viruses and bacteria, that enter the body. These diseases can spread from either person-to-person through direct or indirect contact, such as airborne particles from coughing or sneezing, or through a vector such as an animal or insect. Outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases, that spread from person-to-person, require immediate, mass-population testing in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. As of March 20, 2021, more than 122 million cases have been reported worldwide with more than 2.7 million deaths. The world economy has been significantly impacted and the World Bank noted that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to plunge most countries into recession in 2021 with per capita income contracting in the largest fraction of countries globally since 1870 with advanced economies projected to shrink approximately 7%. COVID-19 diagnostic testing volume in the United States grew rapidly to approximately 250 million tests in 2020.  First quarter 2021 testing volume is estimated at approximately 150 million tests. As of the date hereof, the world continues to struggle with monitoring and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 molecular testing accounts for approximately one-third of all COVID-19 tests conducted, which translates into a current market spend of approximately $6.0 billion for molecular COVID-19 testing. 
 From December 2020 through February 2021, the FDA issued EUAs for three COVID-19 vaccines; however, we believe the need for ongoing detection and monitoring will continue given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We also believe COVID-19, like influenza, will remain endemic for the foreseeable future and people suspected of influenza-like illness, or ILI, may want to purchase a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit to confirm their diagnosis in order to receive timely and appropriate treatment and quarantine themselves if and as needed. We believe that to successfully combat infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza, vaccines, therapeutics, testing, and public health measures such as mask wearing and social distancing all need to be deployed. We believe there will especially be an increased need for COVID-19 negative verification testing as we start to experience COVID-19 as an endemic disease and begin to spend both more time in public spaces with large numbers of people such as sporting events, large employers and traveling; as well as seeking to spend more time gathered with family and friends who may be older or health compromised.  We believe our test kit is well suited to play a role in reopening and the mitigation of COVID-19 spread. 
 Influenza, commonly known as “the flu,” is an infectious respiratory disease caused by several influenza viruses. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that influenza has been responsible for between approximately 12,000 and 61,000 deaths in the United States annually since 2010. In the United States, seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over $11.0 billion, with direct medical costs estimated to be over $3.0 billion annually. According to industry estimates, a future influenza pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. Approximately 174 million influenza vaccine doses were distributed in the United States in the 2019-2020 influenza season, and for the 2020-2021 season, vaccine manufacturer projections range from approximately 194 million to 198 million doses. We believe this rising demand for influenza vaccines, coupled with the inability to definitively determine based on symptoms alone whether a person has COVID-19 or influenza or another viral infection, translates to greater interest 
 2


in products to diagnose and treat ILI. We estimate that the total potential market spend for OTC influenza testing could be in excess of $800 million based on current testing volumes, and the total addressable market could be up to approximately $4.0 billion based on an estimate that approximately 200 million people per year purchase treatments for the symptoms of ILI, according to Nielsen Corporation figures from October 2019, and an estimated OTC retail price of approximately $20 per test kit, assuming that all people who purchase treatments for the symptoms of ILI would purchase an OTC influenza test. 
 Traditional infectious disease testing options have been limited in their accessibility and effectiveness largely due to their spoke and wheel framework whereby sample specimens are collected away from the lab testing hub.  This framework creates complex and expensive sample transport logistics, and ultimately, limited clinical relevance during infectious disease outbreaks due to slower, multi-day time to results. There are several different testing modalities or techniques that are employed to determine the presence of a target disease or a proxy of the target disease. Each modality provides different clinically useful information due to its inherent differences and testing limits. The large categories of infectious disease tests generally fall into one of three categories: molecular tests, antigen tests and antibody tests. Molecular tests have the lowest LoD of the testing modalities and therefore can identify contagious people earlier. Having a lower LoD is better because it allows the test to detect the presence of lower amounts of viral genetic material. We believe the current molecular testing infrastructure in the United States does not meet the immediate demands of infectious disease management on a mass-population scale as it relies on centralized testing that involves complex sample transportation, logistics, and throughput bottlenecks. These tests have traditionally required complex instrumentation to accomplish the chemical amplification and detection needed. The majority of these molecular tests occur within centralized laboratory settings where it can take from two to 14 days to return a result, which does not include the sample acquisition and delivery times. Further, many of these tests require highly trained and specialized technicians to operate the laboratory equipment. More recently, some benchtop instruments have been developed in the POC setting with the capability to perform these complex and sensitive molecular tests, but these tests still require a trained operator, an electrical outlet and a separate dedicated instrument which limits their portability. These POC instruments typically have limited throughput, capable of processing only a single sample at a time. 
 Antigen tests have emerged as a category of stopgap tests that address the needs for portability and affordability, but they do not generally provide a balanced level of accuracy across identifying both positives and negatives. They have a more limited ability to detect active infection across the full spectrum of illness, including at and before symptom onset. Therefore, they tend to be of limited use to people until several days after symptom onset and often require a follow-on confirmatory molecular test. Antigen tests often miss early positives due to this lack of sensitivity which is insufficient for reliable infectious disease monitoring. Antibody tests have limited clinical relevance because they do not test for active infection and therefore do not indicate whether a person is actively contagious. We designed our test kits to mitigate the shortcomings of both molecular lab-based and antigen testing. 
 We believe providing an easy-to-use COVID-19 test kit with PCR-quality molecular accuracy that allows people both with and without symptoms to test themselves anywhere, especially in the safety of their own homes, is one of the best ways to help mitigate the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Decentralized use of these consumer-friendly test kits can transform the way society mitigates the spread by testing infectious people anywhere, especially at home, and avoiding exposure to others in the community. However, outbreaks of highly contagious diseases, like COVID-19, require immediate, mass-population testing which traditional testing infrastructure within the United States is not historically designed to support. With our platform, we are reimagining current infectious disease testing through innovative test kits that deliver on-the-spot testing with molecular accuracy in a portable, affordable and easy-to-use format. Our platform is designed to produce assays that combine the accuracy and reliability of molecular tests and the accessibility and ease of use of antigen tests to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our molecular test kits are designed to be diagnostically definitive, unlike the antigen tests on the market today. Importantly, our test also provides a platform for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals to easily check their COVID-19 infection status in 30 minutes or less, thus providing a practical testing solution that can be utilized at high scale as we begin navigating a new normal living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.
 We designed our proprietary platform from the ground up to be able to provide accurate, consumer-friendly, affordable and convenient infectious disease test kits, and our COVID-19 test kit can provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes. Our platform has four key attributes: (1) robust target identification, (2) colorimetric assay, (3) consumer-friendly test kit and (4) flexible assay architecture. We use our expertise in 
 3


infectious disease, virology and bioinformatics in support of our target identification efforts. Our colorimetric assay design provides for accurate and cost-effective viral detection. Our consumer-friendly “swab, stir, detect” sequence eliminates complicated workflow steps such that 100% of patients successfully performed self-testing at home using our COVID-19 test kit in less than two minutes in a human usability study we conducted with 398 users at research facilities in Sunnyvale and Fresno, California. The measure for successful performance was the ability to collect a nasal specimen and start the test running on the first try, either without having to look back at the directions or with only one look back. Furthermore, our platform is designed with a flexible assay architecture in which we can largely leverage all these components to accelerate the development of new test kits for additional indications, including other infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, and respiratory syncytial virus, to market with minimal changes. 
 Our proprietary platform enabled us to refocus our near-term business strategy to develop our COVID-19 test kit, pictured below with its box and instructions for use. 
 

Our COVID-19 test kit is designed to provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes from sample collection, and we believe, at scale, it will be an affordable, mass-population testing solution. We believe our platform provides the following competitive benefits: 
  
• | Molecular accuracy. Accurate testing, which we measure using LoD, is paramount in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. LoD is the defining measure of an assay’s ability to reliably detect the presence of a specific target, such as viral RNA or protein. Tests with a lower LoD are more sensitive because they can detect positive samples with low viral load. All the FDA EUA authorized high sensitivity molecular assays have an LoD of 1,000 cps / mL VTM equivalent or lower, which is significantly better than antigen tests. These molecular tests can be used reliably among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, unlike antigen tests which can be limited to use among symptomatic individuals in their first seven days of symptoms. Molecular tests are diagnostically definitive, whereas antigen tests are not. We perform routine surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains by periodically evaluating in silico reactivity against sequence databases. While our evaluations of the variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and

Southern California have shown that these four variants are reactive to our COVID-19 test kit, we cannot currently definitively confirm that our COVID-19 test kit will be successful in detecting these strains. We anticipate performing testing to confirm detection with these strains once they become commercially available.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple, intuitive test kit. We designed our test kits to be used anywhere and at any time. Our test kits have a simple, intuitive, three-step “swab, stir, detect” sequence. In our usability studies, approximately 97% of users said our COVID-19 test kit met or exceeded their expectations with regard to ease of use, whereas many molecular tests require specialized equipment and trained personnel for operation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Portable ‘swab-to-result’ within 30 minutes. Our COVID-19 test kit was designed to provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes, with the potential for a positive COVID-19 result in as few as 11 minutes. We believe this is highly beneficial when dealing with infectious diseases as it allows people to quickly determine if they are infected and enables them to appropriately quarantine, mitigate the spread and reduce infection rates. Molecular tests completed in centralized laboratories can take days or weeks to report results, at which point the tests are less clinically relevant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Affordable. Rapidly deploying millions of tests per month requires the tests to be relatively inexpensive. We have purpose-built and designed our test kits to not have additional instrument costs and be a single, portable unit that can be manufactured and affordable at scale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible with potential for broad applicability. We built our platform to be flexible and applicable to additional assays using the same core test kit. As an example of our platform’s agility and robustness, we leveraged over half a decade of research and development of our test kit and expertise in target identification and assay development for influenza into a test kit for COVID-19. We intend to pursue additional indications in the future, including other infectious diseases such as STIs and respiratory syncytial virus, and believe this component of our strategy and business model will be a core value driver for us over the long term.

 Our proprietary platform enables us to develop a pipeline of infectious disease test kits. Our current focus is on our COVID-19 test kit. The following chart outlines our test kit portfolio, categorized by the prescription or OTC commercialization channel and the anticipated year of FDA submission, based on our current estimates and belief. The footnotes in the chart below describe our anticipated regulatory approval pathway.

Timeline represents anticipated FDA submission dates. The pathway to obtain an EUA for influenza or combination COVID-19 and influenza test kits remains uncertain. We may not pursue an amended or additional EUA, and we may need to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a de-novo application from the FDA for our COVID-19, influenza, and combination COVID-19 and influenza test kits. Furthermore, the FDA may require us to initiate one or more additional clinical trials. The estimated timing or scope of any such future clinical trials is not definitively ascertainable. 
  
(1) | Represents our COVID-19 test kit. We received an EUA from the FDA on November 17, 2020, for prescription at-home and POC use in people who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider (people who are symptomatic or are thought to have been exposed to COVID-19).

We submitted an EUA application in February 2021 expanding our indication from prescription at-home and POC use in people who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider (individuals who are symptomatic or are thought to have been exposed to COVID-19) to also include asymptomatic individuals. Our EUA authorization is pending as of the date of this filing and we cannot be certain that it will be received.

We anticipate submitting a new EUA application with the FDA or seeking 510(k) clearance or approval of a de-novo application for prescription at-home use of our combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit, once developed. As of March 2021, we have not submitted an application to the FDA.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Represents our influenza test kit. We anticipate seeking 510(k) clearance or approval of a de-novo application for OTC use of our influenza test kit. As of March 2021, we have not submitted an application to the FDA pursuant to our anticipated regulatory approval pathway.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to commercialize our COVID-19 test kit within POC and prescription at-home settings through partnerships with customers, such as hospital networks, payors, corporate senior living facilities and large employers. We completed an additional clinical trial to expand our indication from people who are suspected of COVID-19 to include asymptomatic people and submitted an application in February 2021 for an expanded EUA for this indication as well as a new EUA application for OTC use of our COVID-19 test kit.  We plan to invest in clinical activities to develop a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit for prescription at-home as well as an influenza test kit for OTC. We have commenced manufacturing activities to support our planned 2021 commercial launch of our COVID-19 test kit, and our goal is to achieve increased manufacturing output by the second half of 2021. 
 What Sets Us Apart 
 Our goal is to reimagine infectious disease testing by enabling accurate, on-the-spot molecular testing with a consumer-friendly test kit that can be used anywhere and at any time. Our proprietary, single-use COVID-19 test kit has been designed to provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 test result within 30 minutes with a comparable LoD to highly accurate molecular PCR assays run in centralized laboratories. Our simple and intuitive test kit is powered by two AA batteries, fits in the palm of a hand and can be reliably used by individuals with and without symptoms. We believe the following competitive advantages set us apart: 

• | First mover advantage for an innovative, single-use, consumer-friendly molecular testing platform designed to provide clinically relevant COVID-19 results for individuals both with and without symptoms within 30 minutes anywhere.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular accuracy. In our head-to-head Community Testing Studies, our COVID-19 test kit performed comparably to the Hologic Panther Fusion, one of the current market-leading high-sensitivity PCR assays performed in centralized laboratories given its low LoD. This technical achievement was possible due to our platform which uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification, or LAMP, combined with our proprietary colorimetric detection technology to yield an LoD of 900 cps /mL VTM. Importantly, our test’s ability to detect both active infection and rule out the absence of infection differentiates it compared to rapid antigen tests. Specifically, our COVID-19 test kit’s LoD is significantly more sensitive than the LoDs of antigen tests, thus significantly reducing the potential for false negatives compared to antigen tests. In a December 2020 Journal of Clinical Microbiology publication evaluating the analytical sensitivity of an antigen test indicated for prescription at-home use, the positive percent agreement of the antigen test as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion was 83%. We believe that, if used on the subjects tested in the aforementioned study, our COVID-19 test kit would have achieved a 98% positive percent agreement as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion, which is 15 percentage points higher than the evaluated antigen test, assuming that

our COVID-19 test kit would have performed consistently with the results of our Community Testing Studies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single-use, intuitive design. We designed our test kits to be single-use and intuitive with a simple three-step “swab, stir, detect” sequence. Our test kit comes with simple instructions and all required components, including two AA batteries, and fits in the palm of a hand. The results are displayed clearly in a light-up display. The single-use design eliminates the need to purchase and maintain a separate instrument or reader, unlike other molecular tests, and eliminates the need for testing slowdown for reuse. 100% of patients successfully performed self-testing at home using our COVID-19 test kit in less than two minutes in a human usability study we conducted with 398 users at research facilities in Sunnyvale and Fresno, California. The measure for successful performance was the ability to collect a nasal specimen and start the test running on the first try, either without having to look back at the directions or with only one look back.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ‘Swab-to-result’ within 30 minutes. Along with molecular accuracy, we designed our COVID-19 test kit to provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes, with the potential for a positive COVID-19 result in as few as 11 minutes. Providing an on-the-spot test result is important in infectious disease testing because it allows for positive results to be delivered quickly and for a person to quarantine earlier, thereby mitigating the spread. We believe our ability to deliver on-the-spot test results sets us apart from centralized laboratory molecular tests that can take days or even weeks to deliver a result.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Affordable. We believe at initial OTC launch, if we receive EUA authorization, we will be at a better price point than the at-home nasal self-collection kits being sold by labs. These mail-in self collection kits require users to mail back their nasal swab samples for lab testing, with result reporting taking up to several days. We expect our OTC price, if authorized, to be nearly equivalent to our current POC test pricing. While our POC pricing is presently at a premium to other POC tests, we believe there will be segments within POC—such as pre-procedural testing and urgent care triage—where the portability of our test kit will differentiate us from our competitors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust platform with flexible hardware and multiplexed target identification capabilities designed to allow development of and testing for multiple assays. We designed our test kits with the capacity for multiplexing, meaning that multiple assays can be easily tested on a single test kit. Our flexible platform allows us to target a potentially wide range of infectious diseases through disease-specific assay-containing pellets contained within independent reaction chambers. As an example of our platform’s agility and robustness, we leveraged over half a decade of research and development in our test kit and expertise in target identification and assay development for influenza into a test kit for COVID-19. We believe our platform has the potential to be applied to additional infectious diseases in the future.

• | Rigorous product development processes and scalable infrastructure. We have developed significant internal capabilities notably around research and development, product design, and supply chain management. All of our core technology, such as the multiplexed biological assay device and the colorimetric detection method, were developed in-house by our experienced research and development team. We have also partnered with a U.S.-based, global manufacturing services company in order to have access to immediate and scalable manufacturing. We believe the design of our platform, and the supply chain we have built to capture low-cost economies of scale, are an advantage for us.

As of December 31, 2020, we owned four issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. utility patent applications, two issued foreign patents and 34 pending foreign patent applications. Three currently issued filings and associated technology enable our highly accurate platform. We have protected our intellectual property rights through our patent portfolio and have maintained and executed on deliberate innovation areas to sustain the continued growth of our patent portfolio. Furthermore, we own trade secrets and research and development know-how supporting our ability to create the assays used in our platform.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 We intend to build a transformational infectious disease testing company delivering on a broad test menu for infectious diseases over time. To achieve our growth plan, we plan to employ several core strategies: 

• | Commercialize our COVID-19 test kit through a staged regulatory approval approach first in POC and prescription at-home use and then expanding to OTC, pending EUA authorization. Initially, we pursued POC and prescription at-home EUA authorizations for our COVID-19 test kit. We received an EUA from the FDA on November 17, 2020 for these indications for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples from people suspected of COVID-19. In February 2021, we submitted EUA applications to the FDA to expand our initial prescription indication to include individuals both with and without symptoms and for OTC use. Our expanded POC and prescription at-home and OTC use EUAs are pending as of the date of this filing and we cannot be certain we will receive them.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and automate production capabilities to better address market demand while capturing economies of scale. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for COVID-19 testing has increased significantly across all stakeholder groups. COVID-19 diagnostic testing volume in the United States grew rapidly to approximately 250 million tests in 2020. First quarter 2021 testing volume is estimated at approximately 150 million tests. Similar to influenza, we believe there will be a continued need for COVID-19 testing even after an effective vaccine has been widely distributed and compliantly administered. To better meet the significant market demand, a key part of our growth strategy includes expanding our current production capacity and automating our manufacturing process. Our test kits have been designed for automated production. Eventually, we could expand manufacturing to additional locations around the world to further our manufacturing capacity and reach. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop and launch additional test kits in the prescription at-home channel, beginning with a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit as well as OTC test kits for influenza. Our flexible platform enables us to quickly develop and deploy assays for other infectious diseases as well as multiplex for combination tests. Capitalizing on the flexibility of our platform is a key pillar to our strategy and will enable us to focus on other large markets, including influenza A and B viruses. The influenza assay has been clinically tested and showed sensitivity and specificity comparable to other FDA-authorized influenza assays, and we believe with additional work could be combined with our current COVID-19 assay into a multiplex assay. We plan to conduct new clinical trials in the 2021-2022 influenza season and anticipate the FDA submission of this combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit to be in 2022. We believe this combination test kit would be the preferred assay for prescription at-home use. We additionally will work with the FDA to obtain regulatory approval for our influenza test kit to be sold OTC subsequently.

Building on our usability studies and EUA indications, we plan to leverage our clinical work to publish key research and articles to increase awareness and build credibility for our technology platform among healthcare providers and KOLs. Further, pending EUA OTC authorization, we are planning to conduct a consumer marketing campaign with advertisements to raise broad awareness of our test kit.

Infectious Diseases Overview 
 Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, like viruses and bacteria, and can be spread from person-to-person or through a vector such as an animal or insect. One method of person-to-person spread is direct contact, in which the virus or bacteria is directly transferred from one person to another through touch, coughing or sneezing. Indirect contact is another method of transmission and occurs when an infected person touches an inanimate object, leaves behind pathogens, and another person touches the object and picks up the pathogens that were left behind. Airborne transmission occurs when pathogens from an infected person are expelled into the air, remain suspended and then infect another person. COVID-19 and influenza are infectious respiratory diseases that are caused by viruses and are transmitted from person-to-person. 
 COVID-19 
 COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. As of March 20, 2021, more than 122 million cases have been reported worldwide with more than 2.7 million deaths. The CDC’s current and non-exhaustive list of symptoms includes fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea. While most people have mild symptoms, some people face more serious consequences, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, blood clots and death. The typical incubation period can range from two to 14 days. 
 This virus is spread primarily via small droplets from coughing, sneezing and talking. It is believed that the point at which people are most contagious is early in the course of their illness, particularly when they are beginning to experience symptoms. According to the CDC, a patient is potentially contagious until 10 days following symptom onset, resolution of fever for at least 24 hours and improvement of other symptoms, although viral spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who are asymptomatic. In April 2020, the World Health Organization reported that according to preliminary data people might be more contagious within the first three days from the onset of symptoms. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular lungs and heart) has also been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, breathlessness and other symptoms for months afterwards. 
 The World Bank noted that the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to plunge most countries into recession in 2021 with per capita income contracting in the largest fraction of countries globally since 1870 with advanced economies projected to shrink approximately 7%. We believe COVID-19 will be endemic.  The recent string of events has highlighted the necessity for decentralized widespread accurate diagnostic testing to mitigate the health and economic turmoil resulting from the spread of the disease. 
 Influenza Virus A and B 
 Influenza, commonly known as “the flu,” is an infectious respiratory disease caused by an influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe (including death) and commonly include high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week. The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks. Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. There are currently four known types of influenza viruses. Two of these are the most common among human infections; influenza A and B viruses. Seasonal influenza is caused by influenza A and B viruses, while pandemic influenza occurs when a novel influenza strain appears. Usually, the virus is spread through the air from coughing or sneezing. A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms. 
 Influenza-related costs include direct costs such as lost productivity and associated medical treatment, as well as indirect costs of preventive measures. The CDC estimates that influenza has been responsible for between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths in the United States annually since 2010. In the United States, seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over $11.0 billion, with direct medical costs estimated 
 9


to be over $3.0 billion annually. According to industry estimates, a future influenza pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs. We believe current testing infrastructure is equally ill-equipped to support the testing needs of a future influenza pandemic. 
 Market Opportunity 
 COVID-19 Market 
 As we begin living in a world with endemic COVID-19, we believe there is an opportunity for us to be the brand that provides accurate and easy-to-use COVID-19 testing to the OTC market, pending EUA authorization.  Due to COVID-19’s asymptomatic invisible spread, we believe there will be continued and increased need for COVID-19 negative verification testing as people begin to gather again in both large public spaces, as well as smaller gatherings with friends. Additionally, we believe there is a significant opportunity for POC, especially prescription at-home testing of infectious diseases. 
 COVID-19 diagnostic testing volume in the United States grew rapidly to approximately 250 million tests in 2020. First quarter 2021 testing volume is estimated at approximately 150 million tests. Molecular testing accounts for approximately one-third of all COVID-19 tests conducted, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, POC reimbursement is approximately $50 per test. Testing volumes are based on the traditional testing infrastructure as there are currently no COVID-19 tests widely offered in the prescription at-home or OTC settings. This represents a current market spend of approximately $6.0 billion for molecular COVID-19 testing. The POC reimbursement rate is the amount that a provider receives and does not represent our actual revenue per test kit. We intend to evaluate our test kit pricing on a channel-specific basis, factoring in market dynamics and believe our revenue per test kit will vary over time. In the future, we anticipate the percentage of molecular tests to grow due to the continued awareness of its clinical relevancy, increased performance, ease of use and expanded availability in the POC, prescription at-home and OTC settings. According to some estimates, approximately 30% of all COVID-19 tests are conducted for symptomatic patients. We estimate our total available COVID-19 test kit market to be in excess of this as our pending EUA authorizations, if received, for our COVID-19 test kit are indicated for people who are both asymptomatic and who are suspected of COVID-19. Pending EUA authorizations, we believe our total available COVID-19 test kit market would increase to include the remainder of the testing opportunity and potentially expand this opportunity as more routine applications for testing would become available. Ellume Limited, or Ellume, received an EUA from the FDA for OTC use of its COVID-19 test; however, it is an antigen test and as seen in Ellume’s FDA labeling, healthcare professionals are advised that negative results and positive results in asymptomatic people should be considered presumptive and additional testing with a highly sensitive molecular COVID-19 test may be necessary. In March 2021, the FDA issued an EUA to Cue Health Inc., or Cue, for its OTC molecular COVID-19 test. From December 2020 through February 2021, the FDA issued EUAs for three COVID-19 vaccines; however, we believe the need for ongoing detection and monitoring will continue to be high even after effective vaccines have been widely distributed and compliantly administered given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We also believe COVID-19, like influenza, will remain endemic for the foreseeable future and people suspected of ILI may want to purchase a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit to confirm their diagnosis in order to receive timely and appropriate treatment and quarantine themselves if and as needed. We believe that to successfully combat infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza, testing, vaccines and therapeutics all need to be deployed. We believe our testing platform is well suited to provide accurate, decentralized testing. 
 We plan to develop a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit for the POC and prescription at-home markets. We additionally believe there to be demand for an OTC COVID-19 test kit for which we plan to commercially launch in the first half of 2021, pending EUA authorization, at a price point primarily consistent with our current POC test pricing. Long term, we believe that an OTC COVID-19 test kit would eventually need to be at a consumer-appropriate retail price which, based upon our analysis of the consumer healthcare market, is approximately $20 per test kit. 
 Influenza Market 
 The CDC estimates that approximately 35.5 million people in the United States were sick with influenza during the 2018-2019 influenza season; however, only an estimated 16.5 million patients visited a healthcare 
 10


provider for the treatment of influenza, suggesting there is a large potential market for at-home influenza testing across the broader population. We believe there is an unmet medical opportunity and potentially greater demand for influenza testing given the hurdles to accessibility in the traditional influenza testing infrastructure at the POC and in centralized laboratories. According to Nielsen Corporation figures from October 2019, approximately 70% of U.S. households, representing approximately 230 million people, purchased cough or cold-related medicines throughout the year, which we believe highlights the willingness of consumers to purchase products to treat the symptoms of ILI. Of this population, we believe it is likely that only a small percentage of people actually have influenza, but a larger population suspects they have it and would be candidates for testing. In addition, according to CDC figures from the peak of the influenza season in the United States (November 2019 to March 2020), the influenza positivity rate was approximately 20%. With approximately 40 million influenza tests performed annually in laboratory and POC settings in the United States, a 20% influenza positivity rate during influenza season, but approximately 230 million people purchasing products to treat the symptoms of ILI, we believe there is an unmet medical need from an undiagnosed population who could benefit from rapid at-home testing. If an influenza test was available in an OTC setting, we believe the total potential market spend could be in excess of $800 million based on current testing volumes and a retail price of approximately $20 per test kit. We believe the total addressable market could be up to approximately $4.0 billion based on an estimate that approximately 200 million people per year purchase treatments for the symptoms of ILI, according to Nielsen Corporation figures from October 2019, and an OTC retail price of approximately $20 per test kit, assuming that all people who purchase treatments for the symptoms of ILI would purchase an OTC influenza test. While Ellume and Cue have announced that they are developing an influenza at-home test, there are no FDA-approved influenza testing products available in the prescription at-home or OTC settings. We believe there is significant demand for accurate, affordable, consumer-friendly and accessible testing options. We believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will result in an increased desire to test when ILI symptoms present, as many influenza symptoms are similar to COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, there were more than 150 million influenza vaccine doses administered in the United States in each of the last three influenza seasons, and the influenza vaccine is only approximately 50% effective in adults, which we believe contributes to the continued need for influenza testing. 
 While we are initially focused solely on the U.S. opportunity, we believe there is a substantial market opportunity internationally. Further, we plan to conduct additional research and development activities to explore the potential of our platform to be used in additional indications, including other infectious diseases such as STIs and respiratory syncytial virus. 
 Infectious Disease Testing Industry Overview 
 Diagnostic tests and procedures are used to assist in the detection, monitoring and treatment of diseases and medical conditions through the examination of substances across various specimen types including nasal, saliva, blood, urine, and tissue, among others. The results of such tests can assist in the evaluation of health status, the detection of conditions or pathogens, treatment of disease and prevention of spread of disease. There are a number of different testing modalities and settings of care; which all serve to provide information to support clinical decision making. Traditional testing modalities were designed to be highly accurate for non-infectious diseases that do not require immediate results, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. As such, these testing modalities are not designed to support mass-population testing such as is required during outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases. The current centralized laboratory testing environment provides test results in two to 14 days and has not yet evolved to providing immediate, on-the-spot results. 
 Given the limitations of the current testing infrastructure, rapid antigen tests have emerged as an affordable stopgap in the POC setting. However, they lack the sensitivity to reliably identify active infection and often require follow-up confirmatory molecular testing. 
 Typical Patient Journey 
 People affected by infectious diseases can be either asymptomatic, not showing symptoms, or symptomatic, showing symptoms. Currently, there is not a widespread COVID-19 or influenza testing protocol for asymptomatic people due the general lack of convenient and accurate testing options. In order to begin testing of asymptomatic people, such as screening at airports, sporting events or restaurants, we believe it would require consumer-friendly, accurate testing that can deliver a result on-the-spot. 
 11


Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overwhelming majority of people exhibiting ILI symptoms did not seek medical treatment during early symptom onset. As an example, CDC data from the 2013-2014 influenza season showed that approximately 70% of people experiencing ILI symptoms did not go to the doctor for at least three to five days, which placed them outside the required 48-hour treatment window necessary for anti-viral treatment to be effective. In contrast, according to Nielsen Corporation figures from October 2019, approximately 70% of U.S. households, representing approximately 230 million people, purchased cough or cold medicines throughout the year; which we believe highlights the willingness of people to purchase products to treat the symptoms of ILI. We believe being able to provide an at-home testing opportunity would allow for testing to be conducted sooner after symptom onset and with the potential to mitigate the spread, as people self-isolate after learning of a positive result and receive appropriate treatment. We believe the need for ongoing detection and monitoring will continue to be high given hyper-sensitivity to ILI symptoms and broader awareness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Testing Setting Overview 
 Current settings of care for the most common diagnostic testing include centralized high or medium-complexity laboratories, near-patient or POC, and at-home settings. These care settings range in their current testing capabilities due to several factors including cost, time to results, and expertise and instrumentation required to run the test. 
 Centralized High or Medium-Complexity Laboratories 
 In centralized high or medium-complexity laboratory testing, a sample must be obtained and delivered to centralized facilities for processing. The patient sample is collected at a physician’s office or at a third-party collections site where the infectious person comes into contact with healthcare providers and poses a threat of spread. The sample goes into a sample transport medium (to preserve the sample) and is physically delivered, by mail or courier, to a centralized facility where it can be processed and analyzed. Some laboratories use high throughput technology that employs automated processing of more than 200 specimens a day. The results are then either sent electronically to the POC, where the physician provides the results, or directly to the patient. The high-complexity laboratory approach typically has the longest turnaround time ranging from 24 hours to two weeks or longer depending on factors including the time to acquire the sample, sample delivery times, facility testing queue, processing time and delivery of results to the physician or patient. 
  
• | Remote Sample Collection: Outside of a physician’s office or at a third-party collections site, a person can also collect a sample in his or her own home, but the sample must still be sent to another location, usually a centralized laboratory, for processing. Recently, to address the limitations in mass-population testing, remote sample collection has emerged as another option to acquire additional samples. These tests do not produce an immediate result but rather require the patient to wait several days for the result and they still require specialized infrastructure at centralized laboratories for processing. Remote sample collection is typically seen in senior care facilities or large companies where bulk testing of a closed population is required.

 Point-of-Care 
 POC testing refers to near-patient testing and typically occurs at the time of consultation with a medical professional. POC testing can occur at hospitals, physicians’ offices, urgent care clinics and retail clinics, which poses a threat of spread given the presence of infectious people in those settings. Patient samples are collected in-person and the sample is usually transported to a nearby specialized instrument. These specialized instruments usually have a streamlined workflow that makes the test less complicated to run and allows for a broader set of instrument users. However, these tests may still require a trained person to collect the sample and perform the test, which can produce results in anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours assuming the instrument is ready to be used and there is no queue or maintenance needed. Depending on processing time and proximity of the lab, test results can be communicated as early as the time of consultation but typically require additional time and may be provided up to several days later. The potentially infectious person may still come into contact with healthcare providers and pose a threat of spread. 
 12


There are a variety of FDA-approved molecular and antigen COVID-19 tests in the POC setting. Our goal is to be an entrant in the on-the-spot molecular POC setting. 
 Prescription At-home Testing 
 The goal of prescription at-home testing is to allow people to administer the test and obtain results without needing a trained person to assist. These tests are typically designed to be intuitive and easy-to-use with minimal workflow steps to minimize user error. They usually have simple sample collection mechanics such as nasal or saliva swabs or urine collection sticks and are usually able to produce easily interpreted results in under 60 minutes. Prescription at-home tests can be delivered to the patient’s home, meaning the test can be performed without the patient leaving his or her home. When patients can conduct a test and obtain an accurate, on-the-spot result in the convenience of their home, they can immediately self-isolate and reach out to a healthcare provider, thereby mitigating the spread of disease. 
 While there are FDA-authorized tests for remote or at-home sample collection, ours is the first FDA-authorized, under an EUA, COVID-19 test kit that can be fully self-administered and provide results at home. 
 OTC Testing 
 OTC testing refers to test kits available for purchase at retail and ecommerce locations such as drug stores, grocery stores, or other large retailers. OTC testing does not require a prescription and does not typically qualify for reimbursement. At-home pregnancy tests are an example of OTC testing. 
 Currently there is only one FDA-authorized molecular test that is available OTC for COVID-19 and we are not aware of FDA-approved influenza testing products available OTC. In February 2021, we submitted an application for OTC EUA authorization. The OTC EUA authorization is pending as of the date of this filing. We anticipate working toward OTC approval in the United States for our influenza test kit. 
 Infectious Disease Testing Modalities 
 There are a number of different testing modalities, or techniques, that are used to determine the presence of a pathogen or a proxy of the infectious disease. Each modality provides different clinically useful information due to its inherent differences and testing limit. A large number of infectious disease tests usually fall into one of three categories: molecular tests, antigen tests and antibody tests. Molecular tests have the lowest LoD of the testing modalities, which is better because it allows the test to detect the presence of lower amounts of viral genetic material and may allow it to identify contagious people earlier. Antigen tests have emerged as a category of stopgap tests that address the needs for portability and affordability, but they do not generally provide a balanced level of accuracy across identifying both positives and negatives. Antibody tests have limited clinical relevance because they do not test for active infection and therefore do not indicate whether a person is actively contagious. 
Limit of Detection 
 LoD is the defining measure of an assay’s ability to reliably detect the presence of a specific target, such as viral RNA or protein. It is defined as the lowest target concentration at which the assay is able to generate a positive result ≥95% of the time. Tests with lower LoDs are more sensitive than tests with higher LoDs as the former can detect positive samples with low viral load. Typically, molecular tests have a much lower LoD compared to other testing modalities given their ability to amplify a target. There is not a standard way to measure LoD, but the predominant industry measure is cps / mL VTM equivalent. Among the current best performing molecular assays, the LoD is 1,000 cps / mL VTM equivalent or lower. In contrast, antigen tests, which do not amplify the target, are inherently less sensitive than molecular tests and thus are not considered diagnostically definitive, often requiring follow-on molecular confirmatory testing. 
 13


As of December 31, 2020, the table below generally summarizes the different characteristics across the three testing modalities in the prescription market.

Molecular Tests 
 Molecular tests target the viral genetic material (DNA or RNA) and are considered to be the most reliable due to high accuracies afforded by molecular amplification technologies, such as PCR, and LAMP. For COVID-19, molecular tests have a median LoD of 1,000 cps / mL VTM equivalent which makes them highly accurate. As a result of this high accuracy, molecular tests are able to detect diseases earlier in their incubation periods and are considered diagnostically definitive. Traditional infectious disease molecular tests require target amplification and fluorescence detection which necessitates specialized equipment that is expensive and complex. The need for specialized instrumentation also necessitates trained personnel, equipment maintenance and suitable infrastructure. These factors traditionally require the test be conducted in centralized locations such as high or medium-complexity laboratory environments and more recently in a POC setting such as a medical office or in emergency rooms. The closer to the patient the test is performed, generally the faster the result due to reduced sample transit logistics. However, large centralized laboratory testing instruments have historically provided more accurate results than POC instruments. The total turnaround time from sample collection to result may take up to two weeks. Traditionally the localization of these tests due to their complexity does not make them conducive to decentralized, mass-population testing. 
Antigen Tests 
 These tests target the viral protein proxies of the target pathogen instead of the viral genetic material themselves. Given that there is no amplification in antigen tests, they have a high LoD and low sensitivity and as a result can produce false negative results. The utility of this test is limited to highly infectious people who are already exhibiting apparent symptoms. Antigen tests do not capture the earlier stage of infection when people are most contagious and may not be showing obvious symptoms. While antigen tests can be used to detect a certain band of infectious people, they are unlikely to catch the full spectrum of infectious people given their lack of sensitivity. We believe antigen tests have become a stopgap measure for mass-population testing because they are rapid, low-cost and portable. They are not considered diagnostically definitive, however, like molecular tests and are often followed up by molecular confirmatory testing. 
Antibody Tests 
 These tests target human antibodies which are produced after the body has encountered and responded to a pathogenic threat. Antibodies can exist in the blood at varying amounts and times depending on the individual immune response and the specific pathogen. The existence of antibodies usually occurs well after a person is infectious and thus antibody tests confirm whether, not when, there has been exposure to a certain pathogen. Furthermore, there are current indications that certain people may develop antibodies in response to COVID-19 that begin to greatly diminish shortly after an initial infection, thereby allowing for the possibility of reinfection and diminished immunity. As such, antibody tests are not conducive for infectious disease control because they do not detect active infection or, in the case of COVID-19, accurately predict immunity. 
Current Testing Approaches and their Limitations 
 Decentralized, mass-population testing for infectious diseases including COVID-19 and influenza is necessary to mitigate the spread of infectious disease, but implementing mass-testing with traditional testing approaches has significant limitations. Mass-population testing requires tests that offer on-the-spot test results with molecular accuracy in a portable, affordable and easy-to-use format. 
 Traditional testing modalities were designed to be highly accurate for non-infectious diseases that do not require immediate results, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Even for seasonal infectious diseases, such as influenza, our current testing paradigm is not effective to mitigate spread. Most people do not visit a physician until they have had symptoms for three to five days, at which point they likely have already been contagious and spread the disease. Further, studies have shown that anti-viral influenza treatments are most effective within 48 hours of symptom onset. Traditional testing options were not designed to support mass-population testing such as what is required during outbreaks of highly contagious diseases. As evidenced by the rapid spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the inability to control its spread without the use of blunt and prolonged social controls such as lockdowns and social distancing, the current testing paradigm has failed to be an effective tool due to a number of factors. 
 15


Traditional infectious disease testing modalities have been limited by and made inaccessible to the consumer by one or more of the following attributes: 
  
• | Complexity. Molecular tests and some antigen tests (both in centralized laboratory or POC settings) require special instrumentation and trained personnel for processing samples. Samples must typically be placed in sample transport medium and carefully preserved while being transported to facilities that process these tests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Time to result. Due to complex workflows and sample transportation needs, time to results can range from a few days to weeks despite actual testing times ranging from less than 15 minutes to a few hours.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited clinical relevance. The critical answer sought in infectious disease testing is whether or not a person is infectious. This is important both from a control perspective (to avoid spread) and treatment perspective, such as in influenza, where treatments are effective within the first 48 hours after symptom onset. From an infectious disease control standpoint, antigen tests have limited clinical relevance given the narrow window in which they return a positive result and potentially miss an active infection, producing a false negative result. Antibody tests do not detect active infection but rather say whether, not when, a person was infected. These tests have value, but they are not effective in accurate identification of infection and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. We believe immediate, on-the-spot testing is needed to help mitigate the spread during outbreaks of highly contagious diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expensive and inaccessible. Centralized laboratory tests are expensive. For COVID-19, molecular tests in high throughput laboratories are currently reimbursed at $100 per test if results are returned within two days and $75 if results are returned after two days. Non-high throughput tests are reimbursed at approximately $51. Many of these tests can cost over $50 and require a significant upfront cost to purchase specialized instrumentation, making them cost-prohibitive for retail stores and people seeking at-home testing. Furthermore, most current testing options require patients to physically go to a testing center or visit a medical professional for sample collection. This frictional cost prevents many people who should be tested from being tested in time due to the unavailability of the care provider or person. The expense and inaccessibility of testing are significant barriers to mass-population testing.

Our Solution 
 The U.S. healthcare system’s current testing infrastructure was designed and built around addressing non-infectious diseases, and it does that very well; however, we believe it was not designed to test large populations quickly, safely, accurately and affordably. Outbreaks of highly contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza, require immediate, mass-population testing. COVID-19’s asymptomatic spread also presents opportunities for ongoing negative verification testing.  We believe that our solution not only addresses these systemic issues within the United States but has the potential to be applied globally as well. 
 Providing an accurate and easy-to-use test kit that allows potentially infectious people to test themselves anywhere, including in the safety of their own homes, is one of the best ways to help mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. We believe decentralized use of our consumer-friendly test kits can transform the way we mitigate the spread by testing contagious people at home and avoiding exposure to others in the community. Our platform can also provide a convenient way for large and small populations to perform negative verification testing, such as for sporting events, workplaces, travel and indoor gatherings.
 With our platform, we aim to respond to the limitations of the current infectious disease testing infrastructure through proprietary technology that delivers on-the-spot results with molecular accuracy in a portable and consumer-friendly test kit. Our platform is designed to combine the accuracy and reliability of molecular tests and the speed and affordability of antigen tests to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and influenza. Additionally, as a molecular test, our COVID-19 test kit is more sensitive than antigen tests on the market today.  We believe our platform gives us the ability to potentially provide mass-population testing for COVID-19 and influenza anywhere and at any time.

We designed our platform from the ground up to be able to provide accurate, easy-to-use, affordable and convenient infectious disease test kits, and our COVID-19 test kit can provide a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes. Our platform has four key attributes: (1) robust target identification, (2) colorimetric assay, (3) consumer-friendly test kit and (4) flexible assay architecture. We use our expertise in infectious disease, virology and bioinformatics in support of our target identification efforts. Once a target has been identified, we develop assays to amplify and detect the target through a combination of LAMP and proprietary colorimetric detection chemistry. These assays are then stabilized and packaged in the consumer-friendly design of our test kits. Our COVID-19 test kit was designed for high usability and high accuracy while also being purpose-built for low-cost manufacturing. Under the POC and prescription at-home EUA we received, our COVID-19 test kit is eligible for reimbursement in POC settings as a molecular POC test, and we are working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to determine the reimbursement pathway for prescription at-home use. Unlike other testing modalities currently in the market, our test kits are consumer-friendly, accurate and can be used anywhere. 
 COVID-19 Test Kit 
 Our COVID-19 test kit is easy-to-use with three steps and provides ‘swab-to-result’ within 30 minutes. Our platform is designed to address needs that other testing solutions do not. Our COVID-19 test kit provides the accuracy and reliability of a centralized laboratory, but in an affordable, portable, convenient and easy-to-use test kit that could fill the need for mass-population COVID-19 testing. 
 The following picture depicts our COVID-19 test kit. 
 
Our COVID-19 test kit contains everything needed to perform one COVID-19 test, including: (1) quick reference instructions that provide step-by-step instructions for use, (2) one sterile nasal swab for self-collection of a nasal specimen in the lower nostrils, (3) one sample vial that contains liquid buffer into which the swab is stirred, (4) one test unit base that contains the chemistry and displays the result, (5) two AA batteries to power the test unit base and (6) one disposal bag to dispose of the test kit in regular waste.

Fundamentally, our platform has the following four key attributes: 
 1. Robust target identification.
 
• | The first step of the development process is identification of the genetic target. The target is a small stretch of the pathogen’s genetic material that will be amplified and detected by our colorimetric assay. We have developed robust, proprietary in-house capabilities for identifying such targets for a broad range of pathogens. Through our innovative platform, we are able to identify and test potential targets against large databases of available sequences of the pathogen of interest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Colorimetric assay.
 
• | Amplification: Once targets have been identified, we can begin to design assays that allow for amplification and detection of these targets in patient samples. Amplification chemistry is the process by which a single copy of the target is copied to “amplify” its abundance, and the process helps detection chemistries identify the pathogenic target of interest in a sample. We use a form of amplification called LAMP. LAMP allows for target amplification powered by just two AA batteries, unlike other amplification methods which require more power.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Detection: Unlike most assay chemistries, which rely on the use of fluorescent signals to detect amplification, we use our proprietary colorimetric chemistry for detection. This eliminates the need for complex and expensive instrumentation. Using colorimetric detection, as amplification proceeds the color of the reaction changes and is monitored using inexpensive LEDs and photosensor elements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. Consumer-friendly test kit.
 
• | Usability: Our test kit brings centralized laboratory accuracy in an intuitive, consumer-friendly design that uses a simple, three-step “swab, stir, detect” sequence and comes with clear instructions and all the necessary components (including two AA batteries) to operate it. Furthermore, our test kit displays a clear result that users can correctly identify, thus eliminating the subjectivity of user confirmation. This minimalist design and workflow is intended to ensure high usability and broad accessibility, with the goal of enhancing our test kit’s appeal for decentralized, mass-population testing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designed for automated, low-cost manufacturing: Our test kits were specifically designed for low-cost production at scale. This was enabled by intentional design choices that allow for low-cost hardware by eliminating the need for pumps and valves. Colorimetric uses inexpensive LEDs, and photosensors. As we reach threshold production volume, our test kits were designed to be manufactured at costs low enough to be sold profitability to consumers, at a price point attracting significant OTC consumer purchase demand. Our purpose-built supply chain is expected to allow us to cost-effectively address mass-population infectious disease testing needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. Flexible assay architecture. 
  
• | In support of our goal to design and provide a platform with broad applicability, we designed our platform to allow us to adapt the test unit bases into which chemistries are run to the development of new assays addressing additional infectious diseases. We anticipate that our colorimetric detection in our test unit base can be used in a broad range of applications and that the test unit bases can be applied to other indications with minor modifications and an indication-specific disease pellet. Our platform is further capable of expanding the number of independent reaction chambers that in turn increases our ability to multiplex.

We believe the elements comprising our platform create test kits that, if approved, are capable of bringing accurate, reliable, on-the-spot infectious disease testing anywhere, at any time. We received an EUA from the FDA for our COVID-19 test kit in the POC, prescription at-home setting.
Benefits of our Platform 
 We believe our platform addresses historical challenges and unlocks the ability to provide mass-population infectious disease testing anywhere and at any time. Because our platform is designed to be portable and easy-to-use, people will be able to take the test anywhere, including at home. This would greatly reduce the burden and risks placed on public health facilities when people would otherwise travel to them for testing. Since our easy-to-use platform has been designed to provide results quickly, people will also quickly know if they are potentially infectious and can immediately begin avoiding contact with others to mitigate disease spread. 
 We believe our platform combines the benefits of accuracy and reliability of a centralized laboratory test with the speed, ease of use and affordability of an antigen test. According to many virologists, the most important time to mitigate the spread of infectious disease is early in its infectious period, but in a typical influenza scenario, a patient generally waits to get tested until a few days after symptom onset. We believe that testing both suspected cases and asymptomatic people, accurately detecting infection early and giving people an opportunity to isolate and treat early provides a critical opportunity to mitigate the spread of infectious disease. With our platform’s proprietary technology, we designed our test kits to detect infections early, therefore mitigating the spread of an infectious disease and filling an important gap in the current testing infrastructure. Our test kits’ portability and ability to deliver on-the-spot results make it possible to administer in places not equipped for POC testing. Eventually, we expect our test kits, if approved, to become widely available for testing at other high-traffic locations, such as large venues, airports, train stations, malls and museums. We also anticipate employers, local governments, school districts, businesses and travelers can use our test kit, if approved, to frequently and affordably test themselves and others before engaging in large gatherings, travel and in-person school and office work. 
 We believe our platform is designed to benefit stakeholders through a testing platform that has the following characteristics: 
  
• | Molecular accuracy. Accurate testing, which we measure using LoD, is paramount in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. A test’s ability to detect if someone is infectious is dependent on the test’s LoD: a measure of how much virus is required for the test to generate a positive result. With an LoD of 900 cps / mL VTM equivalent, our COVID-19 test kit has a comparable LoD to other known high sensitivity PCR assay tests, including those offered in centralized laboratories. In contrast, antigen tests are not as sensitive and will only yield positive results for people with a high viral load, meaning they can return negative results even in people at the start of infection who may be contagious. This is why antigen tests are often limited to use among individuals in their first seven days of symptoms and include labeling guidance that antigen tests are not diagnostically definitive and may require follow-on confirmatory molecular testing. Achieving the right level of sensitivity is important: at the beginning of an infection, a high enough sensitivity is needed to accurately pinpoint when a person is contagious despite having a lower viral load, and later in infection a low enough sensitivity is needed to avoid assigning a positive result to a person who has long recovered and stopped being contagious. Unlike other tests on the market, our COVID-19 test kit is designed to deliver a reliable result across the entire disease spectrum with the potential to provide a public health benefit of accurate results at the critical early stages of infection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simple, intuitive test kit. We designed our test kits to have a consumer-friendly, three-step “swab, stir, detect” sequence and come with clear, one-page instructions and all the necessary components, including two AA batteries, to operate the test and obtain the result. Our proprietary colorimetric technology and proprietary buffer display the result in a light-up display that is clear and easy to read. Further, the single-use nature of our test kit eliminates the need for clean-up and testing slowdown often associated with centralized laboratory or POC tests. In our usability studies, approximately 97% of users said our COVID-19 test kit met or exceeded their expectations with regard to ease of use, whereas many molecular tests require specialized equipment and trained personnel for operation.

• | Portable ‘swab-to-result’ within 30 minutes. Our COVID-19 test kit is approximately 2” x 2” x 2” and fits in the palm of a hand. It was designed to produce a clinically relevant COVID-19 result within 30 minutes, with the potential for a positive COVID-19 result in as few as 11 minutes. Portability and a quick time to result is beneficial when dealing with infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza as it allows people to take the test anywhere, quickly determine if they are infected, quarantine if needed and thereby reduce infection rates. One of the critical issues with testing during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the time required to receive results – our COVID-19 test kit is designed to address this challenge by providing a clinically relevant result within 30 minutes. Molecular tests completed in centralized laboratories can take days or weeks to report results, and antigen tests often require follow-on confirmatory tests, making their time to results slower and less clinically relevant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Affordable. We have purpose-built and designed our test kits to not have additional instrument costs and be a single, portable unit that can be manufactured and affordable at scale. At initial OTC launch, pending EUA authorization, we believe we will be able to offer a test kit at a price that is nearly equivalent to our current POC test pricing. Eventually, if we achieve scaled production, we believe we will be able to economically produce our COVID-19 test kits at a cost that enables us to be at a consumer appropriate retail price. Our POC pricing is priced at a modest premium to other POC tests, and we believe our test kit will differentiate us from our POC competitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible with potential for broad applicability. Our goal was to design and provide a robust testing platform with broad applicability for mass-population testing for infectious diseases. While our initial focus is within respiratory diseases, namely COVID-19 and influenza, we built our platform to be flexible and applicable to additional assays using the same core test kit. Specifically, our platform is capable of multiplexing, meaning multiple assays can be put on a single test kit. As an example of our platform’s agility and robustness, we leveraged over half a decade of research and development of our test kit and expertise in target identification and assay development for influenza into a test kit for COVID-19. We intend to pursue additional indications in the future, including other infectious diseases such as STIs and respiratory syncytial virus, and believe this component of our strategy and business model will be a core value driver for us over the long term.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Performance and Data 
 We have conducted a number of clinical trials to support our clinical performance as well as aggregate real-world patient data in order to support our initial FDA EUA application, which we filed on October 22, 2020, and our initial EUA for our COVID-19 test kit, which we received from the FDA on November 17, 2020. Subsequently, we completed a follow-on Community Testing study under the same protocol as the prior study used to submit our first EUA to include asymptomatic individuals. This data was submitted to FDA to support the expansion of our POC and prescription at-home EUA to include asymptomatic individuals and was also used to support a new EUA submission for OTC non-prescription use. Based on our clinical work completed to-date, we believe that our COVID-19 test kit shows the following key attributes: 

• | Real world data supporting on-the-spot testing, portability and clinical utility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Molecular accuracy performance on-par with known high sensitivity PCR centralized laboratory tests.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High usability across a broad population set including age.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Real World Data Supporting On-The-Spot Testing, Portability and Clinical Utility 
 Community Testing Studies 
 We have now completed two clinical trials, which we call our Community Testing Studies, to establish the clinical performance of our COVID-19 test kit under the intended use conditions. The first Community Testing Study was conducted among symptomatic individuals and was used to support the our first EUA submission.  The second Community Testing Study was conducted as a follow-on study among asymptomatic individuals and was 
 20


used as a basis to support the most recent EUA submissions.  In the symptomatic study, we enrolled COVID-19 known positive patients as well as symptomatic people not experiencing fever so long as they were experiencing at least three CDC COVID-19 symptoms and at least one symptom was either cough, shortness of breath and/or new loss of taste or smell. In the asymptomatic study, only asymptomatic subjects were enrolled.  Across both studies, subjects were tested outside their residence, and in the asymptomatic study, some tests were performed at a pop-up study clinic.  All enrolled subjects independently collected their nasal swab samples and ran our test. All subjects then collected a second nasal swab sample that was run in Sutter Health Shared Labs and the results were compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion. 
 A total of 404 subjects were enrolled across both of our Community Testing Studies. Our COVID-19 test kit achieved 92% (121/132) positive percent agreement, or PPA as compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion across all samples, and a 96% PPA (49/51) with discrepant testing.  Excluding samples with very low levels of virus that possibly no longer represented active infection (10 samples with cycle thresholds greater than 37.5 Ct), we achieved a 97% (118/122) PPA.  The Ct value is the number of cycles required to detect the viral target, and running more cycles (a higher Ct value) reflects detection of a lower amount of viral material. The 95% confidence intervals, or CI, for the total PPA were 85.5% to 98.4%. 
 Our negative percent agreement, or NPA, was 98%. The 95% CI for the total NPA were 89.4% to 99.9%. There was one invalid result in this trial (0.99%) that resulted in a retest, and two additional retests (1.98%) that were due to user errors where study staff prematurely provided a second test kit prior to letting the test complete to a possible invalid result. The following table summarizes the results of our Community Testing Studies using the Hologic Panther Fusion as a comparator: 
 
 
 | Total Subjects | Subjects with Ct ≤ 37.5
 | PPA | NPA | Accuracy | PPA | NPA | Accuracy 
Symptomatic | 94% (48/51) | 98% (49/50) | 96% (97/101) | 100% (45/45) | 98% (49/50) | 99% (94/95) 
Asymptomatic | 90% (73/81) | 98% (218/222) | 96% (291/303) | 95% (73/77) | 98% (218/222) | 97% (291/299)
Total | 92% (121/132) | 98% (267/272) | 96% (388/404) | 97% (118/122) | 98% (267/272) | 98% (385/394)

The graph below depicts our PPA summary from our Community Testing Studies comparing our COVID-19 test kit head-to-head to our FDA EUA authorized high sensitivity comparator, the Hologic Panther Fusion. The graph below shows Ct values of reference positive samples from our Community Testing Studies. Green color is used to show that our test result matched the Hologic Panther Fusion positive result. Grey color is used to show that our test result did not match the Hologic Panther Fusion reference test result. Ct values are shown in ascending order. 
 

Clinical Usability Data from our Community Testing Studies 
 Our Community Testing Studies also included usability measures in both their case reporting form to record swabbing attributes, as well as a patient questionnaire to assess overall usability and instructions clarity. Usability results from both our Community Testing Studies demonstrate that our COVID-19 test kit is easy to use and that 100% of enrolled subjects have been able to successfully run our COVID-19 test kit. Our Community Testing Study usability data is in line with our prior human usability study results, where approximately 96% of subjects stated that our COVID-19 test kit was “Easier or About What They Expected” and approximately 92% of subjects stated our instructions manual was “Extremely or Very Clear and Understandable.” 
Performance Summary 
 Results from our Community Testing Studies were submitted to support our FDA EUA applications for our COVID-19 test kit. The Community Testing Studies, which utilized the Hologic Panther Fusion as a comparator assay, achieved a 92% (121/132) PPA calculated across all samples and 97% (118/122) PPA achieved among all samples at or below the Ct value of 37.5. These results exceeded the FDA template objective of greater than 80% PPA for prescription at-home and POC use and greater that 90% PPA for OTC use. While our 98% (267/272) NPA was slightly below the FDA template of 99% NPA objective, the result is comparable to the reported NPA for many other EUA-authorized assays. 
 Moreover, all clinical data for our COVID-19 test kit were gathered in prospective trials conducted outside of clinical settings, which simulated the real-world use conditions. Therefore, the performance data obtained in these clinical trials are expected to be representative of the assay performance in the field. 
 Further, the Community Testing Studies demonstrated that our COVID-19 test kit can easily and successfully be used by untrained users in a home and non-laboratory setting. With the exception of three senior living residents over the age of 80, all of the enrolled subjects in the Community Testing Studies used our COVID-19 test kit on their own, using our instructions manual provided with our COVID-19 test kit. In our symptomatic 
 22


study, many of these users were noticeably symptomatic and not feeling well and all of them conducted this test standing outside their residence. In addition, we have worked with nearly 1,000 users to optimize our COVID-19 test kit workflow and instructions manual. 
 We had also begun a study with Sutter Health, or the Sutter Health Trial, prior to initiating the first symptomatic Community Testing Study, but enrollment was negatively impacted by the California wildfires and it was not possible to complete the study objectives within the authorized study timeframe.  Because the first Community Testing Study provided sufficient data for our first FDA EUA submission, the time frame for the Sutter Health Trial was not extended. The Sutter Health Trial only enrolled 2 COVID-19 positive subjects before it was closed out and both samples matched the test result provided by the Hologic Panther Fusion.
 Cleveland Clinic Clinical Trial 
 The Cleveland Clinic Clinical Trial is near completion and we expect to close out this study in the second quarter of 2021. Our COVID-19 test kit was compared to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay in this clinical trial. Our data for this clinical trial, summarized in the table below, are through March 1, 2021 and are interim in nature.  There have been three invalids in the Cleveland Clinic Clinical Trial.

 | Comparators | 
---------------------------------+-------------+---------
Our COVID-19 Test Kit | Positive | Negative | Total
Positive | 58 | 2 | 60 
Negative | 2 | 29 | 31 
Total | 60 | 31 | 91 
Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) | | | 97% 
Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) | | | 94% 

Molecular Accuracy Performance On-Par with Centralized Laboratory Tests 
 Limit of Detection—Analytical Sensitivity 
 As previously described, LoD is the defining measure of an assay’s ability to reliably detect the presence of a specific target, such as viral RNA or protein. It is defined as the lowest target concentration at which the assay is able to generate a positive result more than 95% of the time. Molecular assays tend to have lower LoD, which equates to higher sensitivity resulting from their nucleic amplification. This provides a significant sensitivity or LoD advantage compared to antigen tests which do not amplify or multiply the viral sample. 
 The chart below shows the distribution of LoDs among 185 FDA-authorized molecular assays on a cps / mL VTM equivalent basis. The most accurate molecular assays have an LoD of 1,000 or less cps / mL VTM equivalent basis. While our COVID-19 test kit utilizes a direct swab method whereby the swab goes directly into the sample vial and does not require VTM, our LoD is 900 cps / mL VTM equivalent, placing it among one of the most accurate molecular assays currently available. Our LoD, like other high-performing, known high-sensitivity 
 23


molecular assays, is also significantly more sensitive than antigen assays. Plot points higher in the graph are lower LoD which is more sensitive and considered more accurate. 
 

 
(1) | The FDA’s EUA regulatory environment for COVID-19 tests is rapidly changing. This chart references data as of November 2020 with the exception of the addition of prescription at-home and OTC sample-to-result tests authorized through March 15, 2021.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To support our LoD for our FDA EUA submission, we followed the FDA’s template guidance for calculating LoD. Quantified heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus was serially diluted in a natural nasal swab matrix, 35 µL was pipetted onto a fresh, unused nasal swab and run on two test kit lots. The LoD for the test kit was determined by testing three target concentrations on each lot of test kits. For each lot, each concentration was tested in replicates of seven test kits by three unique operators, for a total of 21 replicates per concentration. The LoD for each lot was separately determined as the lowest concentration of genome copy equivalents per swab that yielded greater than 95% positive results. The preliminary LoD for the test kit was defined as the highest LoD of the two lots. 
 The following table summarizes our LoD data submitted to the FDA: 
 
 
Genome Equivalent / Swab (per reaction) | | Positive/Total Valid | Percent Positive | 
----------------------------------------+-------+----------------------+-------------------+------------------
 | | | Preliminary Lot 1 | Preliminary Lot 2 | Confirmatory | Preliminary Lot 1 | | Preliminary Lot 2 | | Confirmatory
2,700(1) | | 20/21 | 20/21 | 20/20 | 95.2% | | 95.2% | | 100% | 
 | 1,350 | | 18/21 | 20/21 | — | 85.7% | | 95.2% | | — 


(1) | 2,700 cp / swab is determined as LoD and is equivalent to 900 cps / mL of VTM equivalent assuming 100% elution of the swab in 3 mL of VTM.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The LoD for Lot 1 was determined to be 2,700 copies per swab, while Lot 2 was 1,350 copies per swab. As such, 2,700 copies per swab was reported as the preliminary LoD. The LoD was confirmed by testing 20 replicates at the preliminary LoD concentration on a single lot. All 20 of 20 test kits at this concentration were positive.

High Usability Across a Broad Population Set 
 Overview and Methodology 
 In addition to our Community Testing Studies, we conducted an FDA EUA human usability study among a total sample of 398 healthy, non-symptomatic users to evaluate the ability of various ages, ethnicities and education levels to successfully run our COVID-19 test kit. This usability work was completed across two clinical trials as a second trial to include parent-assisted collections of minors was added after reviewing the FDA template published on July 29, 2020. 
 Prior to these usability studies, we conducted extensive usability work involving nearly 500 people in five locations and three states (California, North Carolina, and Ohio) in the beginning of 2020. These prior studies provided an opportunity to optimize our COVID-19 test kit workflow and instructions manual prior to conducting the FDA EUA human usability study to support our EUA for our COVID-19 test kit. 
 Results 
 Overall, we achieved the FDA EUA submission human usability study endpoints among all English-speaking subjects aged 14 and older. The only age cohort that did not sufficiently meet the desired length of time swabbing during self-collection endpoint were younger teens aged 12 to 13, and this age cohort was not included in the first EUA indicated population for self-collection for prescription at-home use. 
Usability Endpoint 1: Ability to Follow the Instructions to Start Our COVID-19 Test Kit 
 Our human usability study showed 100% of users aged 14 and above were able to follow the instructions to start the test running (successfully perform our COVID-19 test kit from beginning to end), exceeding the 95% endpoint objective. These results demonstrate our COVID-19 test kit can be performed by untrained users of a broad range of ages. These results are further corroborated by additional ease of use and instructions clarity data with respect to our proposed instructions manual as follows: 

• | 97% (340/352) rated their experience as “Easier or About What They Expected”.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nearly 100% of users rated the overall test kit instructions (351/352) as sufficient to be able to understand how to perform the test.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 94% of users (330/352) rated the instructions as “Extremely or Very Clear” and only one 12-year old user (1/352) rated the instructions as “Not Very or Not At All Clear” (bottom two scores on a 1-5 scale).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | After using our COVID-19 test kit, 100% (352/352) of users across all age cohorts expressed confidence they could run the test at home on their own.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usability Endpoint 2: Test Results Interpretation 
 We conducted test results interpretation among adults only. Teens were not asked to interpret results as we expected that parents or guardians would be involved in the interpretation of the test results for minors. For this portion of the usability study, users were shown all three possible test results—positive, negative and invalid—in randomized order and asked to interpret each result. An invalid result is the term to describe a result that cannot be interpreted as being either “positive” or “negative.” Invalid results occur when a sample cannot be read or interpreted. They do not mean that a device has malfunctioned or failed, but rather are events that are known and expected to occur with in-vitro diagnostic tests. When an invalid result occurs, the patient needs to have a new sample tested. 
 25


The image below shows the display sample we asked our subjects to interpret. We achieved 100% test results interpretation accuracy. 
 

Usability Endpoint 3: Quality Nasal Swab Self-Collection 
 We studied two objectives related to our third endpoint – obtaining a quality nasal swab self-collection. The first objective was related to swabbing both nostrils. Our usability study results showed 99% of adults aged 18 and older, 98% of parents collecting on their children and 95% of teens aged 14 to 17 achieved the first objective of this endpoint. 
 The second objective was related to swabbing time. Adults aged 18 and older exceeded this objective of having a total swabbing time in both nostrils of at least 10 seconds, with 92% of adults having a swabbing time of at least 11 seconds and a median swabbing time of 18 seconds. Teens aged 14 to 17 were very close on this endpoint with 92% of older teens having a swabbing time of 9 seconds and a median swabbing time of 17 seconds. Parents also were very close on this endpoint with 90% of parents having a child collection swabbing time of 9 seconds and a median swabbing time of 13 seconds.
 This swabbing data which shows that users were successfully able to self-collect a nasal swab sample is further corroborated by the following additional usability study data: 
  
• | 99% of users rated the swab step instructions (348/352) as sufficient to be able to understand how to do the swab step.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 95% of users rated the swab step as “Not Very or Not At All Hard” (easiest two responses on a 1-5 scale).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our most recent FDA OTC EUA submission includes adult collections in children ages two to 13.  We had provided this parent collection data to FDA with the Company’s first EUA submission in November 2020. However, we did not seek an adult/parent collection indication in children with our first prescription at-home EUA. The FDA views our parent collection usability data as sufficient to support the adult/parent collection in children ages two to 13 in our OTC EUA submission and did not require any additional usability study data beyond what was included in our initial FDA EUA submission. Our usability study demonstrated that parents were successfully able to collect a nasal swab sample among the 52 parents enrolled in our usability study as described above.
 Previous Clinical Development 
 In the fall of 2019, we submitted to the FDA a dual 510(k) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, waiver submission for an influenza test kit based on clinical trials conducted in June 2018 in Santiago Chile and during the 2018 to 2019 influenza season in the United States. Applying discrepant analysis, both studies showed strong assay performance with specificity and sensitivity for influenza A and B viruses at or above 95%. However, there were two issues that led us to eventually withdraw our submission. First, the comparator did not detect influenza virus A as well as our assay did, thus negatively and artificially lowering our influenza virus A specificity to 92% in the study. When applying discrepant resolution, our influenza virus A specificity improved to 97%. Running this study with a single comparator that did not correctly identify at least 35 specimens as true 
 26


positives hindered our ability to obtain a CLIA waiver clearance because the FDA threshold for specificity is 95%. Second, there was a higher than anticipated rate of invalids at nearly 10%. Root cause analysis showed greater than half of the invalids were related to prototype manufacturing quality issues and, importantly, were not related to fundamental assay performance. We believe these issues have since been resolved and our influenza assay’s invalid rate is now less than 5%. After receiving an additional information letter from the FDA in January 2020 primarily regarding these issues, we withdrew our submission and turned our focus to COVID-19 assay development. 
 The following table shows our influenza clinical data from our 2018 and 2019 clinical trials in Chile and the United States.

 We have not yet commenced our clinical work relating to our combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 If we receive EUA OTC authorization, we believe we will have a first mover advantage as one of the first single-use molecular COVID-19 test kits authorized by the FDA under an EUA, and we deliver PCR quality accuracy in 30 minutes or less. Pending EUA authorization, we intend to leverage this position with a strong direct to consumer launch campaign beginning in the second quarter of 2021. Our OTC launch will focus on driving broad brand awareness and usage across U.S. households supported by national television advertising and a multi-channel marketing program. We will initially launch in the ecommerce channel and we expect to add retail distribution by the second half of 2021.  We also see business to business, or BTB, partnerships such as professional sports teams, travel and leisure companies and employer programs emerging as an important sales channel. Pending EUA authorization, we expect the OTC business to develop as a cash pay business.  Our OTC launch, if authorized, will be supported by experienced agencies who have deep expertise in driving brand awareness and revenues across both digital and retail channels. 
 Alongside OTC, pending EUA authorization, we will continue to develop the POC and prescription at-home business.  Where our COVID-19 test kit is being used in a large healthcare setting, it is being used with high satisfaction.  Additionally, we will be selling direct to physicians on our website.  We believe there is ample opportunity to provide a COVID-19 testing solution both to large healthcare networks and directly to physician practices.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, provides a basis for reimbursement for all COVID-19 diagnostic testing, when medically appropriate.  Our COVID-19 test kit, when used in POC settings, is presently reimbursed under the rapid molecular test category.
 Further, we plan to place our COVID-19 test kit into national pharmacy distribution by the second quarter of 2021 so that any physician can prescribe it for prescription at-home use.  The CARES Act, as noted, provides a basis for reimbursement for all COVID-19 diagnostic testing, when medically appropriate.  This establishes a basis for prescription at-home use of our test kit to be reimbursed, although prescription at-home use is not yet reimbursed by CMS. Our sales team currently consists of a Vice President of Sales to lead our OTC and POC efforts. During the remainder of 2021, we expect to hire additional sales representatives to support anticipated OTC national accounts, OTC BTB partnerships, and large healthcare providers and payors. Our direct to physician sales will be supported by an inside sales telehealth team and our customer support team.
 27


Subsequently, we plan to launch an added value combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit into the prescription at-home and POC channels. We are still evaluating alternatives for international expansion and we may decide to either partner through a distributor or go direct. 
 COVID-19 
 If we receive OTC EUA authorization, we intend to market and sell our COVID-19 test kit in the OTC channel in both ecommerce and retail distribution.  Being one of the first FDA EUA authorized single-use molecular test with PCR quality molecular accuracy provides us with an opportunity to establish a leadership position in anyplace, anywhere testing.  We plan to drive broad brand awareness and usage through a multi-channel media program that includes both national television advertising and coop programs with national retailers.  We will also cultivate partnerships in the professional sports, travel & leisure and employer segments where ongoing COVID-19 negative verification testing demand is expected to grow.  We expect to hire three to four additional sales reps to support our national retail, ecommerce and BTB business.
 Additionally, we will continue to market and sell our test kit in the POC setting through partnerships with healthcare systems, national payors, and direct to physician sales.  Importantly, our test kit is the first COVID-19 test with an FDA EUA that allows patients to test themselves and receive results for COVID-19 at home. We expect to hire an additional two sales reps to support our POC and prescription at home business.  Our direct to physician sales will be supported by our internal sales team.  
 We plan to continue conducting additional clinical trials which provide strong commercial claim support in two areas: (1) establishing our COVID-19 test kit as the COVID-19 test relied on and preferred by doctors in hospitals; and (2) to further differentiate our strengths compared to antigen tests. We expect to hire experienced marketing professionals to lead our brand development and support our brand development on ecommerce platforms.  
 Influenza 
 We plan to eventually apply directly for OTC approval for influenza and expand into influenza with the efficiency of a line extension leveraging our then existing customer relationships. 
Research and Development 
 As of December 31, 2020, our research and development, or R&D, team consisted of 20 people conducting research and product development activities. Our R&D team has been working on developing our platform over the last seven years and have optimized the device design, performance and usability over the course of several clinical and pre-clinical studies. Our R&D team is focused on three core areas: creation of new products for existing markets and unmet needs, advancing our innovation pipeline to further advance our differentiated platform product offerings, and sustaining engineering and cost reduction initiatives that continually improve device performance and lower our cost to manufacturer product. We have strong capabilities such as mechanical and electrical engineering, fluidics and software design in our engineering team and assay development, biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics in our assay development team. 
 Our main priorities are the continued development of additional indications, including other infectious diseases such as STIs and respiratory syncytial virus and initially focusing on a combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit. We are in the early stages of determining our platform’s applicability for other respiratory diseases. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We leverage a combination of internal and external manufacturing capabilities to manufacture the various components of our finished test kit. We have chosen to partner with Jabil, a leading global manufacturing solutions provider offering capacity expansion, sourcing expertise, and automation capabilities. We plan to make additional investments to increase capacity through automation and expansion of our manufacturing footprint 
 28


through our outsourced manufacturer. We created an equipment and process platform with the capability to be systematically replicated in a short time period to expand manufacturing capacity. Our primary manufacturing locations for the test unit base and sample vial production are in California as well as in Jabil’s facilities in Michigan with further expansion plans currently underway to enable significant scale up including in the Dominican Republic in the second quarter of 2021. In the future we intend to primarily rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our test kits. Outsourcing to third parties provides us expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our test kits. We have begun manufacturing activities with Jabil with a goal of establishing increased scale by the second half of 2021. We continue to investigate opportunities to enhance manufacturing capacity and efficiency to align with anticipated demand. 
 We have an established supply chain, based primarily in the United States. Many of the critical components are dual sourced with alternate suppliers identified and qualified. We have sourced and will continue to source test kit components, molds, reagents and other test kit materials from a limited number of suppliers or, in many cases, a single supplier. For example, our molds and many of our reagents are sole-sourced. In addition, we rely solely on Promega Corporation and New England BioLabs, Inc. for the supply of our current enzymes and primers. We intend to put in place framework agreements with certain of our single-source suppliers, including Promega Corporation and New England BioLabs, Inc., under which third-party contract manufacturers and/or suppliers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of such materials based on our development and commercial needs. As we advance our COVID-19 test kit through development, we are considering our lack of redundant supply for our current enzymes and primers in particular to protect against any potential supply disruptions. Our modular manufacturing approach coupled with our agile supply chain would provide us the flexibility to scale in-house with any partner. 
 Our manufacturing process and Jabil’s facilities and manufacturing processes are designed to comply with FDA’s Quality Systems Requirements and enable us to market our COVID-19 test kit into the clinical diagnostics and testing markets. Jabil operates its facilities in conformance with a variety of International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, certifications, with most of our healthcare facilities’ quality management systems meeting ISO 13485. We are licensed by the State of California to manufacture and distribute our test kits. 
 Manufacturing Services Agreement with Jabil 
 On September 10, 2020, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement, or the Jabil MSA, with Jabil, pursuant to which Jabil will manufacture, test, pack and ship certain electronic assemblies and systems in accordance with our specifications. Jabil may not subcontract any of its manufacturing services under the Jabil MSA without our prior written consent. We are obligated to provide, on a monthly basis, a rolling 12-month forecast to Jabil as well as 12-months of historical aggregate end customer demand at the finished product level, which will be used to constitute written purchase orders from us, and we are obligated to purchase the quantity of products that is required by the first four months of each forecast. Jabil is entitled to reject any purchase orders that are not placed in accordance with the forecast. 
 We are obligated to pay Jabil upon issuance of a purchase order based on a volume pricing matrix, pursuant to which Jabil will review the actual purchases during the then-ending quarter and compare against the forecasted orders in the upcoming quarter. If Jabil determines that the actual purchases correspond to a different pricing band in the volume pricing matrix, Jabil will either issue (a) a credit for any excess price paid by us if the actual price is lower than the invoiced price or (b) an invoice for any shortfall if the actual price is higher than the invoiced price. Jabil may adjust the volume pricing matrix to reflect changes in costs on the first anniversary of its notice to us that production qualification can commence, or after the addition of new equipment or labor. 
 The agreement is for an initial term of three years and automatically renewed for successive periods of one year, subject to either party’s notice of intent not to renew, delivered at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The Jabil MSA may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written consent of the parties. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party (a) at will upon at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party, (b) for cause based on a material breach by the other party, subject to a 30-day cure period and (c) for certain bankruptcy or insolvency events enumerated under the agreement. 
 29


Technology Services Agreement with Jabil 
 On September 10, 2020, we also entered into a technology services agreement, or the Jabil TSA, with Jabil, pursuant to which Jabil will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform certain technical services related to the development of components, assemblies and systems in relation to each project under the agreement as set forth in one or more statement of work, which may include our COVID-19 test kit and any of our future product candidates. 
 We are obligated to pay Jabil all amounts as set forth in each statement of work, which will specify the timeline and schedule for the performance of each service, the compensation to be paid by us to Jabil and other relevant terms and conditions. 
 After the initial term of three years, the Jabil TSA will automatically be renewed for successive periods of one year unless a party provides the other party with notice of its intention not to renew the agreement at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then current term. Either party may terminate the Jabil TSA at any time upon the mutual written consent of both parties. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by either party (a) at will upon at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party, (b) for cause based on a material breach by the other party, subject to a 60-day cure period and (c) for certain bankruptcy or insolvency events enumerated under the agreement. 
 Reporting 
 In order to facilitate the rapid and thorough public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act requires every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19 to report the results from each such test to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The CARES Act also authorized the HHS Secretary to identify the form and manner, as well as the timing and frequency, of such reporting. Based on subsequent guidance issued by the HHS on June 4, 2020, all laboratories, including testing locations operating as temporary overflow or remote locations for a laboratory, and other facilities or locations performing testing at POC or with at-home specimen collection related to SARS-CoV-2, will report data for all testing completed, for each individual tested, within 24 hours of results being known or determined, on a daily basis to the appropriate state or local public health department based on the individual’s residence. 
 In the POC setting and with our prescription at-home product, health care providers will be responsible for test results reporting to public health agencies according to federal, state and local regulations.  To facilitate this reporting, we expect to provide two methods to facilitate such reporting, including through an on-package photo guide that would allow users to upload results to secure physician portals and through a dedicated physician HIPAA compliant web-based test results reporting portal. 
 For OTC, pending EUA authorization, we have developed a secure portal named LUCI that is a text-based interface that is designed to allow users to easily receive a verified test result (LUCI Pass) on their phone and transmit their test result to the relevant public health authorities.
 Reimbursement 
 Coverage and reimbursement for our COVID-19 test kit will vary by setting of care, payor type, and region. In the United States, healthcare providers that purchase our COVID-19 test kits will likely look to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, accountable care organization, or ACOs, and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover and pay for the COVID-19 test kits. Sales volumes and prices of our COVID-19 test kits will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. 
 The CARES Act provides coverage for FDA EUA authorized COVID-19 tests when such tests are medically appropriate and ordered by a healthcare provider. Presently, COVID-19 testing coverage exists for tests run in clinical labs and POC settings. Under the EUA we received, our COVID-19 test kit is eligible for reimbursement in POC settings as a molecular POC test. While a coverage and reimbursement pathway is not yet in 
 30


place for prescription at-home use, the CARES Act provides a basis for coverage by health plans and group health insurers in this channel. We are working with CMS to establish a reimbursement pathway for prescription at-home use. 
 CMS covers medically appropriate COVID-19 testing and currently reimburses $100 for high throughput laboratory tests to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus if they return results within two days, $75 for such high throughput laboratory tests that take longer than two days to return results, $51 for such tests when not performed in high throughput laboratories (which would include our COVID-19 test kit) and around $42 for antibody tests. However, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability. We have active engagement with the relevant federal agencies regarding reimbursement status of our test. We continue to explore and enhance our coverage efforts with public and private payors. 
 For our POC indication, we expect to receive payment directly from POC customers and to not directly bill any third-party payors. For POC use, the success of our COVID-19 test kits will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our COVID-19 test kits will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and management healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products. 
 Reimbursement will play a less important role in the success of our product sold through our OTC indication, if we receive EUA authorization. Furthermore, if we achieve automation at scale, it would allow us to achieve a cost structure that will eventually optimize value to the consumer at OTC, pending EUA authorization. 
 Competition 
 The diagnostic testing industry, especially for COVID-19, is highly competitive, and given the significant interest and growth in COVID-19 related diagnostic tests, we expect ongoing intense competition from different sources, including from manufacturers and producers of diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutic treatments. 
 In diagnostic testing, we anticipate facing competition from companies that have or are developing molecular tests (including centralized laboratory and POC tests) as well as antigen and antibody tests. In March 2021, the FDA issued an EUA to Cue for its OTC molecular COVID-19 test. Antigen tests in particular are a source of competition because they are rapid and are already in use across the United States for mass-population testing. For example, In December 2020, the FDA updated the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card antigen test to include prescription at-home use among people suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset. In March 2021, the FDA issued an EUA to Quidel for its QuickVue COVID-19 antigen test to be used in the prescription at-home setting among people suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first six days of symptom onset.  In December 2020, the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test received an EUA from the FDA for OTC use; however, it is an antigen test and as seen in Ellume’s FDA labeling, healthcare professionals are advised that negative results and positive results in asymptomatic people should be considered presumptive and additional testing with a highly sensitive molecular COVID-19 test may be necessary. We face competition from companies developing at-home influenza tests, like Ellume, however we are currently not aware of FDA-approved influenza testing products available OTC. We also face competition from companies developing combination COVID-19 and influenza tests, including Quidel Corporation’s antigen combination test and a molecular combination test from Quest Diagnostics, Inc. We face potential competition from many sources, including academic institutions, public and private research institutions and governmental agencies. Competitors with diagnostic testing platforms include but are not limited to private and public companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, Cue, Danaher Corp., Bio-Rad Laboratories, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Becton, Dickinson and Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Siemens AG., BioMerieux SA, GenMark Diagnostics Inc., Qiagen, Sherlock Biosciences, Mammoth Biosciences, Everlywell, Inc., the CDC, Mesa Biotech, Inc., Quidel Corporation, Talis Biomedical Corporation, Visby Medical, Ginkgo Bioworks, Helix OpCo, LLC and Fluidigm Corporation. Large lab companies like Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America have also expanded beyond centralized laboratory testing into home sample collection. 
 31


In addition to competition from diagnostic testing companies, there are companies developing vaccines and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and influenza. From December 2020 through February 2021, the FDA issued EUAs for three COVID-19 vaccines. If existing or future vaccines are widely distributed and compliantly administered or if therapeutic treatments are identified and become widely used, then our testing opportunities and market interest may lessen or disappear. 
 We believe key competitive factors affecting our success in the POC rapid diagnostic market include pricing and reimbursement levels, time to result, ability to meet consumer demand, evidence of clinical performance and support by KOLs. We believe our portable, ‘swab-to-result’ molecular test kit that provides accurate, on-the-spot COVID-19 results within 30 minutes distinguishes us from our competitors. 
 Many of the companies against which we currently are competing or which we may compete with in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved test kits than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, services and technologies are introduced. Moreover, the entrance of new competitors is being encouraged by governmental authorities, which are offering significant funding to support development of testing solutions for COVID-19. Some of our existing or new competitors may have strong relationships with current and potential customers, including governmental authorities, and, as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing regulatory requirements, new or emerging technologies, and changes in customer requirements. Our COVID-19 test kit may not compete favorably, and we may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and technologies introduced by our existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. Any failure to compete effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Our success is contingent in part upon the successful development and commercialization of our COVID-19 test kit and our other assays from our platform that prove to be more effective and convenient than competing products in our target indications. We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are faster, more convenient or are less expensive than our COVID-19 test kit or any other test kits that we may develop. Our competitors also may be quicker and/or more successful than us in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how, including our COVID-19 test kit and our influenza test kit, as well as our LAMP technology and any of our future test kits; to defend and enforce our patents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our test kits and technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Part I. Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report.
 As of March 15, 2021, we owned four issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. utility patent applications, three issued foreign patents and 34 pending foreign patent applications. Our molecular diagnostic 
 32


platform is covered by three issued U.S. method and device patents, which include claims directed at methods and compositions for carrying out the molecular diagnostic assays on our platform and device claims covering our molecular diagnostic platform device. Additionally, we owned seven pending U.S. patent applications covering aspects of the device and composition used to run our molecular diagnostic assays, including those for COVID-19 and influenza. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. Our issued U.S. and foreign patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2038, and our U.S. pending patent applications and pending PCT applications, if issued into patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2039, excluding any additional patent term adjustment(s) or extension(s), and assuming payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees. Once a patent expires, patent protection ends and an invention enters the public domain allowing anyone to commercially exploit the invention without infringing the patent. 
 In addition, we hold design patents and patent applications that cover certain ornamental features of our platform device. As of March 15, 2021, we owned two allowed U.S. design patents, three pending U.S. design patent applications, nine European Community Design Registration applications, four Hong Kong design registrations, one Australian design registration and ten pending foreign design applications. Our allowed U.S. design patent and pending U.S. design patent applications, if issued into design patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2035 and 2037. Our foreign design registrations are anticipated to naturally expire between 2030 and 2045. 
 We cannot guarantee that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop methods or devices that are not covered by our patents or circumvent these patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which our test kits compete. Because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us, which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe. 
 There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using the product determined to be infringing, any of which could harm our business. See Part I. Item IA, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio. 
 We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand. As of March 15, 2021, we owned two U.S. pending intent-to-use trademark applications, one pending foreign trademark application in Canada and three foreign trademark registrations in Hong Kong, the Madrid Protocol and New Zealand. We also rely, in part, on unpatented trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information, to develop and maintain our competitive position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. However, such proprietary rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors, 
 33


or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our test kits or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Part I. Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in this Annual Report.
 License Agreement with Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. 
 In July 2020, we entered into a patent license agreement, or the Eiken Agreement, with Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., or Eiken. Pursuant to the terms of the Eiken Agreement, Eiken granted us a non-transferable, non-assignable, sublicensable (to our affiliates), non-exclusive license under certain patents, which we refer to collectively as the Eiken Licensed Patents, relating, in part, to LAMP, to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale and dispose of any reagent, product, kit, device, equipment and/or system for nucleic acid-based in-vitro diagnostic tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, which we collectively refer to as the Initial Licensed Products, in the United States. We also have limited have-made rights with respect to the Eiken Licensed Patents. 
 Under the terms of the Eiken Agreement, we also have an option to expand the license to the Eiken Licensed Patents for the Initial Licensed Products outside of the United States for a payment of additional fees. In addition, we also have an option to expand the license to the Eiken Licensed Patents for new targets beyond the purpose of testing COVID-19 in the United States, which we collectively refer to as the Additional Licensed Products, and together with the Initial Licensed Products, the Licensed Products, for a payment of a one-time fee for each Additional Licensed Product and an additional fee for the expansion of the licensed territory outside of the United States for each Additional Licensed Product. 
 As partial consideration of the rights granted to us under the Eiken Agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment to Eiken of $23,778. We are also required to pay Eiken $24,141 (based on the December 31, 2020 conversion ratio of 103.56 yen to one U.S. dollar) by July 2021. In addition, we are obligated to pay a royalty in the low single-digit percentage on total net sales of all Licensed Products. 
 The Eiken Agreement will terminate on the expiration date of the last to expire valid claim of the Eiken Licensed Patents in all countries, the latest of which is June 2031. We may also terminate the Eiken Agreement at any time upon a certain number of days’ prior written notice to Eiken after Eiken has received the payment due July 2021 mentioned above and all royalties accrued up to the termination date. Eiken may terminate the Eiken Agreement upon (1) not receiving any royalties on Licensed Products for a certain period of time after we commence sale of such Licensed Product, (2) a breach by us or our affiliates that is not cured within a certain number of days after receiving written notice of the breach, (3) our bankruptcy or insolvency or certain other bankruptcy or insolvency events, (4) the assignment or attempt to assign the Eiken Agreement by us in violation of the Eiken Agreement or (5) a challenge by us or our affiliates of the validity of any of the Eiken Licensed Patents. 
 Government Regulation 
 Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States 
 Our product candidates and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as the FDCA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. 
 The FDA regulates the development, design, pre-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a

device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending premarket applications, issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, or grant of a de novo request for classification. During public emergencies, FDA also may grant emergency use authorizations to allow commercial distribution of devices intended to address the public health emergency. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. 
 Class I devices include those with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions through the submission of Medical Device Reports, or MDRs, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I or low risk devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. 
 Class II devices are moderate risk devices subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, or 510(k), submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarketing requirements. 
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device following a 510(k) submission. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a PMA application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless an exemption applies, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective for its intended use and must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA also has the authority to allow the commercialization of unapproved medical devices, or new uses of existing devices in times of emergency, such as during a pandemic. 
 Emergency Use Authorization 
 In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, the FDA has the authority to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. 
 35


Under this authority, the FDA may issue an EUA for an unapproved device if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence of effectiveness of the device exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. Evidence of effectiveness includes medical devices that “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose, or treat the disease or condition identified in a declaration of emergency issued by the Secretary of HHS. The “may be effective” standard for EUAs requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that FDA uses for product clearances or approvals in non-emergency situations. The FDA assesses the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis. In determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, the FDA examines the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to) results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence. 
 Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product. 
 The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety. 
 On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represents a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and, subsequently, declared on March 24, 2020, that circumstances exist to justify the authorization of emergency use of medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. On February 29, 2020, the FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance with policy specific to development of in vitro diagnostic tests during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This guidance was updated on March 16, 2020, May 4, 2020 and May 11, 2020. We received an EUA from the FDA for our COVID-19 test kit on November 17, 2020 and submitted EUA applications to the FDA for the expansion of our current EUA to include asymptomatic individuals and OTC use in February 2021.
 510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway 
 Our current products are class II and, but for the immediate ability to seek an EUA, would be subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (a pre-amendment device), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (1) the same technological characteristics, or (2i) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 calendar days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often takes longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2020, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $11,594. 
 Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) 
 36


submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information within 180 days before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. 
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn. 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) submission is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. The FDA requested public feedback on whether it should consider certain actions that might require new authority, such as whether to sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. 
 PMA Approval Pathway 
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is reasonably safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take and often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and 
 37


evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. 
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical trial that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical trials post-approval. The FDA may also condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. 
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. None of our test kits are currently approved under a PMA, nor are we currently seeking approval under a PMA for our COVID-19 test kit. However, we may in the future develop devices which will require the approval of a PMA. 
 De novo Classification 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To market low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo down-classification. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. A medical device may be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent or a manufacturer may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 calendar days following receipt of the de novo application, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. During the pendency of the FDA’s review, the FDA may issue an additional information letter, which places the de novo request on hold and stops the review clock pending receipt of the additional information requested. In the event the de novo requestor does not provide the requested information within 180 calendar days, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request for classification if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. In the event the FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type, through a 510(k) premarket notification. 
 38


Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA, oftentimes for a de novo request for classification, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, purported or represented to be used in supporting or sustaining human life, is for a use that is substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A clinical trial may begin 30 days after receipt of the IDE by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will approve the IDE and, if it is approved, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. 
 In addition, the clinical trials must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. 
 If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements also apply to non-significant risk device studies. 
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical trial are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all applicable reporting and record keeping requirements. 
 Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. 
 39


Post-market Regulation 
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections, product removals or recalls if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In general, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. 
 Manufacturing processes for commercial products are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, design history file, device history records, and complaint files. As manufacturers, we and our contract manufacturers, such as Jabil, will be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products, which would harm our business. The discovery of previously unknown 
 40


problems with any of our test kits, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: 
  
• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | recall, withdrawal, administrative detention or seizure of our test kits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new test kits or modified test kits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval for our test kits; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Healthcare Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HIPAA, among other things, established federal protection for the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. Under HIPAA, the HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of PHI used or disclosed by “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and certain healthcare providers. The HIPAA privacy regulations protect PHI by limiting its use and disclosure, giving patients the right to access certain information about them, and limiting most disclosures of PHI to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. In addition, HIPAA requires covered entities to execute business associate agreements with their business associates and subcontractors, who provide services for or on behalf of covered entities. Business associates have a corresponding obligation to maintain appropriate business associate agreements with downstream subcontractors under HIPAA. 
 In addition, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy and security laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. For 
 41


example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely, and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. 
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, Healthcare Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 or their implementing regulations, and similar state laws, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HIPAA has four tiers of civil monetary penalties, as well as criminal penalties, both of which may be applied to business associates as well as covered entities, and state attorneys have authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. State privacy and security laws also may include penalties for noncompliance, as well as a private right of action. 
 U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 The U.S. federal and state governments have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to address fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. 
 Anti-Kickback Statutes 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order, arrangement for, or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. 
 The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. The government takes the position, and courts have agreed with the government’s interpretation, that the statute’s intent requirement is satisfied if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, even if there are other legitimate purposes. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal penalties and fines, imprisonment of up to ten years, civil and administrative penalties for each violation, damages, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs like Medicare or Medicaid. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, discussed in greater detail below. 
 There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors” protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance to offer protection. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the HHS, Office of the Inspector General, or the OIG. 
 42


Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare products or services reimbursed by any source, not only government healthcare programs, and may apply to payments made directly by the patient. 
 Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. 
 Federal False Claims Laws 
 The FCA prohibits any person or entity, among other things, to knowingly present, or cause to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The qui tam provisions of the FCA allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not only a federal healthcare program. 
 When an entity is found to have violated the FCA, it may be required to pay treble damages and significant mandatory penalties, civil monetary penalties, and may be subject to exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many medical device manufacturers and healthcare companies have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government for a variety of alleged improper activities and have entered into corporate integrity agreements with OIG, under which the companies undertake certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, to avoid exclusion from federal health care program. The federal government has used the FCA to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks, or in instances in which manufacturers have provided billing or coding advice to providers that the government considered to be inaccurate. In these cases, the manufacturer is subject to liability for “causing” a false claim. In addition, the federal government has pursued companies under the FCA in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our activities, including those relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our test kits (once approved) and the sale and marketing of our test kits (once approved), may be subject to scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA. We are also subject to other criminal federal laws that prohibit making false or fictitious claims and false statements to the federal government. 
 While we are unaware of any current investigations or allegations for violations of anti-kickback or false claims laws, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the FCA or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, even if successful or if any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our business as well as our financial performance. 
 HIPAA Fraud Statute 
 HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.

Open Payments 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians, and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information and transfers of value provided (beginning in 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. Failure to submit timely, accurate and complete reports may result in substantial monetary penalties. We are subject to the Open Payments Program and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring them to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
 Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs. Available to people age 65 or over, and certain other people, Medicare provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such people, subject to certain deductibles and copayments. 
 CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. The reimbursement rate for certain services, including clinical laboratory services, is established under fee schedules that are developed and periodically updated pursuant to specific statutory or regulatory provisions. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations and policy affecting CMS coverage and reimbursement relative to the procedure using our test kits (once approved) could have a material effect on our performance. 
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy people. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement vary from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. Changes to the availability of coverage, method or level of reimbursement for relevant procedures may affect future revenue negatively if reimbursement amounts are decreased or discontinued. 
 All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers.

U.S. Health Reform 
 Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products once approved. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our test kits profitably once approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our test kits once approved. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our test kits once approved. 
 The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the United States that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019, and was permanently repealed on December 20, 2019 by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. The Affordable Care Act also implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Further, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the aforementioned medical device tax, and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court in Texas ruled that the individual mandate, without the penalty that was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is unconstitutional and cannot be severed from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act, rendering the entire Act invalid. The Supreme Court of the United States is currently reviewing the case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The CARES Act and other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs and potentially affect individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could harm our business and financial condition.
