ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Business Development
    Red Trail Energy, LLC was formed as a North Dakota limited liability company in July of 2003, for the purpose of constructing, owning, and operating a fuel-grade ethanol plant near Richardton, North Dakota in western North Dakota. References to "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Red Trail Energy, LLC. We began production in January 2007.
On April 8, 2023, we entered into a revolving promissory note for a $10 million loan with our primary lender, Cornerstone Bank. The promissory note has a maturity date of April 5, 2024. Interest accrues on any outstanding balance on the promissory note at a rate of 1.0% less than the prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal, adjusted monthly. The revolving loan has a minimum interest rate of 5.0%.
On April 24, 2023, we named Jodi Johnson as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Joni Entze as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Jodi Johnson previously served as the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Gerald Bachmeier who served as CEO until April 24, 2023, continued to serve as a consultant for the Company until September 30, 2023.
Principal Products 

    The principal products that we produce are ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our primary products for each of our last three fiscal years.

Product | Fiscal Year 2023 | | Fiscal Year 2022 | | Fiscal Year 2021
Ethanol | 76.0 | % | | 77.2 | % | 76.9 | %
Distillers Grains | 18.2 | % | | 16.4 | % | 17.8 | %
Corn Oil | 5.5 | % | | 5.7 | % | 4.4 | %

Ethanol
Our primary product is ethanol which we manufacture from corn. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Although the ethanol industry continues to explore production technologies employing various feedstocks, such as biomass, our management believes corn-based production technologies remain the most practical and provide the lowest operating risks. Corn produces large quantities of carbohydrates, which convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass. 
Ethanol produced in the United States is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Ethanol blended fuel is typically designated in the marketplace according to the percentage of the fuel that is ethanol, with the most common fuel blend being E10, which contains 10% ethanol. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has approved the use of gasoline blends that contain 15% ethanol, or E15, for use in all vehicles manufactured in model year 2001 and later. In 2019, the EPA changed regulations which would allow E15 to be sold year-round in all markets in the United States, however, this rule was reversed by the federal courts. The EPA issued a temporary emergency waiver in the summer of 2022 which permitted the sale of E15 year-round. The EPA issued several temporary emergency waivers in the summer of 2023 that approved the use of E15 from May 1, 2023 through September 15, 2023 in response to industry disruptions due to the war in Ukraine. The EPA is expected to issue a new rule approving the use of E15 year-round in eight Midwestern states. In addition, flexible fuel vehicles can use gasoline blends that contain up to 85% ethanol called E85. 
Distillers Grains
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, beef, poultry, and swine industries. We produce two forms of distillers grains: distillers dried grains and modified distillers grains. Modified distillers grains is processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture which has a shelf life of approximately seven days and is often sold to nearby markets. Distillers dried grains is processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% moisture. It has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market regardless of its vicinity to our ethanol plant. 
Corn Oil
    In March 2012, we commenced operating our corn oil extraction equipment to separate corn oil contained in our distillers grains for sale. The corn oil that we are capable of producing is not food grade corn-oil and it cannot be used for human consumption. The primary uses of the corn oil that we produce are for animal feed, industrial uses, and biodiesel production.
Principal Product Markets
We market nearly all of our products through a professional third party marketer, RPMG, Inc. ("RPMG"). The only products we sell which are not marketed by RPMG are E85 and E30 and certain modified distillers grains which we market internally to local customers. RPMG is a subsidiary of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC ("RPMG, LLC"). We are a part owner of RPMG, LLC which allows us to realize favorable marketing fees for our products and allows us to share in the profits generated by RPMG, LLC. Our ownership interest in RPMG, LLC also entitles us to a seat on its board of directors which is filled by Jodi Johnson, our Chief Executive Officer.  Except for the modified distillers grains and E85/E30 we market locally, RPMG decides where our products are marketed and sold. 
Our products are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as domestic production of ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil continue to expand, we anticipate increased international sales of our products. Exports of ethanol were higher for 2022 but were lower in 2023. Tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States have reduced export demand from those countries. Tariffs imposed by China remained unchanged during the past year. In March 2022, Brazil suspended its tariff through the end of the year on ethanol imported from the United States following a 10% reduction on the tariff in November 2021. However, in February 2023, Brazil reinstated tariffs on American ethanol of 16% for 2023 which will increase to 18% in 2024. Trade barriers with key markets may continue to take a toll on ethanol export demand which could negatively affect domestic ethanol prices. 
Exports of distillers grains increased in 2022 with the United States exporting about a third of distillers grain produced. The export market has remained strong in 2023 with Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia continuing as top destinations for distillers grains exports. Turkey and Canada imported sizeable volumes of distillers grains as well. Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers grains to China. The imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by China over the past seven years effectively closed the Chinese market. 
    We expect our product marketer to explore all markets for our products, including export markets. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 
Distribution Methods
    Our ethanol plant is located near Richardton, North Dakota in Stark County, in the western half of North Dakota. We selected the Richardton site because of its proximity to existing coal supplies, the initial fuel source for our ethanol plant, and accessibility to road and rail transportation. Our plant is served by the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.

    We sell and market the ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil produced at the plant through normal and established markets, including local, regional, and national markets. Our products are primarily shipped by rail and by truck in our local market. We have separate marketing agreements with RPMG for our ethanol, industrial ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil. Whether or not our products are sold in local markets will depend on decisions made by RPMG, except for the E85/E30 and the modified distillers grains which we internally market locally. Local markets are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Ethanol

    We have an exclusive marketing agreement with RPMG for the purposes of marketing and distributing all of the ethanol we produce at the ethanol plant. Because we are an owner of RPMG, LLC, our marketing fees are based on RPMG's actual cost to market our ethanol. Our ethanol marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at a fixed price agreed to between us and RPMG. The term of our ethanol marketing agreement is perpetual, until it is terminated according to the terms of the agreement. The primary reasons the ethanol marketing agreement would terminate are if we cease to be an owner of RPMG, LLC, if there is a breach of the agreement which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we would like to terminate the agreement. Notwithstanding our right to terminate the ethanol marketing agreement, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after the termination. Further, if the agreement is terminated, following the termination, we have agreed to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service us. If the ethanol marketing agreement is terminated, it would automatically trigger a redemption of our ownership interest in RPMG, LLC.
Distillers Grains

    On August 29, 2013, we executed a distillers grain marketing agreement with RPMG which started on October 1, 2013. Pursuant to the marketing agreement, RPMG markets all of the dried distillers grains we produce and we continue to internally market our modified distillers grains. Due to the fact that we are a part owner of RPMG, LLC, RPMG will only charge us its actual cost of marketing our distillers grains to its customers.  The initial term of the marketing agreement was one year and thereafter the agreement renews for additional one year periods unless we elect not to renew the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by either party based on certain events described in the agreement or based on the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party. 
    We market and sell our modified distillers grains internally.  Substantially all of our sales of modified distillers grains are to local farmers and feed lots.
Corn Oil
    In March 2012, we executed a corn oil marketing agreement with RPMG to sell all of the corn oil that we produce. We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of corn oil that RPMG sells on our behalf. The initial term of the corn oil marketing agreement was one year and the agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives notice that it will not extend the agreement past the current term.
New Products and Services
    We started capturing carbon dioxide during our 2022 fiscal year. During our 2023 fiscal year, we were able to monetize the carbon capture program through the sale of carbon tons and tax credits. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
Corn
Our ethanol plant used approximately 22.3 million bushels of corn during our 2023 fiscal year, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. Our commodity manager is responsible for purchasing corn for our operations, scheduling corn deliveries, and establishing hedging positions to protect the price we pay for corn. 
    During our 2023 fiscal year, we were able to secure sufficient corn to operate the plant at capacity. We do not anticipate any problems securing enough corn during our 2024 fiscal year. Almost all of our corn is supplied from farmers and local grain elevators in North Dakota and South Dakota. During our 2023 fiscal year, corn prices were lower than prior years, mainly due to increased corn supply. On September 12, 2023, the USDA released a report estimating the 2023 corn crop in the United States at approximately 15.1 billion bushels, up 10% from last year's production, with yields averaging 173.8 bushels per acre. The USDA forecasted area harvested for corn at 94.9 million acres, up 1% from 2022. We have not had difficulty securing the corn we require for our operations and we anticipate that we will be able to secure the corn we need to operate the ethanol plant during our 2024 fiscal year, although potentially at a higher price. While we do not anticipate encountering problems sourcing corn, a shortage of corn could develop, particularly if we experience an extended drought or other production problems during our 2024 fiscal year.  Poor weather can be a major factor in increasing corn prices, including the drought experienced during our 2023 fiscal year.  If the United States were to endure an entire growing season with poor weather conditions, it could result in a prolonged period of higher than normal corn prices.  
    Corn prices are also impacted by world supply and demand, the price of other commodities, current and anticipated stocks, domestic and export prices and supports, and the government's current and anticipated agricultural policy.  Corn prices have been volatile in the past and volatility could return to the market in the future. 
Natural Gas
    We use natural gas as the fuel source to power our ethanol plant. We are using natural gas to produce process steam and to dry our distillers grains products. Due to our close proximity to the Bakken oil field which produces a significant amount of natural gas, we anticipate that natural gas prices in our area will remain lower and the cost to transport the natural gas to our ethanol plant will be low compared to our competitors. We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Rainbow Gas Company which provides a supply of natural gas to the ethanol plant. We do not anticipate any difficulty securing the natural gas we require to operate the ethanol plant.
Electricity

    The production of ethanol uses significant amounts of electricity. We entered into a contract with Roughrider Electric Cooperative to provide our needed electrical energy. This contract was renewed in August 2019. This contract automatically renews unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew the agreement.
Water
    To meet the plant's water requirements, we entered into a ten-year contract with Southwest Water Authority to purchase raw water. Our contract requires us to purchase a minimum of 160 million gallons of water per year. We anticipate receiving adequate water supplies during our 2024 fiscal year.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
    We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises, or concessions. We were granted a perpetual and royalty free license by ICM, Inc. ("ICM") to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build the plant. 
Seasonality of Sales
    We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the number of animals at feed lots and during times when cattle are turned out to pasture. Finally, corn oil is used for biodiesel production which typically decreases in the winter months due to decreased biodiesel demand. 
Working Capital
    We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate our ethanol plant and for capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade the plant. During our 2023 fiscal year, our primary sources of working capital were cash from our operations as well as our revolving loan with Cornerstone Bank. 
Dependence on a Few Major Customers
    As discussed above, we rely on RPMG for the sale and distribution of all of our ethanol, dried distillers grains and corn oil. Accordingly, we are highly dependent on RPMG for the successful marketing of most of our products. We anticipate that we would be able to secure alternate marketers should RPMG fail, however, a loss of our relationship with RPMG could significantly harm our financial performance.
Competition
We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of which have greater resources than we have. Larger ethanol producers may be able to take advantage of economies of scale due to their larger size and increased bargaining 
power with both customers and raw material suppliers. As of November 21, 2023, the Renewable Fuels Association ("RFA") estimates that there are approximately 197 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 17,787 million gallons of ethanol annually, with additional ethanol production facilities under production that have an estimated total capacity to produce 89 million gallons of ethanol annually. In the past, the ethanol industry experienced consolidation where a few larger ethanol producers emerged who control a large portion of United States ethanol production. The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET, and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which is capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. Collectively this group controls approximately 40.5% of the ethanol production capacity in the United States. 
The following table identifies the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities. 
U.S. FUEL ETHANOL PRODUCTION CAPACITY BY TOP PRODUCERS
Producers of Approximately 900 million gallons per year or more

Company | Current Capacity(MMgy) | Percent of Total Industry Capacity
POET Biorefining | 3,005 | | 16.9 | %
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,625 | | 9.1 | %
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,613 | | 9 | %
Green Plains Renewable Energy | 958 | | 5.4 | %
TOTAL | 7,201 | | 40.5 | %

Ethanol Competition
Ethanol is a commodity product where competition in the industry is predominantly based on price and consistent fuel quality. Further, some oil companies have purchased ethanol production facilities, including Valero Renewable Fuels, which is a subsidiary of a larger energy company. Oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate our ethanol plant. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. This added flexibility may allow these ethanol producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. Finally some ethanol producers who own ethanol plants in geographically diverse areas of the United States may spread the risk they encounter related to feedstock prices due to localized decreased corn production and supplies. 
    We anticipate competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock that is being explored is cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, and rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn-based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
    A number of automotive, industrial, and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars, or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While in the past there were a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations which have made electric car technology more widely available. Additional competition from these other sources of alternative energy, particularly in the automobile market, could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
In addition to domestic producers of ethanol, we face competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries, particularly Brazil. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years and ethanol exports have been higher which was one of the reasons for improved operating margins in the ethanol industry. As of May 1, 2013, Brazil increased its domestic ethanol use requirement from 20% to 25% which decreased the amount of ethanol available in Brazil for export. In addition, Brazil instituted a tariff on ethanol produced in the United States which has resulted in less ethanol exports to Brazil. In the future, we may experience increased ethanol imports from Brazil which could put negative pressure on domestic ethanol prices and result 
in excess ethanol supply in the United States. However, as of 2023, Brazil is considering legislation which would require an ethanol-gasoline blend of 30%, an increase of 2.5% over the current blend requirement. We continue to look for opportunities to export ethanol to other countries and open new markets for ethanol produced in the United States. 
    Competition among ethanol producers may continue to increase as gasoline demand decreases due to more fuel efficient vehicles being produced. If the concentration of ethanol used in most gasoline does not increase and gasoline demand is lower due to increased fuel efficiency by the vehicles operated in the United States, competition may increase among ethanol producers to supply the ethanol market.
    Finally, many ethanol producers increased their production capacities through expansion projects which started becoming operational during our 2018 fiscal year. These expansion projects have increased the supply of ethanol in the market, negatively impacted market ethanol prices and may result in excess ethanol supply in the future. During our 2019 fiscal year, many ethanol producers reduced production or ceased production altogether due to unfavorable operating margins which somewhat offset the additional ethanol production from the 2018 expansion projects. During 2020, the ethanol industry was impacted by decreased gasoline and ethanol demand because of social distancing restrictions implemented because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During our 2021 fiscal year, ethanol demand increased and we experienced much more favorable financial margins. During our 2022 fiscal year, ethanol prices increased, particularly during our first fiscal quarter of 2022, and we experienced favorable financial margins. During our 2023 fiscal year, ethanol prices were down slightly, and we experienced less favorable financial margins compared to our 2022 fiscal year. 
Distillers Grains Competition
    Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Distillers grains are primarily used as an animal feed which replaces corn and soybean meal. As a result, we believe that distillers grains prices are positively impacted by increases in corn and soybean prices. In addition, in recent years the United States ethanol industry has increased exports of distillers grains which management believes has positively impacted demand and prices for distillers grains in the United States. In the event these distillers grains exports decrease, it could lead to an oversupply of distillers grains in the United States which could result in increased competition among ethanol producers for sales of distillers grains and could negatively impact distillers grains prices in the United States.
In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine and poultry markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from it. The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with four other feed formulations: soybean meal, corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Soybean meal, dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Recently, additional soybean crushing facilities are being constructed which may increase the supply of soybean meal in the market. It is anticipated that soybean crush capacity may increase by 30% from 2023 to 2026. This increase in soybean meal could negatively impact the market price of distillers grains. 
Corn Oil Competition
    We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and at times has resulted in lower market corn oil prices. In recent years, corn oil prices and demand have been higher due to commodity prices generally and increased demand for corn oil from the biodiesel and renewable diesel industries. Corn oil demand is projected to increase over the next six years. However, it is not guaranteed that such demand will increase, or that we will be able to take advantage of any increased demand. 
Governmental Regulation and Federal Ethanol Supports
Federal Ethanol Supports
    The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol. One significant federal ethanol support is the ethanol use requirement in the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the "RFS"). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not 
require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increased incrementally each year until the United States was required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain "advanced" renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
    Prior to 2023, the EPA had the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Annually, the EPA was required to pass a rule that established the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations ("RVO"). Now the EPA has authority to propose the RFS annually as the law creating the RFS only set the statutory volume requirement through 2022.
    The statutory RVO for all renewable fuels for 2018 was 19.29 billion gallons, of which corn-based ethanol could meet 15 billion gallons of the RVO. On November 30, 2018, the final RVO for 2019 was set at 19.92 billion gallons and the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. On December 7, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed RVO rule which set the 2022 RVO at 15 billion gallons for corn-based ethanol, set the 2021 RVO for corn-based ethanol at 13.3 billion gallons, less than the statutory requirement in the RFS of 15 billion gallons. The December 7, 2021 proposed rule also proposed to reopen the 2020 RVO which was previously set at 15 billion gallons for corn-based ethanol and retroactively reduce that amount to 12.5 billion gallons. On June 21, 2023, the EPA issued final RVO rules, which for 2023 is set at 20.94 billion gallons, for 2024 is set at 21.54 billion gallons, and for 2025 is set at 22.33 billion gallons. For 2023, 2024, and 2025, the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. 
During 2019 it came to light that the EPA was issuing waivers of the RVO obligations for certain small refineries. These small refinery waivers resulted in significant decreases in ethanol demand during 2018 and 2019 which were below the RVO requirements. Many in the ethanol industry believe these waivers did not meet the standards set out in the RFS. The ethanol industry has been pushing the EPA to reverse the effects of these small refinery waivers which we believe contributed to poor operating margins starting in 2018 and continuing through our 2020 fiscal year. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision finding that a small refinery may obtain a hardship exemption even if its earlier exemption had lapsed in one or more previous years. In June 2022, the EPA announced the denial of 69 small refinery exemption petitions for one or more compliance years between 2016 and 2021 on the grounds that the petitioners had failed to show that the EPA had a basis to approve them. In July 2023, the EPA further announced the denial of 26 small refinery exemption petitions for one or more of the compliance years between 2016 and 2023 on similar grounds. 
 In June 2012, the EPA gave final approval for the sale of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for use in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. Although there have been significant steps towards introduction of E15 in the marketplace, there are still obstacles to meaningful market penetration by E15. Many states still have regulatory issues that hamper or prevent the sale of E15. In addition, sales of E15 may be limited because E15 is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. Previously, different gasoline blendstocks were required at certain times of the year due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which prevented E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. In May 2019, the EPA issued a final rule allowing the year-round sale of E15. However in June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down this rule finding that the EPA exceeded its authority. In May 2022, the EPA issued an emergency waiver to allow sales of E15 during the summer months. The reason given for the temporary suspension of the prohibition on year-round sales was that it was an effort to counteract rising gasoline prices. The EPA is currently considering finalizing a change to allow E15 to be available year round and legislation has been proposed to allow E15 to be used year round. However, it is unclear whether that will occur without an annual waiver.
 A blender pump is a gasoline pump that can dispense a variety of different ethanol/gasoline blends. Blender pumps typically can dispense E10, E20, E30, E40, E50 and E85. These blender pumps accomplish these different ethanol/gasoline blends by internally mixing ethanol and gasoline which are held in separate tanks at the retail gas stations. Many in the ethanol industry believe that increased use of blender pumps will increase demand for ethanol by allowing gasoline retailers to provide various mid-level ethanol blends in a cost effective manner and allowing consumers with flex-fuel vehicles to purchase more 
ethanol through these mid-level blends. However, the expense of blender pumps has delayed their availability in the retail gasoline market. 
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which has several provisions that may benefit the ethanol industry, was signed into law. There is, however, considerable uncertainty as to how the newly required provisions will be implemented in future regulatory guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act maintains the 12-year credit period for the existing Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage ("CCS"). However, the Act extends eligibility for the credit to facilities that have commenced construction by December 31, 2032, and substantially lowers the minimum annual capture requirements to 12,500 tons for qualifying facilities. In addition, the potential credit rate is increased five times for industrial facilities and power plants that capture their carbon emissions to $85 per metric ton of carbon oxide stored in secure geologic formations, $60 per ton for the beneficial utilization of captured carbon emissions, and $60 per ton for carbon oxide stored in oil and gas fields. We will receive $50 per metric ton for our stored carbon dioxide because we placed our sequestration equipment in service before January 1, 2024. Prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements must be met by the facility to claim the full amount of the higher credit. On August 29, 2023, the Treasury issued proposed regulations providing guidance on when and how to satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Comments were due to the Treasury by October 29, 2023. Final regulations have yet to be established. In addition, projects will now be eligible to be directly paid for the credit by the Internal Revenue Service for the first five years with no direct pay for many projects for the final seven years of the credit, and, as an alternative to direct pay, projects will now be allowed to sell their credits to unrelated third parties for cash without adverse tax consequences.
The Inflation Reduction Act also creates a Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for the production of low-emissions transportation fuel produced and sold in 2025, 2026, and 2027, subject to certain requirements as to prevailing wage and apprenticeship. Except as to certain tax-exempt entities, this credit is not eligible for direct pay but may be sold or transferred in most circumstances. The Act provides that the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit is not available for a facility that qualifies for the Section 45Q tax credit. Additional incentives for production of sustainable aviation fuel and $500 million in funding for biofuels infrastructure funding are also included in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Effect of Governmental Regulation
The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water, and other environmental regulations, and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the ethanol plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the ethanol plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions effecting our operations, cash flows, and financial performance. 
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the ethanol plant. During our 2023 fiscal year, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $302,000 complying with environmental laws, including the cost of obtaining permits. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. Management believes converting the plant to use natural gas as the fuel source instead of coal has reduced our environmental compliance costs.
    In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.
    In August 2017, Brazil instituted an import quota for ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil, along with a 20% tariff on ethanol imports in excess of the quota. In September 2019, the Brazilians increased the tariff free import quota from 600 million liters to 750 million liters. In December 2020, the tariff free quota was revoked. In March 2022, this tariff was suspended through December 2022. This tariff and quota have reduced exports of ethanol to Brazil and may continue to negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. Any reduction in ethanol exports could negatively impact market ethanol prices in the United States. In addition, the Chinese government increased the tariff on United States ethanol imports into China from 30% to 45% and subsequently to 70%. In 2020, this tariff was again reduced to 45%. Due to other recent tariff activity between the United States and China, management does not expect these Chinese tariffs to be removed in 
the near term, despite recent positive discussions. Both China and Brazil have been major sources of import demand for United States ethanol and distillers grains. These trade actions may result in negative operating margins for United States ethanol producers.
Employees
As of December 29, 2023, we had 49 full-time employees. We anticipate that we will have approximately 49 full-time employees during the next 12 months.
