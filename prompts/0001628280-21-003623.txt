Item 1. Business
Overview
Adverum is a clinical-stage gene therapy company targeting unmet medical needs in ocular and rare diseases. We develop gene therapy product candidates intended to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. Our core capabilities include novel vector discovery, preclinical and clinical development, and pre-commercial planning. In addition, we have in-house manufacturing expertise, specifically in scalable process development, assay development, and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) quality control, and have leased and are building out a GMP commercial manufacturing facility to support our commercial plans for our lead product candidate, ADVM-022. We believe ADVM-022 has the potential to be the first mass-marketed gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration (“wet AMD”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”).
ADVM-022 is a single, in-office intravitreal (“IVT”) injection gene therapy designed to deliver long-term durability with robust treatment response, reduce the treatment burden of frequent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (“anti-VEGF”) injections, and improve real-world vision outcomes for patients. ADVM-022 is being developed for the treatment of patients with chronic retinal diseases who respond to standard-of-care anti-VEGF therapy, including wet AMD and DME. ADVM-022 utilizes a proprietary vector capsid, AAV.7m8, carrying an aflibercept coding sequence under the control of a proprietary expression cassette.
Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in patients over 65 years of age, with a prevalence of approximately 1.5 million individuals in the U.S. (with approximately 200,000 new diagnoses per year) and over 5 million individuals worldwide. In recognition of the need for new treatment options for wet AMD, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Fast Track designation for ADVM-022 for the treatment of wet AMD. 
We are conducting the OPTIC trial, designed as a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, dose-ranging safety trial of ADVM-022 in patients with wet AMD who have demonstrated responsiveness to anti-VEGF treatment. Patients in OPTIC are treatment experienced, and previously required frequent anti-VEGF injections to control their wet AMD and to maintain functional vision. We completed enrollment for OPTIC in July 2020 and expect to present updated data from OPTIC in the second quarter of 2021.
Diabetes impacts over 400 million people globally, including 30 million people in the United States, and is increasing in prevalence. Approximately 5% of adults with diabetes are impacted by DME, a vision-threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy (“DR”), the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. 
We are conducting the INFINITY trial, a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, active comparator-controlled study evaluating a single IVT injection of ADVM-022 in patients with DME. The INFINITY trial is designed to demonstrate superior control of disease activity following a single IVT injection of ADVM-022 compared to a single aflibercept injection, as measured by time to worsening of DME disease activity in the study eye. Additional objectives include assessments of treatment burden, visual acuity, retinal anatomy and safety outcomes. We have completed patient enrollment, and we plan to present clinical data in the second half of 2021.
Based on the promising data observed in OPTIC to date and our discussions with the FDA, we believe we have reached alignment on our clinical development and CMC requirements. We anticipate initiating two global Phase 3 trials for ADVM-022 in wet AMD in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, we believe that approximately 6% of patients with wet AMD are treated bilaterally from time of diagnosis and this grows to almost one-third within four years. We plan to evaluate the potential for bilateral treatment with ADVM-022 in order to include data on bilateral administration in our Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for the wet AMD indication. With this approach, we are targeting submitting this BLA in 2024. As we advance ADVM-022 for these two large ocular disease indications, we are continuing to develop our manufacturing expertise to support the potential future commercial product launch. In addition, we are planning for in-house manufacturing capabilities, including building out our new GMP manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina. This new 174,000 square foot facility will be dedicated to providing commercial supply, if ADVM-022 is approved for marketing, while we will continue to leverage our contract manufacturing organization partnerships for clinical and additional commercial supply. We expect our GMP manufacturing facility will be production-ready by the end of 2023.
Impact of COVID-19
Our results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact these areas in the future is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments that are unpredictable. We are actively monitoring and managing our response and assessing actual and potential impacts to these areas. Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section for further discussion of the risks we face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impact on Operations
We are continuously evaluating and addressing potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations. To date, we have experienced limited impact due to COVID-19 on our operations. Our offices, laboratories, clinical trial sites, contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract manufacturing organizations, and other collaborators and partners are located in jurisdictions where quarantines, executive orders, shelter-in-place orders, guidelines, and other similar orders and restrictions intended to control the spread of the disease have been put in place by governmental authorities. 
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees and their families and doing our part to slow the community spread of COVID-19. In mid-March, we implemented a number of actions, including a work-from-home policy for employees whose jobs do not require them to be onsite, allowing for flexible work schedules, restricting in-person meetings, and limiting onsite activities to only the most time-critical or necessary operational activities. We have maintained certain essential in-person laboratory functions in order to advance key research and development initiatives, supported by the implementation of updated onsite procedures. We believe these measures and others have allowed us to mitigate, but not eliminate, the effects and risks on our on-site operations posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Impact on Clinical Trials
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing and planned clinical trials is uncertain and subject to change. To date, we believe we have experienced limited impact due to COVID-19 on our ongoing clinical programs, including the OPTIC and INFINITY clinical trials. We are working closely with our clinical trial sites to monitor and attempt to address or limit the potential negative impacts of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on patient safety, continued participation of patients already enrolled in our clinical studies, protocol compliance, data quality, and overall study integrity. Despite these efforts, we are unsure as to whether the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly impact future trial enrollment or completion of our current or planned clinical studies. 
Impact on Supply Chain and Manufacturing
While we have not yet experienced significant disruptions to our supply chain and manufacturing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot be certain that this trend will continue. Based on current information, we believe that our partners in our supply chain have been and will continue to serve us continuously during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, certain of these partners including our bulk drug substance and drug product suppliers have prioritized and allocated more resources and capacity to supply drug product or raw materials to other companies engaged in the study and/or supply of potential treatments or vaccinations for COVID-19, which could result in supply interruptions for us. To mitigate against future potential delays in product supply, we are continuously implementing additional measures to address potential risks as we identify them, including securing additional supplies and manufacturing capacity reserve, which have resulted in additional expenses and may result in other additional expenses in the future.
Our Strengths
We believe we have the capabilities, resources, and expertise to enable Adverum to become a leading gene therapy company. These strengths include:
•industry-leading development capabilities in adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) technology;
•a pipeline of gene therapy product candidates targeting the treatment of ocular and rare diseases;
•in-house manufacturing expertise, specifically in scalable process development, assay development, and GMP quality control; 
•a GMP commercial manufacturing facility that is currently being built out;
•a growing portfolio of proprietary vectors;
•a robust patent portfolio; and
•an experienced leadership team with expertise in ophthalmology, gene therapy, and drug development.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to discover, develop, and commercialize novel gene therapies with the potential to treat patients living with ocular and rare diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:
•Target large patient populations impacted by wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy (including diabetic macular edema), and other chronic retinal conditions that respond to anti-VEGF therapy. There are an estimated 1.5 million individuals in the U.S. and over 5 million individuals worldwide living with wet AMD, and the incidence of new cases is expected to continue to grow significantly as the population ages. There are an estimated 30 million individuals in the U.S. impacted by diabetes, approximately 5% of whom are living with DME, and the incidence is expected to continue to grow significantly with the prevalence of diabetes. DME is a type of diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults. We estimate that the standard-of-care anti-VEGF therapies used to treat wet AMD and DR generated in excess of $11 billion worldwide in sales in 2020 and that there are approximately 9 million patients with wet AMD and DME treatable with anti-VEGF therapy worldwide. 
•Develop a one-time gene therapy treatment to relieve the burden of frequent, chronic injections. Our gene therapies are designed as a single, in-office IVT injection therapy to address the unmet needs of patients with ocular and rare diseases. The current standards of care for wet AMD, DME, and other chronic diseases require frequent injections for the duration of the disease. As an example, for wet AMD, the current standard-of-care treatments require patients to receive IVT injections of anti-VEGF protein every 4-12 weeks. Similar regimens have been approved for DME. We believe that durable treatment to reduce injection frequency is the largest unmet need for wet AMD patients. Lifetime need for frequent injections burdens patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Real world evidence shows reduction in patients’ vision over time. A gene therapy administered as a single, in-office IVT injection has the potential to deliver long-term efficacy, reduce the burden of frequent anti-VEGF injections, optimize patient compliance, and improve vision outcomes for patients.
•Pursue indications with well-defined clinical and regulatory paths where possible, to mitigate the development risk. We have selected indications that have prior clinical validation, including established endpoints, standard-of-care administration methods, and defined regulatory paths. For example, for wet AMD, aflibercept is an approved standard-of-care IVT injection treatment, and ADVM‑022 utilizes our proprietary vector, AAV.7m8, designed to provide the same anti-VEGF protein through a single IVT injection.
•Developing our pipeline by advancing our earlier-stage research initiatives and leveraging our industry-leading capabilities in novel vector development. We leverage our next-generation AAV-based directed evolution platform to engineer AAV capsids with enhanced tropism for certain tissues and/or improved antibody neutralization profiles over existing AAV variants. Combining our AAV engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have the capability to generate high-quantity recombinant AAV capsid libraries that can be screened in large animals, rather than rodents, to maximize translatability of the resultant capsids to human subjects. We are also focused on discovering improved ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters and expression cassettes to offer optimal transgene expression in target tissues. We plan to use this expertise to expand our pipeline and manage the life cycle of our novel gene therapies.
•Collaborate with partners to leverage our industry-leading AAV vector expertise and ocular vector development and product delivery capabilities. We explore opportunities to work collaboratively with potential new partners that may benefit from our capabilities and expertise in AAV vector development and product delivery.
•Expand our process development capabilities to support late-stage clinical trials and commercialization. Our manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus/Sf9 production system, which has been used for a number of vaccines and recombinant protein therapies approved by the FDA and European Medical Agency (“EMA”), and is capable of producing large quantities of AAVs. Our strategy is to develop scalable processes to transfer to our new internal GMP manufacturing site in North Carolina and to our GMP contract manufacturers, providing a flexible manufacturing strategy to support a potentially global supply. 
Gene Therapy Background
Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality to address disease biology in a targeted and efficient way. With gene therapy, patients receive vectors encoding therapeutic genes, expressing a therapeutic protein or the functional version of a mutated protein. Instead of dosing patients with proteins or other therapies repeatedly over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once to achieve long-term, durable benefits. Once a patient’s cells are transduced with a gene, the cells are potentially able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years.
Similar to existing classes of protein or biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates, gene therapy has taken a number of years to evolve from a research tool into a viable and compelling treatment modality. There have been several recent advances in gene therapy, including the following:
•Substantial clinical data. Positive data from gene therapy clinical trials have been reported in a variety of indications, including hemophilia, spinal muscular atrophy, Sanfilippo syndrome, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type 1a, sickle cell disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as several ocular diseases including biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy, choroideremia, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, and X‑linked retinitis pigmentosa.
•Significant investment by biopharmaceutical companies. The modality of gene therapy has received significant interest and investments by biopharmaceutical companies. Large, global biopharmaceutical companies, such as Astellas Pharma Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Bristol-Myers Squib, CSL Behring, Daiichi Sankyo, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and Regeneron have increased their investment in the gene therapy field. Additionally, pure-play gene therapy companies, such as 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Akouos Therapeutics, Passage Bio, REGENXBIO Inc., Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Sangamo Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, Sio Gene Therapies, Solid Biosciences, Taysha Gene Therapies, and uniQure N.V. have attracted recent investment in this growing field.
•Approval of cell and gene therapy products by regulatory authorities. The FDA and EMA have approved several cell and gene therapy products, including two AAV vector-based gene therapy products. 
Our Novel AAV Vector Discovery and Optimization System
Our next-generation discovery platform is based on vectors derived from AAV, which is a small, non-pathogenic virus, which carry a therapeutic DNA instead of the viral genes. The resulting vector is used to deliver a gene into a desired cell population, which when expressed, can provide sustained protein production. We believe AAV vectors offer numerous advantages over other viral and non-viral vector technologies used for gene therapy. These advantages, highlighted below, have the potential to allow AAVs to be safe, to be applicable for a variety of indications, and to exhibit long-term efficacy.
•Highly-efficient transfer of DNA. AAV vectors offer highly-efficient transfer of DNA to the patient.
•Non-pathogenic. Naturally occurring and recombinant AAV are not known to cause disease in humans.
•Non-replicating. Naturally occurring AAV is incapable of replication without co-infection of a helper virus such as adenovirus, herpes virus, or others. Recombinant AAV vectors used in our product candidates lack additional genes making them even less capable of replication.
•Long-term expression. Once incorporated into the host cell, AAV vectors can continue to drive expression of a therapeutic protein for years, making AAV-based gene therapy a compelling treatment modality for diseases requiring frequent chronic treatment regimens.
•Low-integrating potential. Recombinant AAV vector genomes remain mainly as a stable non-integrating episomes, mitigating safety concerns associated with genomic integration.
•Low inflammatory potential. Compared to other vectors used in direct gene therapy approaches, AAV vectors elicit relatively mild inflammatory reactions.
•Ability to transduce non-dividing cells. AAV vectors can efficiently transduce non-dividing cells or slow-dividing cells such as retinal cells and hepatocytes, which allow production of the therapeutic protein at the site of the disease (wet AMD) or its natural organ of production (C1-Esterase Inhibitor).
•Approval of cell and gene therapy products by regulatory authorities. The FDA and EMA have approved two AAV vector-based gene therapy products.
AAV-derived vectors are a leading vector used in gene therapy. According to the Journal of Gene Medicine, AAV has been used in over 260 clinical trials as of January 2021. As effective as existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there are opportunities for improvement. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which remain and pose limitations to their use in gene therapy.
To create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. Our directed evolution technology uses a library of engineered AAV capsid genes, which exhibit different properties and capabilities than naturally occurring AAVs. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, we screen the AAVs in the pool for novel properties, e.g., specific transduction of a particular cell type, or the capability to evade pre-existing neutralizing immune response. Once capsids with desirable properties are identified, those capsids are screened to create a smaller pool of optimized vectors which are further screened until we have identified a select number of engineered AAVs with the characteristics we seek.
Our Product Candidates
We are advancing a pipeline of novel gene therapy product candidates designed to treat ocular and rare diseases. Our pipeline of programs is shown below.

Ocular Diseases
ADVM-022, Our Single Intravitreal Injection Gene Therapy Candidate for Treating Ocular Diseases
ADVM‑022 is our clinical-stage gene therapy product candidate being developed for the treatment of wet AMD and DME. ADVM-022 utilizes a propriety vector capsid, AAV.7m8, carrying an aflibercept coding sequence under the control of a proprietary expression cassette. ADVM-022 is administered as a one-time IVT injection and is designed to deliver long-term efficacy and reduce the burden of frequent anti-VEGF injections, optimize patient compliance, and improve vision outcomes for patients with wet AMD or DME.
The AAV.7m8 capsid was engineered from AAV2 by directed evolution to efficiently transduce retinal cells following intravitreal injection. The vector carries a vector genome (“vg”) encoding a codon-optimized cDNA of the aflibercept protein, a current standard of care in wet AMD, under the control of a strong, ubiquitous expression cassette.
We believe IVT injection of gene therapy offers substantial advantages compared to subretinal surgical administration of gene therapy, for the treatment of wet AMD and DME:
•IVT injection is a simple procedure performed during an office visit, and is the mode of administration for current standard-of-care therapies to treat patients with wet AMD and DME; and
•In comparison, a surgical setting is required for subretinal injections, with the attendant risks associated with intraocular surgery and vitrectomy.
ADVM‑022 for Treatment of Wet AMD
Market for Treating Patients with Wet AMD
Age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) is a progressive disease affecting the retinal cells in the macula, the region of the retina at the back of the eye responsible for central vision. Disease progression results in the death of retinal cells and the gradual loss of vision.
Wet AMD, also known as neovascular AMD or nAMD, is an advanced form of AMD, affecting approximately 10% of patients living with AMD. In patients with wet AMD, blood vessels begin to invade the space between layers of cells in the retina. These new blood vessels are often leaky, which results in fluid and blood in the retina and causes vision loss.
Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in patients over 65 years of age, with a prevalence of approximately 1.5 million individuals in the U.S. and over 5 million worldwide. The incidence of new cases of wet AMD in the U.S. is approximately 200,000 annually, and this number is expected to grow significantly as the country’s population ages.
The current standard-of-care therapy for wet AMD is chronic anti-VEGF IVT injections. These are effective but typically require eye injections every 4-12 weeks in order to maintain vision. Compliance with this regimen can be difficult for patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems, leading to undertreatment and resulting in loss of vision. We estimate that these standard-of-care therapies used for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion, and other ocular diseases generated in excess of $11 billion in sales worldwide in 2020 and that there are approximately 9 million patients with wet AMD and DME treatable with anti-VEGF therapy worldwide.
Advancing the Clinical Development of ADVM‑022 for Wet AMD
We initiated the ADVM‑022 phase 1 clinical trial entitled “An Open Label Phase 1 Study of ADVM 022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) in Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration – [OPTIC]” (“the OPTIC trial”) with the first patient dosed in November 2018. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for ADVM‑022 for wet AMD in September 2018.
The OPTIC trial is designed as a multi-center, open-label, phase 1, dose-ranging safety trial of ADVM-022 in patients with wet AMD who have demonstrated responsiveness to anti-VEGF treatment. Patients in OPTIC are treatment-experienced, and previously required frequent anti‑VEGF injections to control their wet AMD and to maintain functional vision.
In OPTIC, patients were dosed with a single IVT injection of ADVM-022. Patients in cohort 1 (n=6) were treated with a higher dose of ADVM-022 (6 x 10^11 vg/eye). Patients in cohort 2 (n=6) were treated with a three-fold lower dose of ADVM-022 (2 x 10^11 vg/eye). Patients in cohorts 1 and 2 received a 14-day tapering course of prophylactic oral steroids following ADVM-022 administration. Patients in cohort 3 (n=9) were treated with the lower dose of ADVM-022 (2 x 10^11 vg/eye), and patients in cohort 4 (n=9) were treated with the higher dose of ADVM-022 (6 x 10^11 vg/eye). Patients in cohorts 3 and 4 received a 6‑week tapering course of prophylactic topical steroids in place of the oral steroids.
The primary endpoint of the trial is the safety and tolerability of ADVM-022 after a single IVT administration. Secondary endpoints include changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), measurement of central subfield thickness (“CST”, a measure of retinal thickness), as well as mean number of anti-VEGF rescue injections and percentage of patients needing anti-VEGF rescue injections. Each patient enrolled will be followed for a total of two years.
*Subjects received prophylaxis of 60mg oral prednisone for 6 days starting at Day –3 followed by 7-day taper. **Subjects receive prophylaxis of QID difluprednate eye drops for 3 weeks starting at Day 1 followed by a 3-week taper. BCVA, best-corrected visual acuity; ETDRS, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study; IVT, intravitreal therapy; SD-OCT, spectral domain optical coherence tomography; QID, 4x/day; NCT03748784
In OPTIC, ADVM-022 continues to show robust treatment response from both high and low doses. In November 2020, we reported that we had observed long-term durability up to 92 weeks from a single IVT injection of ADVM-022 with zero anti-VEGF rescue injections in cohort 1 (high dose). The most recent OPTIC data presented at Angiogenesis 2021 demonstrated that patients who received 2 x 10^11 vg/eye of ADVM-022 experienced an 85% reduction in annualized anti-VEGF injections and two-thirds remained supplemental anti-VEGF injection free with median follow up of 48 weeks. Patients completing two years in OPTIC are being enrolled into an extension trial to be followed for up to five years. ADVM-022 continues to be well tolerated with a favorable safety profile at both high and low doses. We plan to present data from OPTIC, including one-year data from cohort 3, in the second quarter of 2021.
15 October 2020 OPTIC Data Cut. 
Five patients were diagnosed <1 year prior to ADVM-022 injection: one each in Cohorts 2 and 3, three in Cohort 4; 
* Cohort 1, Patient 1 remains on study but missed visits post Week 64; 
** Incomplete prior data for Cohort 4, Patient 2; 
† Received in a clinical trial not yet unmasked (NCT04049266).
Based on the promising data observed in OPTIC to date and our discussions with the FDA, we believe we have reached alignment on our clinical development and CMC requirements. We anticipate initiating two global Phase 3 trials for ADVM-022 in wet AMD in the fourth quarter of 2021. The two Phase 3 trials will study the efficacy and safety of two doses of ADVM-022 straddling the 2 x 10^11 vg/eye dose used in the OPTIC trial. In the Phase 3 trials in approximately 450 patients each, patients newly diagnosed with wet AMD will be randomized to one of 3 arms, receiving a single IVT injection of either 3 x 10^11 vg/eye or 1 x 10^11 vg/eye of ADVM-022 compared to aflibercept IVT every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint will be non-inferiority to aflibercept based on change from baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at one year. In addition, we believe that approximately 6% of patients with wet AMD are treated bilaterally from time of diagnosis and this grows to almost one-third within four years. We plan to evaluate the potential for bilateral treatment with ADVM-022 in order to include data on bilateral administration in our Biologics License Application (BLA) submission for the wet AMD application. With this approach, we are targeting submitting this BLA in 2024.
ADVM‑022 for Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema
Market for Treating Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema
Diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of vision loss in working-age adults, is caused by high blood sugar levels that cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. DME is a complication of diabetic retinopathy in which blood vessels can leak, causing retinal thickening and leading to vision impairment. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to grow, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is expected to increase.
Maintaining consistent levels of VEGF suppression with ADVM-022 could be particularly important for this rapidly-progressing disease. The current standard-of-care therapy for DME is anti-VEGF intravitreal (“IVT”) injections. These are effective but typically require eye injections every 4-12 weeks in order to maintain vision. Compliance with this regimen can be difficult for patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems, leading to undertreatment and resulting in loss of vision. We estimate that these standard-of-care branded anti-VEGF therapies used for the treatment of wet AMD, DME, retinal vein occlusion, and other ocular diseases generated in excess of $11 billion in sales worldwide in 2020 and that there are approximately 9 million patients with wet AMD and DME treatable with anti-VEGF therapy worldwide.
Advancing the Clinical Development of ADVM‑022 for Diabetic Macular Edema
We have advanced the development of ADVM-022 for the treatment of patients with DME by initiating the INFINITY trial, a phase 2 study in DME, in the second quarter of 2020. We announced completion of patient enrollment for INFINITY in January 2021.
The INFINITY trial is designed to demonstrate superior control of disease activity following a single IVT injection of ADVM-022 compared to a single aflibercept injection, as measured by time to worsening of DME disease activity in the study eye. Additional objectives include assessments of treatment burden, visual acuity, retinal anatomy and safety outcomes. Participants in this double-masked trial were randomized to one of three arms for their study eye treatment: Arm 1 received high dose (6 x 10^11 vg/eye) of ADVM-022, Arm 2 received low dose (2 x 10^11 vg/eye) of ADVM-022, and Arm 3 received aflibercept at a dose of 2 mg. We plan to present clinical data from INFINITY in the second half of 2021.
*All subjects receive a 7-week course of difluprednate eye drops, starting at QID and tapering to QD; **EOS= End of Study assessment; R=Randomized; BCVA = Best-Corrected Visual Acuity; CST = Central Subfield Thickness; DRSS = Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale
Additional Programs
Preclinical Product Candidates
In addition to our lead programs, we are currently utilizing our industry-leading development capabilities for our AAV-based directed evolution platform and are conducting observational studies. We are in the early stages of preclinical development for additional product candidates that we may advance in the future.
Partnered Program Product Candidates
We have licensed to GenSight rights to use AAV.7m8 for GS030 gene therapy encoding channelrhodopsin protein. GenSight is conducting a phase 1/2 trial in retinitis pigmentosa in the U.S., France, and U.K., which began in October 2018.
Manufacturing
Our AAV vector manufacturing process is based on the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (“BEVS”), which has been used in a number of FDA- and EMA-approved products. This approach is well suited for the production of large quantities of AAVs, as it takes advantage of the efficiency of viral infection coupled with the high density and scalability of insect cells grown in serum-free suspension cultures. Compared to the mammalian cell-based approaches commonly used in the field, our manufacturing process is designed to produce higher yields of vectors per manufacturing campaign in a cost-effective manner.
Our AAV manufacturing method is industrialized, highly scalable and ready for adaptation for commercial stage. We believe our process provides the following advantages over competing systems:
•Industrial-scale biologics production. Our BEVS system can produce quantities of product required at commercial stage by incorporating scalable, well-established process steps used throughout the industry for biologic products.
•Safety advantages. Our BEVS system does not use mammalian cell cultures or tumorigenic cell lines, and the DNA sequences used to allow AAV vector production are inactive in mammalian cells, which lowers the risk of off-target expression from our products in humans.
•High yield and low cost. Because of its scalability, our BEVS system may allow the production of large quantities of AAV vectors, up to the 2000-liter scale. 
•High purity. Our BEVS system coupled with our proprietary downstream purification process produces a highly pure drug substance.
•Precedent regulatory framework. Glybera, an AAV-based gene therapy authorized by the European Commission, and several other vaccines and recombinant protein therapies have been approved by the FDA and/or European Commission using a manufacturing process similar to our BEVS technology.
Our products are manufactured using proprietary cell banks and a scalable process developed internally that is transferred to approved Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). These CMOs produce investigational drugs under GMP conditions to support our clinical trials. Raw materials of highest quality are purchased from various suppliers and are used throughout the manufacturing process.
We continue to evaluate new raw material suppliers, as well as additional CMOs, in order to provide manufacturing flexibility. As we prepare for larger, late-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we have expanded our in-house process development capabilities, allowing us to develop larger-scale processes for transfer to our GMP contract manufacturers and our new internal GMP manufacturing site in North Carolina. This new site sets the foundation of our overall manufacturing strategy. We plan for it to provide dedicated commercial supply, while we continue to leverage GMP contract manufacturer partnerships for flexible clinical and additional commercial supply. This multi-source strategy capitalizes on our internal AAV manufacturing expertise while providing both security and flexibility as we prepare to potentially deliver one of the first gene therapies for large indications.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new proprietary technologies and therapies and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our single administration, intravitreal approach for the treatment of wet AMD and DME, our AAV-based directed evolution platform, and our expertise in the field of gene therapy provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face actual or potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
Our gene therapy ADVM‑022 for wet AMD and DME utilizes a proprietary vector and is administered through a single intravitreal injection and will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development, including biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. The key factors that contribute to success of any approved product include safety profile, efficacy, mode of administration and cost of goods. Existing anti-VEGF therapies are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard-of-care treatment of patients with wet AMD and DME.
We know of a significant number of product candidates in development for chronic retinal conditions that respond to anti-VEGF therapy, including wet AMD and DME, and we group them into four main categories:
•biosimilar anti-VEGFs (e.g., FYB201);
•combination / add-on therapy for efficacy or durability improvement (e.g., faricimab and OPT-302);
•next-generation anti-VEGF for durability improvement (e.g., KSI-301); and
•long-acting delivery device / gene therapy to lower treatment frequency (e.g., ranibizumab port delivery system, RGX-314).
There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of chronic retinal conditions that respond to anti-VEGF therapy, including wet AMD and DME. These companies include 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Bayer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Kodiak Sciences, Novartis, Opthea, Regeneron, and REGENXBIO.
These companies, as well as competitors we may face, either alone or with their partners, for our other product candidates, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments, and commercializing 
those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
License and Collaboration Agreements
University of California
AAV.7m8 License Agreement: In June 2013, we entered into an exclusive worldwide sublicensable license agreement with the Regents of University of California ("Regents”) to certain intellectual property related to improved AAV vectors, including the AAV.7m8 capsid. Under this license agreement, we are obligated to make certain de minimis license payments, certain milestone payments totaling up to $1.0 million upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for a first indication, and totaling up to $0.5 million for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. In addition, we are obligated to pay Regents royalties on sales of licensed products in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property covering the manufacture, use, or sale of such product in such country. We may terminate this agreement in whole or in party by giving Regents 30 days’ prior written notice. Regents may terminate this agreement for breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days, if we become insolvent, if we directly or through a third-party file a claim that a licensed patent right is invalid or unenforceable, or if we fail to meet or extend the date for meeting certain diligence milestones.
Cornell University
Cornell License Agreements
In December 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (“Annapurna”) entered into three licensing agreements with Cornell University (“Cornell”), related to our gene therapy programs ADVM‑043 and ADVM‑053, which originally were initiated at the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell.
A1AT Deficiency License Agreement: Under this agreement, we held an exclusive license to certain know-how related to A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND application to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT. Under our June 2019 settlement agreement with Cornell, our license to know-how was made non-exclusive.
HAE License Agreement: Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive license to certain technology related to HAE and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the HAE program.
Across these license agreements, Cornell is entitled to receive aggregate annual maintenance fees ranging from $30,000 to $0.3 million per year, up to $16.0 million in aggregate milestone payments and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
We may terminate any of these license agreements for convenience upon ninety days written notice. Cornell may terminate any of the license agreements for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Cornell may also terminate the HAE License Agreement if we commence any action and file a written claim asserting that any portion of the licensed patent rights is invalid or unenforceable.
GenSight
In February 2014, we entered into an agreement with GenSight, in which we granted GenSight a non-exclusive license to our proprietary AAV.7m8 vector to develop gene therapy products to deliver certain therapeutic transgenes. Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Also, we are eligible to receive low to mid-single digit royalties on sales of GenSight’s licensed products.
GenSight is currently developing GS030, a gene therapy encoding channelrhodopsin protein which incorporates the AAV.7m8 capsid. GenSight is conducting a phase 1/2 trial with GS030 to treat retinitis pigmentosa in the U.S., France, and the U.K., which began in October 2018.
Lexeo
In January 2020, we entered into an agreement with Lexeo Therapeutics, pursuant to which we granted Lexeo an exclusive license to the intellectual property rights, pre-clinical data and know how associated with our Friedrich’s Ataxia program. Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive development and commercial milestones and royalties related to sales of a product containing our licensed rights. Lexeo is currently developing LX2006, an adeno-associated virus mediated treatment.
Virovek
On October 12, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Virovek, Inc. (“Virovek”), in which we received a non-exclusive license to certain Virovek technology and know-how related to methods and materials for manufacturing AAV. Under the agreement, Virovek is entitled to certain license payments and low-single digit royalty payments. This license with Virovek continues in effect until expiration of the last-to-expire patent.
In May 2019, we received from Virovek a notice of intent to terminate our license agreement. We do not believe that Virovek has the right to terminate the license, and are seeking a mutually agreeable solution to this dispute.
Intellectual Property
Overview
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. Additionally, we may rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; obtain regulatory exclusivity and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We own or license more than 140 issued patents which are still in force, including more than twenty-five issued U.S. patents and five European patents validated in more than eighty countries, as well as more than 190 patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. These numbers include more than thirty patents and forty pending applications filed by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and abroad for a variety of technologies, including research tools and methods, AAV-based biological products, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.
Company-owned Intellectual Property
We own four patent families that are directed to AAV-based compositions and methods for treating or preventing eye diseases associated with neovascularization. Patents and applications in the first of these families relate to compositions and methods for the AAV-based delivery of anti-VEGF proteins, for use in treating neovascular diseases of the eye, including wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, in patients who respond to anti-VEGF protein therapy. Fourteen patents in this family have issued in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, and the Asia/Pacific region, and nineteen corresponding applications are pending in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term adjustments and patent term extensions. Patents and applications in the second of these families relate to AAV gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular diseases of the eye, including wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using the AAV.7m8 vector to deliver aflibercept. One issued European patent is validated in thirty-seven countries, one patent is issued in Asia, and at least eighteen corresponding applications are pending in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents in this family are generally expected to expire in 2037, subject to possible patent term adjustment and patent term extensions. The third of these families contains pending U.S. and corresponding foreign applications to AAV gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular diseases of the eye, including wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using the AAV.7m8 vector to deliver ranibizumab. Patents that may eventually issue from this patent family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2037, subject to possible patent term adjustments and patent term extensions. The fourth family contains eight pending applications including two pending PCT applications and corresponding national applications in the U.S., Asia, and South America, and is directed to methods of treating neovascular diseases of the eye, including wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, with AAV.7m8-aflibercept. Patents that may eventually issue from this family, if any, are generally expected to expire in 2039 to 2040 subject to possible patent term adjustments and patent term extensions.
We also own ten patent families that are directed to various aspects of our proprietary technology platform. Fourteen patents in these families have issued patents in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, including one issued European patent validated in six countries, as well as at least seventy-five pending applications, including PCT applications or national phase applications in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia. Patents that may eventually issue from these families, if any, are generally expected to expire between 2035 and 2040, subject to possible patent term extensions.
Licensed Intellectual Property
We have obtained both exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to patents directed to both compositions of matter and methods of use and to other intellectual property.
For example, we have exclusively licensed several families of patents and patent applications that relate to variant rAAV virions having desirable characteristics, such as increased infectivity, as well as novel methods to screen for such variants.
One patent family directed to improved rAAV virions that we have exclusively licensed in the ocular field includes ten granted patents in the U.S., elsewhere in North America and Europe, including one European patent validated in three countries, as well as two pending patent applications in the U.S. The patents in this family are projected to expire between 2024 and 2029 in the U.S. and in 2024 elsewhere, subject to possible patent term extensions.
Another patent family directed to improved rAAV virions that we have exclusively licensed includes three granted U.S. patents and a pending U.S. patent application that are expected to expire in 2031, subject to possible patent term extensions.
A third patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes claims directed to the novel AAV.7m8 vector, which allows delivery of transgenes to the retina via intravitreal injection, and which we utilize in our product candidate ADVM‑022. This family includes at least fifty issued patents in the U.S., elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific, including a European patent validated in thirty-seven countries. Seventeen corresponding applications are pending in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2032, subject to possible patent term extensions.
We have also non-exclusively licensed rights to a patent family related to the Baculovirus/SF9 production system that includes eight issued patents in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, including a European patent validated in three countries. These patents are expected to expire in 2027.
We have licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for HAE, C1-esterase deficiency, which includes three issued patents in the U.S. and Asia, and twelve pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments.
We have exclusively licensed a family of patents and applications related to the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich’s Ataxia. This family includes two granted U.S. patents and fourteen pending applications in the U.S. and elsewhere in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. In January 2021, we granted an exclusive (even as to us) sublicense to this patent family, which does not relate to ADVM-022, to Lexeo Therapeutics.
Trade Secret Protection
In some circumstances we may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology and product candidates, including aspects for which we do not obtain patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential information and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation 
In the U.S., biological products, including gene therapy products, are primarily regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), as well as corresponding implementing regulations promulgated by the FDA. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of biologics products. Prior to conducting human clinical testing of our gene therapy products, we must submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) to the FDA, and the IND must become effective.
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (“OTAT”). The FDA has also established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review.
The FDA has published a growing body of guidance documents on topics relevant to the development of our product candidates, including, among other things, gene therapy products developed for retinal disorders, rare diseases; patient-focused drug development, preclinical testing of gene therapy products; CMC information requirements for gene therapy; and observation of subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events. All of these guidance documents are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. Guidance documents provide the FDA’s current thinking about a particular subject, but are not legally binding on either the FDA or the regulated industry.
The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•Completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, including evaluations of product chemistry, formulations, and toxicity and animal studies in accordance with current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•Submission of an IND to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•Approval by the independent institutional review board (“IRB”) of each clinical protocol and each clinical trial site before the trial may be initiated at that site;
•Approval by the institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”) of each clinical trial site, which assesses the safety of research involving, among other things, recombinant DNA, and identifies any potential risks to public health or the environment;
•Generation of substantial evidence from human clinical trials, conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and potency of the biologic product for its proposed indication;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of each manufacturing facility at which the biologic product is produced, to assure that the product is produced in compliance with GMP, regulations, and any additional requirements made by the agency to assure that the methods and controls used during manufacturing are adequate to preserve the biological product’s safety, identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
•Submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that demonstrates purity, safety and potency of the biological product based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, as well as information on the chemistry, manufacturing and controls to ensure product identity and quality, as well as proposed labeling;
•Successful completion of FDA audit(s) of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites and the clinical study sponsor that generated the data in support of the BLA;
•Successful completion of the advisory committee review, if the FDA convenes an advisory committee; and
•Payment of user fees and FDA review and licensure of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.
The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions relating to the content of the IND during the review period or places the clinical study on a clinical hold. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the IND goes into effect and the clinical trial begins. The FDA can impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold on an IND, clinical trials may not commence or proceed without FDA authorization, and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical trials involve administering of the investigational biological product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, who are generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent IRB, and IBC, at each institution where the clinical trial will be conducted must also review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that institution, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. For certain types of research, including research involving recombinant DNA, the IBC will also assess the safety of the research and identify any potential risk to public health or the environment, until the research is completed. Clinical testing also must satisfy GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent from all subjects.
All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA as described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial as support for a BLA if (i) the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP as further detailed in the regulation, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and (ii) if the FDA is able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection, if necessary. In addition, when an applicant submits data from a foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND to support a BLA, the FDA requires a description of the actions the applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Further, additional requirements apply when a sponsor intends to base marketing approval of a new drug solely on foreign clinical data.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
•Phase 2 clinical trials are typically conducted in a larger subject population than Phase 1 trials to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications. For Phase 2 clinical trials in gene therapy, although the subject population may be larger than the Phase 1 trials, the subject population may still remain relatively limited.
•Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the biological product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse subject population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate.
•Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional data from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for any serious and unexpected adverse event that occurs during the study, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the clinical protocol or Investigator’s Brochure, as well as any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects from the product candidate. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Similar rules govern the conduct of clinical trials in the European Economic Area (EEA).
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is often not uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU legislator has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation has been delayed. The EU Clinical Trials Directive may be replaced with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation in late 2022.
Clinical trials in the EU must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by the individual EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, designed to facilitate safety reporting. The database includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these clinical trials.
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
In accordance with 42 CFR Part 11, the responsible party for an applicable clinical trial must register the clinical trial in Phase 2 or later on the ClinicalTrials.gov website, the registry of new, on-going, and completed clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and device products.
Biologics License Applications
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trial(s), together with detailed information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless a waiver applies, and is subject to a sixty-day filing review period to determine if the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has a performance goal to review applications within 6 months from successful filing of the application for priority reviews or 10 months for standard reviews. The review timeline begins upon the FDA’s acceptance of the original application submission for filing, no later than 60 calendar days from the date the FDA receives the application. In some instances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended depending on the information required in order for the FDA reviewers to complete their review of the BLA.
The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny licensure of a BLA by issuing a complete response letter if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, and may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if a product receives licensure, the licensure may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited or subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 
Once the FDA licenses a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the licensure if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Even where a withdrawal is not required, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of product already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of licensed biologics that have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Before licensing a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the biologic is manufactured and will not license the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements. The FDA may also inspect the site(s) at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their GCP compliance and will not approve the product unless compliance with the IND study requirements and GCP requirements is satisfactory.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA that include new efficacy data, the FDA intends to review and act on the supplemental application within 10 months of receipt. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
A biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHSA (a “reference product”) can receive 12 years of marketing exclusivity, four years of which constitute data exclusivity. In other words, no biosimilar application that cites the reference product can be submitted to the FDA until four years after approval of the reference product, and no biosimilar application that cites the reference product can be approved during the full 12-year period. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilars—companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA may be approved earlier than 12 years.
In the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related Marketing Authorization, or MA, has been granted. Marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all 27 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations, or EFTA, countries (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) all of whom make up the EEA.
The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, regenerative medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients at EU level in the EU.
The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh, for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
In the EU, biological products authorized according to the centralized authorization procedure are entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity and 10 years’ market exclusivity. 
The procedure for approval of biosimilars following expiry of exclusivity differs from that for generic medicinal products. Developers of biosimilars must demonstrate through comprehensive comparability studies with the “reference” biological medicine that their biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference medicine, notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality and efficacy.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has provided guidance to sponsors developing regenerative medicine therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, with recommendations on the expedited development and review of these therapies, as provided under the FD&C Act and the 21st Century Cures Act.
Fast track designation. To qualify for fast track designation, a product candidate must be intended to treat a serious condition and address an unmet medical need. Advantages of fast track designation include the possibility for a rolling review, eligibility for priority review, and the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA. In addition, under the Fast Track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a biologic product based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or conditions that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A biologic product candidate approved using a surrogate endpoint is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials to confirm the beneficial effect on a clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct or to confirm a clinical benefit during these required trials may result in FDA withdrawal of the approved biologic product from the market.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation, priority review designation, and accelerated approval.
Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, a product candidate must be intended to treat a serious condition, and have preliminary clinical data indicating that it provides a substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross‑disciplinary review; and rolling review.
Regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation. To qualify for the RMAT designation, a product candidate must be a regenerative medicine therapy intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and there must be preliminary clinical evidence that the candidate has the potential to address the unmet medical need. The FDA has indicated that gene therapies may qualify as regenerative medicine therapies. Advantages of RMAT designation include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints and address potential ways to support accelerated approval and satisfy post-approval requirements.
Priority review. A product, including those that receive fast track, breakthrough therapy, or RMAT designations, may be eligible for priority review, if the product meets the criteria for priority review at the time the BLA is submitted. If priority review is granted, the FDA has a 6-month goal for reviewing the marketing application or efficacy supplement.
Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products with evidence showing that they provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for serious or life‑threatening illnesses may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor conduct post‑marketing clinical trials.
Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”)
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. will be recovered from sales of the product.
ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. ODD does not affect the regulatory review and approval process. However, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for that product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, that product is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product in the approved indication. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the user fee. In January 2020, the FDA published a draft Guidance For Industry providing the current thinking on determining “sameness” for gene therapy products for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity.
In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to products that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Medicinal products for which orphan designation has been granted are entitled to a range of benefits during the development and regulatory review process and to ten years of exclusivity in all EU member states upon approval. As in the U.S., a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication may be approved, notwithstanding orphan product exclusivity, if the exclusivity holder gives consent or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity granted in relation to the original orphan medicinal product may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA or EU and other governmental authorities’ approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other governmental authorities, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, or equivalent EU and other governmental authorities and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, certain state agencies and EU and other governmental authorities for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other ongoing FDA, EU or other governmental authorities’ regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA, EMA, EU Member State or other governmental authorities may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic.
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. For example, under the FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, in proactively promoting a biologic, a company generally can make only those substantiated claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications approved by the FDA and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the biologic. Claims must be truthful and non-misleading. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in fines, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by the sponsor and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. If the FDA finds that we have promoted off-label use of any product that is eventually approved, sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Other relevant laws at EU level and in the individual EU member states also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and to health care professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. 
Privacy Laws
The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy, data protection, and data security continues to evolve, and there has been increasing scrutiny in this area which may affect our business. Numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security govern the collection, use, disclosure, and processing of personal information, including health information. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and differ from or conflict with each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, which complicates compliance efforts and may increase our exposure to regulatory enforcement action, sanctions, and litigation. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys, including class action attorneys, have been and will likely continue to be active in this space.
For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in the EU in 2018 and imposes comprehensive privacy, data protection, and data security obligations on businesses with stringent penalties for noncompliance. The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. Similarly, Brazil recently enacted the General Data Protection Law, which broadly regulates the processing of personal information in a manner comparable to the GDPR and allows for substantial penalties for violations. Domestically, states have also begun to enact comprehensive privacy, data protection, and data security laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act impose numerous obligations on certain businesses that handle personal information of California residents. Businesses that violate these laws face civil penalties and private litigation.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any health care item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor, or for which no exception or safe harbor is available, may be subject to scrutiny;
•The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the United States Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual (a whistleblower) in the name of the government and the individual, and the whistleblower may share in any monetary recovery. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including: providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing sham consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Because of the threat of treble damages and mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs; 
•Federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to direct and indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided in the previous year (i.e., 2021) to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives;
•Outside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU member states. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Certain EU member states, or industry codes of conduct, require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment; and
•State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove costly.
In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry have received increased public and governmental scrutiny for the cost of drugs. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices and the U.S. Senate is investigating several pharmaceutical companies relating to drug price increases and pricing practices. If we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of gene therapy products. In the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. A number of gene or cell therapy products have been approved over the past several years by the FDA. For example, although CMS has approved coverage for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapies, such as Yescarta and Kymriah, and has established reimbursement methods for these therapies, these policies could be changed in the future. CMS’s decision as to coverage and reimbursement for one product does not mean that all similar products will be eligible for analogous coverage and reimbursement. As there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement amongst third-party payors in the United States, even if CMS approves coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates, it is unclear what affect, if any, such a decision will have on our ability to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from other private payors.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, by increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and imposing annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and other measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and other measures, could limit coverage of or payments for pharmaceuticals, or affect rebates or other price concessions owed on such products. Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Currently, the Supreme Court is considering whether the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, post-repeal of its associated tax penalty, is unconstitutional, and, if so, whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are inseverable from the mandate. A ruling is expected by mid-2021 and could produce any of a number of results, including invalidation of the Affordable Care Act in its entirety if there is a finding of inseverability. It is unclear how the ultimate decision in this case, or other efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, as well as health care reform measures of the Biden administration, will affect our business. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through May 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others, policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs thereunder, including work requirements, and policies that make it more difficult to access health benefits through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act.
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. Any such changes could affect the number of individuals with health coverage. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. 
At this time, it is unclear whether such legislative changes, regulatory changes, or judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act, or other health care reform measures will also have an impact on biologic product exclusivity, or the biosimilar product licensure pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule to implement a “Most Favored Nation” demonstration project to test Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain separately payable drugs and biologicals based on international reference prices. The rule has become subject to judicial challenges, and federal courts have enjoined the rule at this time. If the rule survives judicial scrutiny or is otherwise permitted to proceed to implementation, the Most Favored Nation model will subject certain drugs or biologicals identified by CMS as having the highest annual Medicare Part B spending to an alternative payment methodology based on international reference prices, with the list of products to be updated annually to add more products and products not to be removed absent limited circumstances. There has also been legislation that would establish an international reference price-based Medicare Part B drug and biological payment methodology. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare financing, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from commercial payors. Coverage policies and reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action could be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Similar to what is occurring in the U.S., political, economic and regulatory developments outside of the U.S. are also subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes and challenges. Pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels continue to exist. In various EU member states, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health technology assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally compares attributes of individual medicinal products, as compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for an HTA regulation intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products. The proposal, which currently continues its progress through the EU adoption process, provides that EU member states will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social and ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 
The making available or placing on the EU market of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited. However, the competent authorities of the EU member states may exceptionally and temporarily allow and reimburse the supply of such unauthorized products, either on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process, to individual patients or a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient or compassionate use programs expire or is terminated or if marketing authorization is granted for the product. In some EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. After initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries. In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states.
The availability of adequate government reimbursement for our products may also be subject to regulatory changes and controls.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. Many countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. To obtain regulatory approval of a biological medicinal product under European Union (EU) regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
In addition to regulations in the EU and the U.S., we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future products.
Testing and Approval of Pharmaceutical Products in the EU. The EU and many individual countries have regulatory structures similar to the U.S. for conducting preclinical and clinical testing and applying for marketing approval or authorization, although specifics may vary widely from country to country. Clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, as implemented in national law by individual EU member states, and applicable good clinical practice standards. The EU Clinical Trials Directive may be replaced with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation in late 2021. In the EU, there are several procedures for requesting marketing authorization which can be more efficient than applying for authorization on a country-by-country basis. There is a “centralized” procedure allowing submission of a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. If the EMA issues a positive opinion, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biotechnology-derived medicinal products, and optional for others. There is also a “decentralized” procedure allowing companies to file identical applications to several EU member states simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state and a “mutual recognition” procedure allowing companies that have a product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an application in the EU under the centralized procedure is 210 days, subject to certain exceptions and clock stops. An initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years, with renewal subject to reevaluation of the risk-benefit profile of the product. Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
In the EU, if an applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the product under normal conditions of use cannot be provided due to certain specified objective and verifiable reasons, products may be granted marketing authorization “under exceptional circumstances.” A marketing authorization granted under exceptional circumstances is valid for five years, subject to an annual reassessment of conditions imposed by the European Commission.
The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has, however, created significant uncertainty concerning the extent to which the UK and the EU regulatory environments may diverge in the future. Any such divergence may lead to increased costs and administrative burden. The impact of Brexit on the on-going validity in the UK of current EU authorizations for medicinal products, whether granted through the centralized procedure, decentralized procedure, or mutual recognition, and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK remains uncertain. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the Agreement includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the Agreement. The Annex provides a framework for the recognition of GMP inspections and for the exchange and acceptance of official GMP documents. The regime does not, however, extended to procedures such as batch release certification. Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the Agreement, the EU and the UK will recognize GMP inspections carried out by the other Party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other Party. The Agreement also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release for a period of at least 2 years until 1 January 2023. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use. As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain will have a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the EC. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is the UK competent authority for the regulation and authorizations or medicinal products in the UK.
Manufacture of Medicinal Products in the EU. In the EU, a manufacturing authorization from the national regulatory authority of the member state in which the manufacturing of medicinal products is carried out is required to manufacture medicinal products. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing products and their APIs, including APIs manufactured outside of the EU with the intention of importing them into the EU. In addition to inspection reports, manufacturers and marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in cases of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to manufacturing.
Data Exclusivity. In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier qualify for eight years’ data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years’ market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Data exclusivity periods are currently the same in Great Britain as in the EU. However, following Brexit, the UK could change the duration of data exclusivity periods under its national legislation.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship, environmental protection, and handling or disposition of products, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, release, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials, medical waste, and infectious materials. Some of these laws and regulations also require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. If we fail to comply with such laws or obtain and comply with the applicable permits, we could face substantial fines or possible revocation of our permits or limitations on our ability to conduct our operations. Certain of our development and manufacturing activities involve use of hazardous materials, and we believe we are in compliance with the applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits, and licenses. However, we cannot ensure that EHS liabilities will not develop in the future. EHS laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 167 full-time employees. Of these employees, 25 hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 112 are engaged in research and development, and 55 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, information technology, and general management and administration. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We have a relatively low turnover of employees, which we attribute to our shared mission of transforming the lives of those affected by ocular and rare diseases.
Our employees are one of our most valuable assets and are essential to our success. We have been purposeful in our efforts to hire, develop and retain diverse talent as well as create an inclusive culture. We are investing in the creation of a work environment that values the health, safety and wellness of our team, and where our employees are inspired to deliver their best every day. All employees are responsible for upholding the Adverum Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as complying with our Employee Handbook, which together form the foundation of our policies and practices. We continue to expand our systems to track key human capital metrics such as demographics, diversity, compensation and benefits, and engagement.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
A diverse and inclusive workforce is a business imperative. Our employees bring diversity to our workplace across many critical categories, and we believe our company is stronger as a result of their variety of experiences and backgrounds. We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment where our employees can bring their best selves to work each day. As we grow and mature, we look forward to establishing programs that bring in speakers on specific topics, assemble resources for employees on diversity and inclusion, provide support for our female and underrepresented employees to help advance their careers, all while continuing to focus on hiring diverse talent at all levels of the company.
Compensation and Benefits
Our commitment to our employees starts with benefit and compensation programs that value their contributions and offer physical, financial and personal health programs to them and their families. We strive to provide pay, benefits and services that are competitive to market and create incentives to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare and retirement benefits, and paid time off. We also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Program through which employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price, and offer stipends to cover expenses associated with working from home and the use of personal devices for work purposes. Additionally, we continue to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by complying with all applicable statutory filing requirements. 
Communication and Engagement
We strongly believe that Adverum’s success depends on our employees understanding how their work contributes to the company’s overall strategy. We strive to foster open and direct communication, and seek to empower our employees to be our greatest ambassadors. We use a variety of channels to facilitate this exchange of information, including quarterly business updates from the senior management team; regular all hands meetings, open forums and company-wide written communications; postings on our company intranet; and employee engagement surveys. 
Health, Wellness and Safety
Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us, particularly in light of COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we have taken extra precautions to reduce the risk of virus exposure for our employees. We provide protective equipment for our employees working on site, have implemented new safety protocols and procedures, and provide access for weekly COVID-19 testing. We have also established a governance structure to ensure timely communication and decision making. For our remote employees, we provide productivity and collaboration tools and resources, allow flexible schedules and support their information technology needs. We also regularly promote employee assistance programs to support our employees’ physical, financial and mental well-being.
