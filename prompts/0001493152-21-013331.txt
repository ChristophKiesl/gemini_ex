ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
The Company is structured as a holding company with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. We are not a “blank check company” as defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. Your rights as a holder of shares, and the fiduciary duties of the Company’s Board of Directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto are set forth in the documents governing the Company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, the documents governing the Company specify that the duties of its directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation.
 
The Company’s Board of Directors will oversee the management of the Company and our businesses. Initially, the Company’s Board of Directors will be comprised of seven (7) directors, with five (5) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and two (2) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class B common stock, and at least five (5) of whom will be the Company’s independent directors.
 
We have accumulated a deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020 and will likely require significant additional capital to implement our business plan.
 
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
 
We anticipate that the operating businesses we acquire will be managed on a decentralized basis with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and minimal involvement by the Company’s corporate senior management teams in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. The Company’s corporate senior management team anticipates that it will participate in and have ultimate responsibility for significant decisions, such as capital allocation, investment activities and the selection of a chief executive officer for each of the operating businesses. We will also be responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring corporate governance policies and practices, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed.
 
We expect that our business activities at the holding company level will be are managed by a small senior corporate management team, who will research and identify attractive investment opportunities; delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers; set operating subsidiary goals; assist managers in the achievement of those goals; define risk parameters; develop appropriate incentive programs; and monitor progress against long-term objectives.
 
We believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many stakeholders in potential control transactions may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that securities or whole businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term corporate objectives of increasing shareholder value.
 
Our objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management’s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return.
 
Investment Strategy
 
We will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at what we believe to be a fair price relative to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company’s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns that outperforms the broader market. We plan to target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence.
 
We believe that an investment strategy focused on investments with these character traits coupled with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value.

Management Strategy
 
Our management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we anticipate acquiring in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn increasing stockholder value. In general, we plan to oversee and support the management team of each of our businesses by, among other things:

● | recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals: 
● | assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies: 
● | identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and 
● | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 

 
Our investment strategy centers around our ability to consistently seek to acquire securities and/or companies at a discount to intrinsic value as determined by various metrics, including without limitation, replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
 
We utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investing approach. This approach generally involves three (3) critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation, capital structure and security analysis; (ii) intense analysis of fulcrum issues, such as litigation, taxes and regulation, that often affect valuation; and (iii) a deep understanding and analysis of contextual factors that often affect the risk-adjusted attractiveness of an investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market price dislocations that create attractive buying opportunities. These dislocations may be caused by such factors as broad-based market drawdowns; busted auction processes; out of favor, short term industry perceptions; market euphoria; litigation; complex contingent liabilities; corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance; general bearish economic conditions; and / or complex and inappropriate capital structures.
 
While we plan to principally focus on deploying a material portion of our investable capital into acquiring controlling interests in privately held and/or thinly traded middle market operating businesses, we may employ a number of acquisition strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities including: (i) publicly traded equities; (ii) publicly traded bonds and privately issued, non-investment grade debt, bank debt and other corporate obligations; and (iii) privately issued and publicly traded structured equity and other preferred equity securities.
 
Key Elements of Our Strategy:
 
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
 

● | Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets. We intend to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We will also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies/assets that experience busted sell-side auction processes, disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Utilize a Low-Cost Model. We believe our low overhead model will allow us to more effectively utilize excess cash flows from our portfolio of operating businesses and securities to enhance stockholder through efficient capital allocation activities. 
● | Internal Resources and External Network Sufficient to Drive Accretive Opportunities. We believe our internal management team and their strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us a strong pipeline of opportunities. Additionally, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target. 
● | Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our management team is accountable directly to our board of directors and has day-to-day responsibility for general oversight of our business and for capital allocation decisions of our operating businesses. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner’s perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we will look for senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors.

Competition
 
In our core business, which is the acquisition of operating businesses and securities, we face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than us, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline, and our business could be harmed.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we had six (6) employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
 
Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
 
The adverse public health developments and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States could adversely affect the Company’s business. Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely make it more difficult to identify and acquire potential candidates, as well as limit the availability of acquisition financing. The Company cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.
