Item 1. Business Introduction
Our Core Business



Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. (“Kandi Technologies”) is a Delaware holding company, with its common stock being traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries established in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, including Zhejiang Kandi Technologies Group, Co. Ltd. (“Zhejiang Kandi Technologies”) and U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”) and their subsidiaries. 



Originally, our primary business operations consist of designing, developing, manufacturing and commercializing electric vehicle (“EV”) products and EV parts. However, in recent years, some EV enterprises in China are seizing market share at the cost of huge losses. We gradually realized that the EV market of China has not reached a healthy and orderly development stage. Therefore, with our financial condition, it is unwise to participate in this “loss competition” at this stage. We always firmly believe that only with the maturity of changing-battery-model can EV be truly popularized. Since we have advanced EV intelligent battery swap equipment, manufacturing capacity of EV with intelligent battery swap mode and dozens of patented technologies in battery swap, we will continue to improve and perfect in the field of online car hailing with battery swap mode, and will make full efforts when the EV market of China enters a healthy and orderly development stage. Now with the global trend of “fuel to electrification” of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious and huge market demand, in 2022, we will apply EV technology to off-road vehicle products and launch a variety of pure electric utility vehicles (“UTV”), Neighborhood EVs (“NEVs”), Golf carts and off-road crossover vehicles. We will fully enter the off-road vehicle market utilizing the high-end technology that accumulated by Kandi in the field of EVs over the past years, and strive to achieve a leading position in this field in China within three years.



We do not believe that our major business is within the targeted areas of concern by the Chinese government. However, because of the Company’s subsidiaries in the PRC and its operations there, there is a risk that the Chinese government may in the future seek to affect operations of any company with any level of operations in the PRC, including its ability to offer securities to investors, list its securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange, conduct its business or accept foreign investment. Additionally, we are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our current business operations are uncertain, and therefore, these risks may result in a material change in our operations, significant depreciation of the value of our common stock, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact of such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.

Our Organizational Structure



The Company’s organizational chart as of the date of this report is as follows:






Please refer to the discussion in NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report for a narrative of our organization structure and operating subsidiaries, including their dates of incorporation and history.
Industry Overview



Over the years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the automobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. China has relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been implementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditional fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. We believe China is a huge prospective market for pure electric vehicles. We also believe that in the global automobile industry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicles and their core parts industry in the future. In addition, with the global trend of “fuel to electrification” of off-road vehicles becoming more and more obvious and huge market demand, management believes this industry still has huge development space.

Competitive Landscape



In general, our EV and electric off-road vehicles business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.



In terms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle and off-road vehicles manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric vehicle and electric off-road vehicles manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel vehicles and off-road vehicles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV and electric off-road vehicles industry.
Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy



Due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource dependence, the new energy industry is developing vigorously. Given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience, Kandi has benefited from the development of EV and electric off-road vehicles industry.



Our business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations. We also provide products to end users through our distributors.



Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most popular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the online ride-sharing program (“Online Ride-Sharing Program”).



In order to create an ecosphere of EV changing-battery-model, on October 22, 2020, the Company entered into a strategic agreement with Zhejiang State Grid Electric Vehicle Service Company. The two parties will cooperate extensively across the whole supply chain for electric vehicle-battery exchange. This in-depth collaboration will focus on the following areas: centralized constant temperature battery charging, distribution, maintenance, battery recycling, construction and operation of power exchange networks, power exchange services to meet energy demand, grid auxiliary services, flexible control of power load exchange, as well as other value-added services for power exchange stations. The two parties will first start their collaboration in the project of “300,000 government-accredited ride-sharing vehicles within 5 years” (the “Online Ride-Sharing Project”) initiated by Kandi, and then expand into new areas of cooperation based on the progress in this collaboration. Now the Online Ride-Sharing Project is operated by Ruiheng, the investee of Zhejiang Kandi Technologies. Currently, there are two modes of car-share programs in the market. One is that a car rental service provider offers its cars at certain locations, and customers can pick up cars at these locations by themselves. The other mode is that a service provider will deliver cars to the customers pursuant to their need and request made through the service provider’s network platform. A service provider will provide pick-up service with a driver, commonly known as the online ride-sharing service program. Now online ride-sharing service program is one of the most active sharing economy models in China. The innovative business model of the five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service program initiated by us provides an excellent solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to the online platform use the changing battery model, which solves problems including high price of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential pollution problem. Furthermore this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which prolongs the usage life of the battery and realize green energy efficiency We believe that this upgrade to Online Ride-Sharing Program from MPT (“Micro Public Transportation”) advocated and practiced by Kandi do have the opportunity to become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of EV changing-battery-model ecosphere in the future.



SC Autosports is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in the wholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from wholesale and retail of off-road vehicle parts. It has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. Kandi Technologies acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports on July 1, 2028.

During 2020, the Company received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models – the K23 and K27 – via Certificates of Conformity. However, until now, the airbags of the products have not met the technical requirements of the United States. Therefore, the launch time of the above-mentioned two products in the United States is still uncertain. Currently, the low-speed versions (NEV) of K23 and K27, which are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States, and now have gradually begun to be delivered to customers. The prototypes of our UTV K32 were delivered to SC Autosports for dealers to review and provide feedback. The initial feedback we received was positive and we also received some suggestions. We have made improvement based on the suggestions and plan to deliver first batch of K32 in the late first quarter of 2022. Since the beginning of 2021, we have been signing up and delivering NEV to Kandi’s dealers. The potential buyers can reserve a NEV K23 or K27 by paying a fully unconditionally refundable $100 deposit on our website. Once we receive the reservation fee and request, we will pass the reservation to dealers, who will then contact the potential buyers to complete the purchase process, the completion of which is subject to which payment method the buyers may utilize and the approval of a bank if a loan is needed. Regarding our latest model off-road UTV K32, similar to NEV K23 and K27, we are taking reservations made through our website and plan to deliver first batch of K32 to dealers in the late first quarter of 2022. Please be advised that that we are using online reservations as a lead generator for our dealerships. The final sales will be completed by our dealers. The prototypes shown on our website on our website will be the final models for delivery. Currently SC Autosports sells through the authorized dealers covering more than thirty states, from western coast to eastern coast in the U.S. for its NEV and off-road vehicles. SC Autosports also sells parts and youth vehicles on its website www.partsBoss.com.

Environmental and Safety Regulation



Emissions



Our products are all subject to international laws and emissions related standards and regulations, including regulations and related standards established by China Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and European and Canadian legislative bodies.



According to the management’s knowledge, the Company’s products have been designed and developed according to the environmental regulations of the target market since the research and development period, and have passed the corresponding tests before the products are put into production and sales, and obtained the compulsory product certification of the corresponding countries and regions.



If the standards and rules we execute are modified, or interpreted differently, or the product certification certificate expires, we will evaluate the product and restart the corresponding product design improvement and product testing/certification procedures to continuously ensure the target market environment regulatory compliance. The Company cannot estimate the extent to which these changes, if any, will affect our operating costs in the future.



Product Safety and Regulation



Safety Regulation



The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi’s products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and regulates the safety of electric vehicles for road vehicles.



In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “Product Safety Act”) was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (“ANSI/SVIA”) safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Both Kandi and SC Autosports currently comply with the ANSI/SVIA standard.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles.



Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally.



The Company has received the required clearance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its two electric vehicle (EV) models, the K23 and K27 via Certificates of Conformity. We performed self-inspection comparing to the safety standards published by the United States Department of Transportation. However, until now, the airbags of the products have not met the technical requirements of the United States. Therefore, We are also in the process of modifying features, upgrading the software and technology to cater for our potential U.S. customers. Currently, the low-speed versions (NEV) of K23 and K27, which are specifically designed for the U.S. market have met the relevant requirements in the United States.

Under the condition that SC Autosports purchased electric golf crossover vehicles from Jiangsu Xingchi Electric Technology Co., Ltd. (“Jiangsu Xingchi”), but Jiangsu Xingchi’s existing production capacity is far from meeting the needs of the U.S. market, in order to expand production capacity as soon as possible to meet the needs of the U.S. market, on February 15, 2022, Kandi Hainan and Jiangsu Xingchi jointly invested RMB 30,000,000 (approximately $4.6 million) in Haikou, Hainan (of which Kandi Hainan owns 66.7% and Jiangsu Xingchi owns 33.3%) to establish Hainan Kandi Holding New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (“Hainan Kandi Holding”). Hainan Kandi Holding will specialize in the production of electric golf crossover vehicles and other products in Kandi Hainan’s factory.
