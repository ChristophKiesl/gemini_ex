Company and Product Overview
KushCo Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Kush Bottles, Inc.) markets and sells a wide variety of ancillary products and services to customers operating in the regulated medical and adult recreational cannabis and hemp-derived cannabidiol (“CBD”) industries. 
Our products primarily consist of bottles, jars, bags, tubes, containers, vape cartridges, vape batteries and accessories, labels and processing supplies, solvents, natural products, stainless steel tanks, and custom branded anti-counterfeit and authentication labels. We maintain relationships with a broad range of domestic and international manufacturers, which enables us to source a wide variety of products in a cost-effective manner and to pass such cost savings on to our customers. In addition to a complete product line, we have sophisticated labeling and customization capabilities, which allow us to add significant value to our customers’ packaging and vape hardware design processes, enabling them to turn their packaging and branding into an effective marketing tool. As more multi-state operators (“MSOs”), licensed producers (“LPs”), and leading brands seek ways to further differentiate their brands and product lines, our customization capabilities and premium customer service help us win new product opportunities with both existing and new customers. Our products are relied upon by brand owners, farmers, growers, processors, producers, distributors, and licensed medical and adult recreational cannabis retailers.
Our services primarily consist of retail services and hemp trading services, which focus on facilitating compliant hemp transactions for in-network, pre-qualified farmers and a pre-qualified buyer network. Our retail services division focuses on building distribution networks of compliant hemp-derived CBD brands across conventional and other retail channels, including convenience, pet care, and beauty channels.
As a leader in custom and child-resistant compatible packaging, exclusive vape products, and unique product and service offerings, such as our stainless steel tanks, hemp trading services, and retail services, we serve as a “one-stop-shop” for our customers, combining creativity with compliance knowledge and experience to provide solutions in various stages of the cannabis and CBD supply chain. 
Due to the complementary nature of our product and service ecosystem, we are able to successfully cross-sell into our existing customer base, while attracting new customers who are looking to consolidate their vendors and partner with a trusted and established source for nearly all ancillary cannabis and CBD solutions.
Packaging, Papers, and Supplies: We offer a wide variety of child-resistant compatible, customizable, and sustainable packaging solutions, including bottles, bags, tubes, and containers, which come in a variety of sizes and colors. Representing the Company’s founding segment, our packaging, papers, and supplies segment is not a commodity, and often requires a significant degree of customization and modification in order to adhere to each jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements. We believe we have a leading position in fully customizable labeling and packaging solutions to address the different state-by-state and national regulatory requirements. Our focus and investments on printing, molding, and other equipment help ensure that we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers with respect to a variety of form factors and unique markets. 
Vaporizer Hardware and Technology: We offer a wide selection of vaporizer cartridges in a variety of form factors (510 thread cartridge, pod systems, disposables, etc.) with reservoir materials including polyamide 12 or glass, internal materials consisting of brass or stainless steel, and porous ceramic heating core technology. We also offer a wide selection of batteries to accommodate the vape cartridges. All vaporizer cartridges, batteries, and disposable units can be customized for clients, including adjusting colors/finishes, materials, and adding logos and branding as directed by our clients’. We deliver the vaporizer products directly to clients, unassembled and empty, where the product is subsequently filled and assembled at the client’s place of business by their qualified staff. We entered this segment in 2017 in response to customer demand and trends indicating vape as the fastest growing cannabis category for the foreseeable future. We are a leading distributor for CCELL, a dominant vape device supplier, which specializes in premium and high-quality vape hardware.
Energy and Natural Products: We provide ultra-pure solvents, including but not limited to isobutane, n-butane, propane, ethanol, pre-mixes, custom blends, and dry ice. These substances are essential in the extraction process, which produces products that supply the vaping and concentrate sector of the market. We ship these products to customers from various distribution hubs and strategic vendor partnerships in key markets across the country. We believe we are the only cannabis industry supplier to offer stainless steel tanks, which have been shown through independent studies to be significantly cleaner than traditional carbon steel tanks that often leave a trail of contaminants in the cannabis or CBD oil. Our new stainless steel 
tanks are available in standard LP239 cylinder sizes and are resistant to rust and degradation, are less brittle compared to carbon steel tanks, do not react from exposure to air or moisture, and are pre-cleaned before being filled, providing a cleaner vessel during the extraction process and resulting in a higher quality end product. In addition, we are a distribution platform for products manufactured by Abstrax Tech. Abstrax Tech specializes in botanically-derived terpene blends, terpene isolates, water-soluble terpene blends, and diluents, with all products consisting of ingredients from non-cannabis sources. These products are utilized by our customers for a wide variety of applications. These products are ordered through us and drop shipped to our customers by the vendor, where they are then incorporated into finished products by the customer.
CBD Services: Our CBD services division focuses on mass retail execution, merchandising, and sales management for compliant hemp-derived CBD products, with hemp trading solutions for growers and processors. Our retail services business focuses on industry education and compliance, as well as building distribution networks of compliant hemp-derived CBD brands across conventional retail channels. Through strategic partnerships with best-in-class sales agencies, this business unit provides comprehensive retail solutions to leading CBD brands. We believe our partnerships with leading CPG sales agencies is the first large scale go-to-market operation focused on helping compliant CBD brands achieve mass distribution across all consumer channels in legal U.S markets.
Our Corporate History and Background
KushCo Holdings, Inc. (“KushCo”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 26, 2014. On March 4, 2014, the stockholders of KIM International Corporation (“KIM”) exchanged all 10,000 of their common shares of KIM for 32,400,000 common shares of KushCo. The operations of KIM became the operations of KushCo after the share exchange and, accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of KIM, whereby the historical financial statements of KIM are presented as the historical financial statements of the combined entity.
Subsequent to the share exchange, the members of KIM owned 32,400,000 shares of our common stock, effectively obtaining operational and management control of KushCo. KushCo had no operations prior to the share exchange. As a result of the recapitalization, KIM was the acquiring entity in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The accumulated losses of KIM were carried forward after the completion of the share exchange. Operations prior to the share exchange were those of KIM.
On April 10, 2015, we entered into an equity purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Dank Bottles, LLC ("Dank"), a Colorado limited liability company. In exchange for the purchased interests, we paid cash consideration of $373,725 and issued 3,500,000 shares of common stock to the sellers of Dank.
On May 1, 2017, we and KBCMP, Inc., our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement of Merger with Lancer West Enterprises, Inc., a California corporation, Walnut Ventures, a California corporation, and certain individuals, pursuant to which each of Lancer West Enterprises, Inc. and Walnut Ventures were merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, resulting in our indirect acquisition of CMP Wellness, LLC (“CMP”), a California limited liability company and distributor of vaporizers, cartridges and accessories. CMP was dissolved on October 24, 2019.
On May 2, 2018, we and KCH Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“KCH”), completed our acquisition of Summit Innovations, LLC (“Summit”), a leading distributor of solvents to the legal cannabis industry. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Summit, Summit merged with and into KCH, with KCH as the surviving entity. KCH was subsequently renamed Kush Energy, LLC on January 2, 2019.
On July 11, 2018, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with the members of Zack Darling Creative Associates, LLC (“ZDCA”), parent of wholly-owned subsidiary, Hybrid Creative, LLC (“Hybrid”), a specialist design agency, whereby we purchased the entire issued membership interest of ZDCA. Following the acquisition, ZDCA operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, with Hybrid continuing to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZDCA.
On March 11, 2019, KCH Distribution Inc., dba Kush Supply Co. Canada was formed as the Canadian arm of KushCo’s business. 
Sales and Marketing 
We sell primarily into the business-to-business market, which includes brand owners, farmers, growers, processors, producers, distributors, and licensed retailers in states with legal medical and/or adult recreational use cannabis programs and legal CBD programs. We reach our large and diversified customer base through our direct sales force and our e-commerce website. Our 
operational personnel work closely with our sales personnel and customer service representatives to satisfy our customers’ needs through the distribution of high-quality products, on-time deliveries, value-added regulatory insight, and customized branding solutions and other services.
Our dedicated sales professionals maintain contact with existing clients and secure on-going orders, but also target new customers. We believe our “boots-on-the-ground” approach allows us to develop deep relationships with the key players in each major market and is vital in new emerging markets where value-add can be provided through educational and consultative sales messaging.
We are able to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products, customers and/or geographic regions, as needed, which enables us to develop expertise that is highly valued by our customers.
Our marketing activities include brand and logo development, advertising and marketing through trade shows, trade publications, social media, websites, public relations, other promotional materials, and all other points of contact with customers and prospective customers. 
Brand and Logo Development. We believe that we have built one of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the legal cannabis and CBD industries. We recognized early on the importance of creating a strong, identifiable and lasting brand that would separate our Company from the competition, and resonate with customers. Our logo, our name, the style of our ads, and all collateral material reflect our “brand image.”
Advertising & Marketing. We run ads periodically in certain trade publications and on specific websites that reach our target audience. We believe providing ongoing exposure to our brand and product offering enhances the value of our corporate brand. We maintain a list of our customers and prospects, and email them regularly. These campaigns may be seasonally based (such as holiday promotions) or may be “news” based to communicate important information to our customers and potential customers. Staying in touch with our customers and prospects is a key component in our marketing program.
Public Relations. We have an active public relations program, which has helped build the KushCo brand and position our Company not only as a leader in the industry, but as a company with an in-depth understanding of the various state and local regulations that govern the legal cannabis and CBD industries. We have appeared in numerous newspaper articles, online videos, digital media outlets, and television reports.
Other Promotional Materials. Our marketing personnel regularly design highly targeted brochures, sales sheets, and catalogs that we use in our sales and marketing programs. These professionally designed and quality-printed pieces help promote our Company while serving as useful sales tools.
Competition
We face competition from several competitors of varying sizes and geographic reach who produce and sell products similar to ours. We believe that we have differentiated ourselves from competitors based on several factors. We have built what we consider to be one of the strongest brands in the industry. We have a local sales presence in established and emerging medical and adult recreational use markets, such as Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Washington, as well as  Canada, which enable us to meet our customers’ demands at a speed and level of service that we believe surpasses that of the competition. We believe we have the highest quality and a comprehensive variety of products and services that meet our customers’ needs, given our status as a one-stop-shop solutions provider delivering a valuable product and service ecosystem. We believe we offer the best customized and branded packaging solutions in the market. Additionally, we believe our size and customer relationships give us significant insight and expertise in our industry. As a result, we have become more than just a supplier to our customers – we have become a trusted partner, with insight and recommendations that help our customers’ businesses grow and thrive. In addition, KushCo is committed to continuing to build its suite of proprietary and innovative products that are exclusive to the Company. 
Intellectual Property
We currently hold a collection of intellectual property rights relating to our products and services, including patents and trademarks, and we have several pending patent and trademark applications. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company's products and services. We believe the ownership of such intellectual property is important to help secure new customers, cross-sell more products to our existing customers, differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors and defend our competitive position. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.
Customers
We service customers across several industries including all areas of the legal cannabis and CBD supply chains including brand owners, farmers, growers, processors, producers, distributors, and licensed retailers. 
We have experienced growth in our large customer base as well as growth in the number of larger customers purchasing $500,000 or more per year. The table below shows our revenue (in thousands) for the years ended August 31, 2020 and 2019 from adult recreational use states in the United States, medical use only states in the United States, Canada and all other countries.

As the industry matures and as we continue to cross-sell deeper into our customer base, the size of our largest customers has increased by overall spend as well as by the number of items purchased. We believe this trend is likely to continue and will benefit our “one-stop-shop” strategy for our customers’ ancillary needs.
Our larger customers are purchasing an ever-increasing variety of products. Our ability to cross-sell SKUs allows us to secure improved pricing as a result of our increased scale and purchasing power, and enables us to develop deeper relationships with our customers.Customer ConcentrationWe had one customer which accounted for approximately 10% of revenue, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020. We had two customers, which accounted for approximately 14% and 10% of revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019.
Sources and Availability of Products
We source and purchase parts, products and accessories from different suppliers from time to time. We believe that we have maintained strong relationships with our suppliers. We expect that such relationships will continue into the foreseeable future, but we can provide no assurances that these relationships will continue. Based on our experience, we believe that adequate quantities of the raw materials that we use to manufacture our parts, products and accessories (e.g., plastic resins) will continue to be available at market prices, but we can provide no assurances as to such availability or the prices for such materials.
Segments
We operate as one operating segment. As defined in ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer), in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the last five years, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in the legal cannabis and CBD industries. However, the majority of our offerings operate similarly, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. 
Employees
As of the date of this filing, we have a total of 109 employees, of which 108 are considered full-time employees. Our employees work at our facilities located across the U.S. Our relations with employees remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes.
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages, including certain packages we sell pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. FDA can order a recall if the agency determines that there is a reasonable probability that the article is adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA and that the use of or exposure to such article will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition to federal law, states, cities and other countries in which we sell our products may impose similar laws. The majority of our products do not come into direct contact with food, as our customers typically package their food products in inner packaging, utilizing our products as an outer packaging.
Certain of our products are also regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The CPSC is the primary federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of and exposure to consumer products. Consumer products are widely defined and likely include the type of packaging products we produce. When the CPSC determines there is an undue risk of harm associated with exposure to or use of a regulated product, it has wide administrative powers to require investigation of the product as well as disclosure of information related to sales and distribution of the product. Ultimately, the CPSC can require injunctive measures (e.g., product recalls and product refunds) as well as separate monetary sanctions, which are determined after considering relevant equitable factors including but not limited to the severity of the harm, the level of knowledge or intent associated with the violation, any history of violations, etc.
The plastics industry, which includes us, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills and contain minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and limits on the use of plastic products. Certain states have also enacted legislation requiring products packaged in plastic containers to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance, however, that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
Thirty-four states, the District of Columbia and Canada currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. We do not believe that federal or any state laws prohibit us from selling our products or offering our services to cannabis operators. See, however, the risk factors in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the captions “Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and therefore, strict enforcement of U.S. federal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability and the inability of our customers to execute our respective business plans,” “States which have not approved any legal sale of marijuana may seek to 
overturn laws legalizing cannabis use in neighboring states, which if successful, could result in legal action against such neighboring states and have a significant negative effect on our business,” and “We and our customers may have difficulty accessing the services of financial institutions and related financial services, which may make it difficult to sell our products and services.”
Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and will continue to be an emerging growth company until August 31, 2021. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. As a result, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Corporate and Available Information
Our principal corporate offices are located at 6261 Katella Avenue, Suite 250, Cypress, California 90630 and our telephone number is (714) 243-4311. Our internet address is ir.kushco.com.

Our SEC reports can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website.
