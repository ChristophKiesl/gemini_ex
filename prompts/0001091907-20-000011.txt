All trademarks and trade names appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders.
We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for nearly 40 years, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We are principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including our premium over-the-top subscription network (“WWE Network”), content rights agreements, pay-per-view event programming, filmed entertainment, live events, licensing of various WWE themed products, and the sale of consumer products featuring our brands. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our distribution platforms provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans.
Based on the strength of the Company’s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent globally across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content, including our WWE Network, which is available in all international markets other than embargoed countries. 
Our operations are organized around the following principal activities:
Media:
The Media segment reflects the production and monetization of long-form and short-form video content across various platforms, including WWE Network, broadcast and pay television, digital and social media, as well as filmed entertainment. Across these platforms, revenues principally consist of content rights fees, subscriptions to WWE Network, and advertising and sponsorships. 
Live Events:
Live events provide ongoing content for our media platforms. Live Event segment revenues consist primarily of ticket sales, including primary and secondary distribution, revenues from events for which we receive a fixed fee, as well as the sale of travel packages associated with the Company’s global live events. 
Consumer Products:
The Consumer Products segment engages in the merchandising of WWE branded products, such as video games, toys and apparel, through licensing arrangements and direct-to-consumer sales. Revenues principally consist of royalties and licensee fees related to WWE branded products, and sales of merchandise distributed at our live events and through eCommerce platforms.
Media
Media net revenues were $743.1 million, $683.4 million and $535.6 million, representing 77%, 73% and 67% of total net revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Network
WWE Network launched in February 2014, becoming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming direct-to-consumer network. This subscription-based network is currently available in all international markets other than embargoed countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, China and Australia, among others. Subscribers can access all of WWE’s live pay-per-view events, exclusive original programming and nearly 11,000 hours of our video-on-demand library. The inclusion of our monthly marquis pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania, and the access to original content and live specials are critical components of the programming which drives our viewer engagement and satisfaction. WWE Network content includes exclusive original programming, groundbreaking documentaries, reality shows and in-ring specials, including WWE Starrcade, The Bump and WWE:24. Our strategy of creating compelling original content for broadcast on WWE Network has contributed to the popularity of WWE Network, which premiered over 340 hours of original content during 2019. 
WWE Network is available on select gaming consoles, computers, mobile devices, internet connected TVs, and popular digital media players. As of December 31, 2019, WWE Network had 1,391,000 paid subscribers as compared to 1,528,100 subscribers at 

 

December 31, 2018, representing a 9% decline in our subscriber base. For domestic subscribers, the current subscription pricing of WWE Network is $9.99 per month with no minimum commitment, and new subscribers are currently offered a one-month free trial. 
Core Content Rights Fees
Leveraging our expertise in live event television production, we now produce seven hours of original weekly domestic television programming, RAW, SmackDown and NXT, our core content. RAW and NXT are licensed domestically under a multi-year contract with NBC Universal (“NBCU”), while SmackDown moved to broadcast television on the Fox Network. Second runs of RAW and SmackDown are also available on WWE Network 30 days after the original first run airing dates on television.
RAW is a three-hour live primetime program which ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW remains the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime television history, with nearly 1,400 original episodes, and anchors USA Network’s programming line-up, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable entertainment network.
SmackDown is a two-hour live show airing on Fridays on Fox Network. SmackDown continues to be the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, second only to RAW. 
NXT moved to USA Network in September 2019 and is now airing live for two hours on Wednesday nights. Prior to airing on USA Network, the weekly NXT programs were exclusively available on WWE Network. The weekly program continues to air on WWE Network shortly after the initial run on USA Network.

Our international broadcast partners currently include: BT Sport in the United Kingdom; Sony Ten in India, Rogers Communication in Canada, and PPTV in China, among many others. 
Advertising and Sponsorships
WWE utilizes the Internet and social media platforms to promote our brands, market and distribute our content and digital products, create a community experience among our fans and sell advertising across these various platforms. WWE currently streams its media content on select social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook. WWE surpassed 50 million subscribers on YouTube, and consistently ranks among the top viewed channels, with nearly 21 billion views of WWE content in 2019. The Company receives advertising revenues from YouTube and Facebook based on viewership data of our content. In 2019, WWE had 1.2 billion social media fan engagements across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Tumblr.
Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of 8 million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 2019. These visitors viewed an average of 120 million pages and 9 million video streams per month. WWE wallpapers, ringtones, voicetones and videos are available through our mobile partnerships. WWE currently has local language-based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. Currently, the available languages are English, Mandarin, French, German, Polish and Arabic. We have relationships with sales agencies in global markets to sell advertising on WWE.com, which allow our partners to sell advertising across multiple countries.
In addition, through our sponsorship packages, we offer advertisers a full range of our promotional opportunities, including online and print advertising, on-air announcements and special appearances by our Superstars. These opportunities allow our advertisers and sponsors to engage consumers across a variety of our platforms. In 2019, we grew several partnerships with blue-chip brands, including Hyundai, Mars, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Microsoft and KFC. Our transition of SmackDown to Fox Network also enabled us to partner with new advertisers, such as Amazon, Facebook, Taco Bell and Walmart. Our sponsors promote their products utilizing our digital media assets, including promotion on WWE.com as well as promotion through WWE Network and through our live events.
Other
Our Media segment also generates revenue from the distribution of other WWE content, including, but not limited to, certain live in-ring programming content in international markets, scripted, reality and other programming, as well as theatrical and direct-to-home video releases.

In 2019, we launched two podcasts, After the Bell and The New Day: Feel The Power, in partnership with Endeavor Audio, which both debuted within the top three on Apple podcasts. We also launched localized programming in India, China, the Middle East and Latin America. Additionally, our partnership with Mattel enabled us to create original kids content on YouTube, which garnered more than 50 million views.
Live Events
Live Events net revenues were $125.6 million, $144.2 million and $151.7 million, representing 13%, 16% and 19% of total net revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our broad and talented roster of Superstars allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international demand for our events. Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events which air on WWE Network and are also available via pay-per-view.
Our annual WrestleMania event, which was held in April 2019, sold out MetLife Stadium with more than 82,000 fans in attendance and was the second highest-grossing event in WWE history. The NXT TakeOver: New York event held during WrestleMania week was the highest-grossing NXT event in our history.
North American Ticket Sales
In 2019, we produced 260 live events (excluding NXT) throughout North America, entertaining 1.3 million fans at an average ticket price of $64.21. We hold many of our live events at major arenas across the country. In addition to providing content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters.
International Ticket Sales
In 2019, we produced 50 live events (excluding NXT) internationally, reaching 226,000 fans at an average ticket price of $81.18. These events were spread over several international tours throughout Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and Australia. 
Consumer Products
Consumer Products net revenues were $91.7 million, $102.6 million and $113.7 million, representing 10%, 11% and 14% of total net revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Consumer Product Licensing
We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of retail products, including video games, toys, apparel and books. Currently, we have relationships with more than 200 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business. 
Video games and toys are the largest components of our licensing program. We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc. our master toy licensee, covering all global territories and a multi-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") to produce and sell our branded console video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K, available on PlayStation and XBOX platforms and on iOS and Android devices and WWE SuperCard which is available on iOS and Android devices. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games toward downloadable content through an Internet connected device. Accordingly, our video games can be downloaded via the Internet and contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enhance game play.
Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record music, including Superstar entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performed by popular artists.

 


eCommerce
WWEShop is our direct-to-consumer e-commerce storefront. WWE merchandise is also distributed on other domestic and international e-commerce platforms, including Amazon. We processed 619,700 orders during 2019 as compared to 786,800 in 2018.
Venue Merchandise
Our direct-to-consumer venue merchandise business consists of the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of numerous WWE-branded products such as t-shirts, belts, caps and other novelty items, all of which feature our Superstars and/or logos.
Customers
Our customers include content distributors of our media content through their networks and platforms, fans who purchase tickets to our live events, purchase our merchandise at venues or online through our eCommerce platforms and subscribers to WWE Network, advertisers and sponsors, consumer product licensees, and film distributors/buyers. As noted elsewhere, we have several important partners, including NBCU who carries the domestic television distribution of Raw and NXT, Fox Network who domestically distributes SmackDown, and the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who, among other things, hosts our live events in the Middle East.
Creative Development and Production
Headed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent K. McMahon, our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company’s reputation for family friendly entertainment.
Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars. We currently have approximately 300 Superstars under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars to developmental contracts with our Superstars in training. Our Superstars are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars.
Talent Development
We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our NXT division, which features developmental talent training to become WWE Superstars, has produced approximately 70% of our current active main roster stars, such as Bray Wyatt, Bayley, The Revival, Shinsuke Nakamura, and Carmella. NXT has now evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a weekly live television series, as well as global touring brand broadcasting live specials on WWE Network throughout the year. In 2019, we continued our focus on recruiting international talent with tryouts in India, China and Canada, as well as three tryouts at our Performance Center in Florida. These efforts have resulted in approximately 60% of our developmental talent coming from outside the U.S., including the United Kingdom, China, India, Japan, Australia, Ireland, Brazil and Germany. NXT talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and has become the center of our talent development program. In efforts to localize our content around the world, we opened the WWE UK Performance Center in January 2019, which is the first WWE training facility outside of the United States. 
Competition
While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live event and media content audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, which includes other professional wrestling leagues, and other leisure activities. We will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content, as streamed media offerings continue to expand. For purchases of our merchandise, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties’ intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art. We also own a large 

 

number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide.
We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results.
Employees
As of February 2020, we had 960 employees. This headcount excludes our Superstars and NXT talent, who are independent contractors. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a union.
Regulation
Live Events
In some United States and foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Television and WWE Network Programming
The marketplace for audio-visual programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. Certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations are imposed directly on the Company and/or indirectly through our distributors. Other domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance. In October 2019, the domestic distribution of our program, SmackDown, moved to broadcast television on the Fox Network which resulted in our being responsible, directly or indirectly, for compliance with certain additional FCC regulations and statutory requirements. Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies or regulations and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and, in the case of government regulation, result in monetary liability. Such failure could also adversely affect our levels of viewership and/or number of WWE Network subscribers. Any of these could affect our operating results.
