Item 1. Business (Restated)
Overview
 
Pareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a rapidly growing cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing) ™.
 
Millions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum’s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum’s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (“IoT”), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.
 
With estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum’s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.
 
The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our self-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward.  We have approximately 73 patents granted in relation to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions.  Our platform services partners (technologies integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.
 
Pareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower “Every Person and Every(Thing)” to be globally connected, hence our slogan – ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE™. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO), Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS), which Pareteum delivers.
 
Coronavirus Pandemic
 
In March 2020, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that could impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chain to support these activities. We expect operating and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.
 
We see an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries remain negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we see slowed sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contract signatures or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services that we offer.

Innovative Use Cases
 
Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the platforms of Pareteum are designed to enable any of the following, among others:

Ø | Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ø | Connected cars 
Ø | Smart cities 
Ø | Smart logistics and supply chains 
Ø | Smart healthcare applications 

 
In addition to the foregoing, as a result of certain acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios, which it now manages through various wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Acquired IP Rights”). The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.
 
Business Model
 
At Pareteum, our mission is to “Empower CSP’s, Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own (wireless) communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.” We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.
 
However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a “network effect”. The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.
 
To achieve our desired growth, we are using our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering Mobility, Engagement, Intelligence and Control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.
 
Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy
 
Pareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the 2018 acquisition of Artilium.
 
Pareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2020 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.
 
Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:
 

Phase 1: | We continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs. 
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 2: | We will continue to on-board new communication services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pac). 
---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 3: | We will drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more “things” (whether SIM cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets). 
---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 4: | At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights. 
---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth and this highlights our strategy for accelerating the world’s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we’re successful, we believe it might accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.
 
We also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:
 

• | Exploring cross and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum’s recent customer acquisitions – focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplements their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platform evolution – enhance and expand existing products and services; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic expansion—in this area, focusing on entering new markets such as South East Asia and Latin America. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 140 full and part-time employees worldwide. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 218 full and part-time employees worldwide.
 
Research & Development
 
Pareteum’s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. We have announced innovation in e-commerce, machine learning and predictive analytics, all supported by our growing Pareteum application exchange and development community. Enabling our CPaaS with identity management, transaction settlements and payment solutions greatly expands the opportunity for our customers and revenue streams for the Company. Product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $3,082,956 and $1,479,587, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
Pareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has two granted patents for inventions embedded in its communications platforms, and with the addition of Artilium and iPass has a patent portfolio of some 73 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking and systems and methods for network curation, all expiring throughout 2034, and subject to renewals.
 
Pareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
 
Sales & Marketing
 
Pareteum’s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.
 
We engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product and technical decision makers responsible for the end user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.

Customers
 
Our customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.
 
A customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of handoff from sales to service is handled by this distinct team which is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.
 
Pareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24x7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum’s customers. Customers which use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value the network reliability and availability, and responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.
 
The Company has a significant customer and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this significant customer accounted for approximately 20% and 64% of our revenues.
 
Competition
 
We compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications’ platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.
 
We believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:
 

· | the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the price at which others offer competitive software and services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
 
The CPaaS market is moving quickly. The Company believes that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:
 

§ | Scale and international reach of connectivity
--+----------------------------------------------


§ | Comprehensiveness of platform offerings
--+----------------------------------------


§ | Ease of deployment and implementation
--+--------------------------------------


§ | Scalability and reliability of service
--+---------------------------------------

 
Pareteum considers itself well placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the segments where it competes:
 

§ | MVNE services for Communication Service Providers (CSP): In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

§ | Wi-Fi Connectivity aggregation for Enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more outdoor, hotels, airports, business and leisure areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | SMS A2P for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable B2C messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple API integration. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Nevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.
 
One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:
 

§ | Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g. business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (“M2M”) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen GSM and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.

Regulatory
 
Pareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
