 ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
 Our Business
 We believe we are the fifth largest asset‑based truckload carrier in the United States by revenue, generating over $1.7 billion in total operating revenue in 2019. We provide services primarily throughout the United States, with a focus in the densely populated and economically diverse eastern half of the United States. We offer customers a broad portfolio of services using our own truckload fleet and third‑party carriers through our non‑asset‑based truck brokerage network. As of December 31, 2019, our fleet consisted of approximately 6,900 tractors and approximately 15,500 trailers, including approximately 2,000 tractors provided by independent contractors. All of our tractors have been equipped with electronic logs since 2012, and our systems and network are engineered for compliance with the federal electronic log mandate. Our terminal network is established and capable of handling significantly larger volumes without meaningful additional investment. In June 2018, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”).
 For much of our history, we focused primarily on scaling our fleet and expanding our service offerings to support sustainable, multi‑faceted relationships with customers. More recently, we have focused on our core service offerings and refined our network to focus on shorter, more profitable lanes with more density, which we believe are more attractive to drivers. Over the last five years, we have recruited and developed new executive and operational management teams with significant industry experience and instilled a new culture of professional management. These changes, which are ongoing, helped us to maintain relatively stable profitability during the weak truckload market of 2016 and early 2017, and drive significant improvements to profitability during the strong truckload market beginning in the second half of 2017.
 Our Service Offerings
 We organize our service offerings into two reportable segments, Truckload and Brokerage. The Truckload segment offers asset‑based truckload services, including the over-the-road (“OTR”) and dedicated contract services described below. Our Brokerage segment is principally engaged in non‑asset‑based freight brokerage services. We believe many customers seek truckload operators that offer both asset‑based and non‑asset‑based services to help ensure capacity will be available as needed. We believe that each of our service offerings, on a stand‑alone revenue basis, would represent one of the largest participants in its respective market.
 Below is a brief overview of our service offerings:
    
 | | Approximate% of 2019Revenue(1) | Description 
----------------+-----+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truckload (85%) | OTR | 48% | Transports a full trailer of freight for a single customer from origin to destination, typically without intermediate stops or handling Short-term contracts and spot moves that include irregular route moves without volume and capacity commitments Tractors are operated with one driver or a team of two drivers to handle more time-sensitive, higher margin freight Routes are generally between 450 and 1,050 miles in length Fuel surcharge programs help us offset most of the negative impact of rising fuel prices associated with loaded or billed miles

Brokerage | 12% | Non-asset-based freight brokerage service through which loads are contracted to third-party carriers Allocation strategy designed to maximize profitability of our Truckload fleet before outsourcing loads to third-party carriers In the past 12 months, we have utilized the capacity of approximately 25,000 third-party carriers 


 (1)Based on revenue, before fuel surcharge. Approximately 3% of revenue is attributable to other ancillary services.
 While we primarily operate in the eastern half of the United States, we provide services into and out of Mexico. In January 2019, we sold our interest in Xpress Internacional. Even following our sale of Xpress Internacional, we expect to have business to and from Mexico via a more variable cost model using third party carriers.  During 2019, 2018 and 2017, substantially all of our operating revenue was generated in the United States.
 Customer Relationships
 We maintain a diverse, long‑standing customer base that includes many Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, FedEx, Home Depot, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Target, Tractor Supply and Walmart. Our customers fall within a broad spectrum of geographies and end markets, including retail, food and beverage, e‑commerce and packages, manufacturing and consumer products. No other category comprised more than five percent of the end markets we served at December 31, 2019. Relationships with our top ten customers exceed ten years on average. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer, Walmart Inc., accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue, excluding fuel surcharge. Tractor and Trailer Fleets
 We operate a modern fleet of approximately 4,900 company‑owned tractors and approximately 15,500 trailers, and we also contract for additional tractor capacity through approximately 2,000 independent contractors, who provide both the tractor and a driver and, except for the trailer, which we generally provide, bear the operating expenses of each load. Our company tractor fleet continues to adopt the most advanced technology in today’s market including electronic logging devices (“ELDs”), electronic speed limiters, electronic roll stability, improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency technologies, enhanced tractor connectivity with remote updating capabilities, improved automatic transmissions, lane departure and collision warning / avoidance systems and upgraded braking systems. Each of our company tractors is also equipped with onboard communication units that offer real time freight positioning to our customers and instant communication between our drivers and us, and event recorders. We believe event recorders will give us the ability to better train our drivers with respect to safe driving behavior, which in turn may help reduce insurance costs over time.
 Tractors and trailers represent our most substantial capital investments. In general, we expect to operate a tractor for approximately 475,000 miles, which when averaged across our fleet as of December 31, 2019 equates to approximately 4.5 years of operation (while most major components are under warranty) and a trailer for up to 10 years or more of operation. We depreciate or finance our equipment over their useful lives and down to salvage values that we expect to 

 
  Page 5
 
represent fair market value at the expected time of sale. Our ongoing capital expenditures are significant, and our annual depreciation expense is expected to be approximately equal to maintenance capital expenditures, net of proceeds of dispositions, assuming a constant percentage of leased versus owned equipment and a constant trade cycle. In practice, we vary our trade cycle and financing based on the market for new and used tractors, the quality, dependability and cost per mile to operate the equipment, our capital budget, expected tax benefits and other factors. Based on the volumes we purchase, we believe that we have a cost advantage in the procurement of new tractors and trailers compared to the prices paid by small trucking companies.
 Our company tractors had an average age of approximately 1.7 years at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we expect to continue to replace tractors as they reach approximately 475,000 miles, which we expect will result in an average tractor age of approximately 1.6 years at December 31, 2020.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following competitive strengths provide us with a strong foundation to continue to improve our profitability and stockholder value:
 Industry leading truckload operator with significant scale
 We believe we are the fifth largest asset‑based truckload carrier in the United States in 2019 by total operating revenue and we believe our large scale provides us with significant benefits. These benefits include economies of scale on major expenditures such as tractors, trailers and fuel, as well as our overall infrastructure. Additionally, we can offer an enhanced value proposition for large customers who seek efficiency in sourcing capacity from a limited number of carriers and flexible capacity to accommodate seasonal surge volumes. Our established and well‑maintained terminal network is capable of handling meaningfully larger volumes without meaningful additional investment.
 Complementary mix of services to afford flexibility and stability throughout economic cycles
 Our service offerings have unique characteristics and are subject to differing market forces, which we believe allows us to respond effectively through economic cycles.
 OTR
 OTR business involves short‑term customer contracts without pricing or volume guarantees that allow us to benefit from periods of supply and demand imbalance and price volatility. This is the largest part of our business and the overall truckload market. Dedicated
 Dedicated business features committed rates, lanes and volumes under contracts that generally afford us greater revenue predictability over the contract period and help smooth the impact of market cycles. Additionally, our dedicated contract service offering generally has higher driver retention rates than our OTR service offering, which we believe is because our professional drivers prefer the more predictable time at home that dedicated routes offer. In addition, this increased visibility allows us to commit and invest fleet resources with a more predictable return profile. We intend to grow this portion of our business as a percentage of our average tractors. Brokerage
 Brokerage capacity allows us to aggregate volume and to flex the amount allocated to our own fleet with freight cycles. Typically, we allocate more loads to our OTR fleet during slow freight demand to keep our assets productive, and more loads to third‑party carriers during higher freight demand to maintain control over customer freight and make a margin on outsourcing the moves. By retaining control over significantly more freight than we are able to serve with our own assets, and allocating the available loads first to our own tractors, we have more choices for optimizing the utilization and pricing of our fleet every day and throughout market cycles.

 Long‑standing, diverse and resilient customer base
 We maintain a long‑standing customer base that includes many Fortune 500 companies with national footprints, including Amazon, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, FedEx, Home Depot, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Target, Tractor Supply and Walmart. As of December 31, 2019, relationships with our top ten customers exceeded ten years on average. Our portfolio of blue‑chip customers allows us to benefit from the less cyclical and more‑stable demand from grocery and dollar stores in addition to increasing demand due to secular growth trends in end‑markets such as e‑commerce. We also benefit from significant cross‑selling opportunities among large key customers, as all of our top ten customers use at least two of our three service offerings, which allows us to have multiple points of contact with our customers and take advantage of varying bid cycles.
 Modern fleet and maintenance system designed to optimize life cycle investment and minimize operating costs
 Our fleet represents our largest capital investment, a visible representation of our brand for customers and drivers and a large portion of our controllable costs. We select, maintain and dispose of our fleet based on rigorous analysis of our investments and operating costs.
 Our modern and well‑maintained fleet consisted of approximately 4,900 company tractors with an average age of approximately 1.7 years and approximately 15,500 trailers at December 31, 2019. We also contracted for approximately 2,000 tractors provided by independent contractors at December 31, 2019. We equip our tractors with carefully selected components based on initial cost, maintenance requirements, warranty coverage, safety and efficiency advantages, driver preference and resale value. Our company tractor fleet is technologically advanced and equipped with safety and efficiency features, including using electronic logs since 2012, electronic speed limiters, automatic transmissions, lane departure and collision warning systems, air disc brakes and high performance wide brake drums and electronic roll stability. In addition, we have installed forward‑facing event recorders in our company tractors, which we expect to further enhance our safety program and reduce insurance and claims costs over time.
 Over the past several years, we have developed a disciplined and effective in‑house maintenance program designed to actively manage these assets based on customized timetables for preventive maintenance and replacement of parts. We believe this approach, coupled with our in‑house maintenance facilities and in‑house technicians dedicated to fleet maintenance, helps us effectively manage our maintenance cost per mile, keeps drivers on the road efficiently and creates an attractive asset and record for resale.
 Motivated management team focused on tactical execution and leadership in the truckload market
 Our management and operations team has been carefully assembled to obtain a mix of industry veterans from successful competitors and high‑performing internal candidates, all of whom are motivated to perform in our transparent, metric‑driven environment. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Fuller, has over 20 years of experience at U.S. Xpress and has been responsible for developing the team and spearheading our transformation program over the last five years. Our management team’s compensation and ownership of our common stock provide further incentive to improve business performance and profitability. In addition, with active positions in industry associations, such as the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (“ATA”), our management team provides us with a key role in the discussions that we believe are shaping the future of the industry. We believe our leadership team is well‑positioned to execute our strategy and remains a key driver of our financial and operational success.
 Our Strategies
 We believe we possess the scale, infrastructure and service offerings to compete effectively in our markets, our opportunity for further improvement is significant, and our strategies are designed to enhance stockholder value.

 Company Drivers
 Professional truck drivers are the backbone of our success and the heart of the Company. Responsibility for driver retention flows throughout our organization and every office and maintenance employee is expected to take the necessary steps to keep our drivers satisfied and productive. Keeping our drivers satisfied and safe is the guiding principle behind our modern fleet, training programs and driver compensation. Company drivers are eligible to participate in our health care plan and certain voluntary plans, including life insurance and disability plans, dental and vision plans and our 401(k) plan.
 Our drivers are subject to certain hiring guidelines related to driving history, accident and safety history, physical standards and drug and alcohol testing. Upon meeting certain criteria, applicants are invited to attend an orientation at one of our service centers. The on‑site orientation is focused on introducing a driver to the concepts and training necessary to be a successful, professional driver, including training related to safety, life on the road, our operations and equipment and electronic log operation. The on‑site orientation also includes a road test.
 Independent Contractors
 In addition to the company drivers that we employ, we enter into contracts with independent contractors. Independent contractors operate their own tractors (although some employ drivers they hire) and provide their services to us under contractual arrangements. Except for generally providing independent contractors with the use of our trailers, they are 

  Page 8
 
responsible for the ownership and operating expenses and are compensated by us primarily on a rate per mile basis. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. We believe that the fleet of independent contractors we engage provides significant advantages that primarily arise from the motivation of business ownership. Independent contractors tend to produce more miles per tractor per week. As of December 31, 2019, the approximately 2,000 independent contractors we engage comprised approximately 28% of our available capacity, as measured by tractor count.
 Services offered to independent contractors include insurance, maintenance and fuel. Through our wholly owned insurance captive subsidiary, Xpress Assurance, Inc. (“Xpress Assurance”), independent contractors can purchase occupational accident, physical damage and other types of insurance. Independent contractors also are able to procure at their expense fuel and maintenance services at our truckload service centers.
 Employment
 As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 8,572 employees, of whom approximately 6,298 were drivers, approximately 316 were maintenance technicians and approximately 1,958 were office employees, including operations staff, sales and marketing, recruiting, safety and other support personnel. None of our domestic employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Insurance
 We retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses associated with third party bodily injury and property damage, employee medical expenses, workers’ compensation, physical damage to our equipment and cargo loss. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We currently carry the following material types of insurance, which generally have the retention amounts, maximum benefits per claim and other limitations noted:
 commercial automobile liability excess coverage approximately $300.0 million of coverage per occurrence subject to a $3.0 million retention per occurrence with annual aggregate limits within the $3.0 to $10.0 million layer of $14.0 million and a three-year policy aggregate of $28.0 million;
 general liability, business auto liability and excess employer’s liability coverage: approximately $300.0 million of coverage per occurrence subject to a $25,000 deductible per occurrence for general liability claims, $50,000 deductible per occurrence for business auto claims and $500,000 deductible for excess employer’s liability:
 cargo damage and loss: $2.0 million limit per tractor or trailer subject to a $250,000 retention per occurrence;
 workers’ compensation/employers’ liability: statutory coverage limits subject to a $500,000 retention for each accident or disease;
 employment practices and wage and hour liability: $25.0 million aggregate limit in coverage subject to a $1.0 million retention for employment practices and $2.5 million retention for wage and hour for either a single claim or a class action;
 directors’ and officers’ insurance: $75.0 million aggregate limit of coverage subject to a $1.0 million retention with various sub-limits;
 fiduciary liability policy: $10.0 million aggregate limit of coverage subject to a $10,000 retention;
 employee healthcare: we retain each employee health care claim and maintain stop loss insurance of $1.0 million;
 crime insurance: $5.0 million of coverage subject to a $100,000 retention; and
 underground storage tank liability: $5.0 million in coverage with deductibles ranging from $25,000 to $75,000.

 Regulation
 Transportation Regulations
 Our operations are regulated and licensed by various government agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Department of Homeland security (“DHS”). These and other federal and state agencies also regulate our equipment, operations, drivers and third‑party carriers.
 The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours‑of‑service. Changes to such hours‑of‑service rules can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our drivers may operate and/or disrupting our network. However, in August 2019, the FMCSA issued a proposal to make changes to its hours-of-service rules that would allow truck drivers more flexibility with their 30-minute rest break and with dividing their time in the sleeper berth. It also would extend by two hours the duty time for drivers encountering adverse weather, and extend the shorthaul exemption by lengthening the drivers’ maximum on-duty period from 12 hours to 14 hours.  It is unclear how long the process of finalizing a final rule will take, if one does come to fruition.  Any future changes to hours‑of‑service rules could materially adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating for our U.S. operations under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit,” and a carrier would be deemed fit when no rating was assigned. Moreover, the proposed rules would use roadside inspection data in addition to investigations and onsite reviews to determine a carrier’s safety fitness on a monthly basis. Under the current rules, a safety rating can only be given upon completion of a comprehensive onsite audit or review. Under the proposed rules, a carrier would be evaluated each month and could be given an “unfit” rating if the data collected from roadside inspections, investigations and onsite reviews did not meet certain standards. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period extending into May 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers have expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (the “FAST Act”), and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the Compliance, Safety, Accountability program (“CSA”) scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when or under what form any such rule could be implemented. The FMCSA also recently indicated its intent to perform a new study on the causation of crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be undertaken and completed, the results of such a study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regards to safety and fitness.
 In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety‑related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high‑quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores or (v) increase our insurance expenses, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 Under the CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the 

 
  Page 10
 
FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In late June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if, when and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could materially adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the DHS and other federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Safety Administration requires that each driver who applies for or renews his or her license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat. This requirement has reduced the pool of qualified drivers who are permitted to transport hazardous materials. These regulations also could complicate the matching of available equipment with hazardous material shipments, thereby increasing our response time and our empty miles on customer shipments. As a result, we could possibly fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In November 2015, the FMCSA published its final rule related to driver coercion, which took effect in January 2016. Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including hours‑of‑service rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense.
 The final rule requiring the use of ELDs was published in December 2015. This rule requires drivers of commercial motor vehicles that are required to keep logs to be ELD‑compliant by December 2017. Enforcement of this rule was  phased in, as states did not begin putting tractors out of service for non‑compliance until April 1, 2018. However, on a state‑by‑state basis, carriers were subject to citations for non‑compliance with the rule after the December 2017 compliance deadline. For those carriers who had automatic onboard recording devices (“AOBRDs”) installed prior to the December 2017 compliance deadline, the deadline to be fully compliant is December 2019. We currently use AOBRDs and were fully converted to ELDs by the December 2019 deadline. We do not believe that the conversion from AOBRDs to ELDs will have any material impact on our operations. However, we believe that more effective hours‑of‑service enforcement under this rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours‑of‑service requirements.
 In December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers will be required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective on January 4, 2017, with a compliance date of January 6, 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver’s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver’s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading or transferring a CDL. This new action will allow states’ compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023. That being said, the FMCSA has indicated it will allow states the option to voluntarily query Clearinghouse information beginning January 2020. The compliance date of January 2020 remained in place for all other requirements set forth in the Clearinghouse final rule, however. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market.
 Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016, and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver‑training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020 (FMCSA officials have recently reported, however, that they are delaying implementation of the final rule by two years). In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In 2019, U.S. Congressional representatives proposed a similar rule related to speed-limiting devices. The effect of these rules, to the 

 
  Page 11
 
extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In March 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that California state wage and hour laws are not preempted by federal law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari in May 2015, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stood. However, in December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the ATA and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups, and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision, and thus it’s uncertain whether it will stand. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Corporation and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in our industry, are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
 Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors and our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees’ overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long‑standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors and impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. 
 Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged “ABC Test” must be used to determine worker classification in wage-order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee—and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all 3 of the following criteria:

· | the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the worker is performing work outside the usual course of the business of the hiring company; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. While it was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) moves forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. While this preliminary injunction provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
 Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of

independent contractor status. If independent contractors we contract with are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Environmental Regulations
 From time to time we engage in the transportation of hazardous substances. Additionally, some of our tractor terminals are located in areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have wash facilities, waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) and the EPA adopted a new rule that established the first‑ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy‑duty vehicles, including the tractors we employ (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium‑and heavy‑duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. We believe these requirements will result in additional increases in new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit our tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings, but we cannot predict the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre‑emission‑rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined as the EPA continues to consider congressionally requested investigations into the legality of the proposal and the merits of an anti-glider study that was published four days after the proposal became official. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, Inc. regarding the Phase 2 Standards.
 In January 2020, the EPA announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA is aiming to release proposed standards for the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” later in 2020, and may take final action as soon as 2021. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect. 
 The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy‑duty tractors that pull 53‑foot or longer box‑type trailers within the State of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low‑rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay‑approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for 2011 model year equipment began in January 2010 and have been phased in over several years for older equipment. In order to comply with the CARB regulations, we submitted a large fleet compliance plan to CARB in June 2010. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed California Phase 2 standards that would generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards, with some minor additional requirements, and as proposed would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 Standards are affected by action from President Trump’s administration. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final. Thus, even if the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 Standards are permanently removed, we would still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards, which may result in increased equipment costs and could adversely affect our operating results and profitability. CARB has also recently announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that 100% of tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines

in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. We will continue monitoring our compliance with the CARB regulations. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate‑change proposals. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that will operate in California, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre‑2011 model year trailers that operate in California and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel‑powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on‑board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter its drivers’ behavior, which could result in increased costs.
 In addition to the foregoing laws and regulations, our operations are subject to other federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, many of which are implemented by the EPA and similar state agencies. Such laws and regulations generally govern the management and handling of hazardous materials, discharge of pollutants into the air, surface water and other environmental media, and groundwater preservation and disposal of certain various substances. We do not believe that our compliance with these statutory and regulatory measures has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Food Safety Regulations
 In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements and training related to the foregoing items. These requirements will take effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017. The FSMA is applicable to us not only as a carrier, but we are also considered a shipper when acting in the role of broker. We believe we have been in compliance with the FSMA since the compliance date. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Executive and Legislative Climate
 The regulatory environment has changed under the administration of President Trump. In January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year. In December 2019, the DOT announced a final rule indicating it is codifying this directive on our industry. This rule and any other anti‑regulatory action by the President and/or Congress may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how we may be impacted in the future by existing, proposed or repealed regulations.
 The United States Mexico Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) has been ratified by the United States and Mexico but must be ratified by the Parliament of Canada before it enters into effect.  The USMCA is designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry.  However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, if the USMCA enters into effect, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement and patterns of freight we transport.
 With the FAST Act set to expire in September 2020, Congress has noted its intent to consider a multiyear highway measure that would update the FAST Act. However, if Congress fails to reauthorize the FAST Act or pass updated replacement

legislation by the September 2020 deadline and proceeds to manage transportation policy via short-term legislative directives, there will be uncertainty that could have a negative impact on our operations.

 Seasonality
 In the trucking industry, revenue has historically decreased as customers reduce shipments following the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations. At the same time, operating expenses have generally increased, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather, causing more physical damage equipment repairs and insurance claims and costs. For the reasons stated, first quarter results historically have been lower than results in each of the other three quarters of the year. Over the past several years, we have seen increases in demand at varying times, including surges between Thanksgiving and the year‑end holiday season. Available Information
