Wabash Management System
Our Wabash Management System (“WMS”) is a set of principles and standardized business processes for the purpose of achieving our strategic objectives. By codifying what makes our company great, the WMS drives focus on the interconnected processes that are critical for success across our business. WMS is based on forward planning and continuous capability evaluation as we simultaneously drive execution and breakthrough performance. WMS requires everyone to be an active contributor to our enterprise-wide lean efforts and enables growth through innovation and industry leading customer satisfaction and alliances. Our WMS principles underpin an ongoing improvement cycle that includes Strategic Planning and Deployment, Kaizen, and Daily Management. It is through this set of standards and thinking that we create a “One Wabash” approach to our customers, add new business capabilities, and enable profitable growth.
Our One Wabash organizational transformation began during the first quarter of 2020 with the introduction of value streams that align our resources and processes on serving the customer. Our One Wabash organizational structure enables long-term 
growth for the Company with an intense focus on value streams, streamlined processes, product innovation, and a consistent, superior experience for all customers who seek our solutions in the transportation, logistics and distribution markets. The value streams leverage the power of our processes to close the cycle of customer needs and customer fulfillment.
Impact of Coronavirus (“COVID-19”)
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world and has negatively impacted portions of the economy, disrupted supply chains, and created volatility in financial markets. COVID-19 caused government authorities throughout the world to implement stringent measures to attempt to help control the spread of the virus, including business shutdowns, travel restrictions, disallowing group events and gatherings, quarantines, "shelter-in-place" and "stay-at-home" orders, curfews, social distancing, and other measures. The adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on parts of our business, customers, and suppliers and caused challenges during 2020. Additional details regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, as well as information regarding human capital management actions taken by Wabash in response to the pandemic, can be found under the section titled "COVID-19 Update" included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and risks related to COVID-19 can be found under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operating Segments
We manage our business in three reportable segments: Commercial Trailer Products (“CTP”), Diversified Products (“DPG”), and Final Mile Products (“FMP”). Each of these reportable segments offers a diverse portfolio of industrial solutions for the end markets and industries that they serve.

Commercial Trailer Products | Diversified Products | Final Mile Products 
■ Dry and Refrigerated Van Trailers | ■ Tank Trailers and Truck-Mounted Tanks | ■ Truck-Mounted Dry Bodies

Commercial Trailer Products
Commercial Trailer Products designs and manufactures dry and refrigerated vans, platform trailers, and other transportation-related equipment. Commercial Trailer Products’ transportation equipment is marketed under the Wabash®, DuraPlate®, DuraPlateHD®, ArcticLite®, Transcraft®, and Benson® brands. Our DuraPlate® Cell Core technology is a modified DuraPlate® panel that reduces the weight of a conventional 53 foot DuraPlate® trailer by 300 pounds without sacrificing strength or durability. In addition, our refrigerated van offerings now include our advanced molded structural composite (“MSC”) technology. The MSC Reefer is up to 30% more thermally efficient than conventional refrigerated vans, and is lighter with greater strength and durability. CTP sells directly to many of the largest companies in the trucking industry, as well as through a network of independent dealers. The CTP segment also operates a wood flooring production facility that manufactures laminated hard wood oak products for van trailers.
Diversified Products
The Diversified Products segment has historically been comprised of four strategic business units: Tank Trailers, Process Systems, Composites, and Aviation and Truck Equipment (“AVTE”). During the fourth quarter of 2020 we sold our Beall® brand of tank trailers and associated assets, which was included in the Tank Trailers business unit. Also, in January 2019 we completed a transaction to divest the AVTE business unit.
The Tank Trailers business designs and manufactures liquid transportation systems, including stainless steel and aluminum tank trailers, for the North American chemical, dairy, food and beverage, and petroleum and energy service markets. Tank Trailers are marketed under the Walker Transport, Brenner® Tank, and Bulk International brands. Our Process Systems business designs and manufactures isolators, stationary silos, and downflow booths for the chemical, dairy, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and nuclear markets. Process Systems markets its product offerings under the Walker® Engineered Products and Extract Technology® brands. Our Composites business includes offerings under our DuraPlate® composite panel technology, which contains unique properties of strength and durability that can be utilized in numerous applications in addition to trailers and truck bodies. Leveraging our DuraPlate® panel technology, our Composites business has designed and manufactured numerous 
proprietary products, including a full line of aerodynamic solutions designed to improve overall trailer aerodynamics and fuel economy, most notably the DuraPlate® AeroSkirt®. In addition, we utilize our DuraPlate® technology in the production of truck bodies, overhead doors, foldable portable storage containers, truck boxes, decking systems, and other industrial applications. These products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers.
Final Mile Products
The Company added the Final Mile Products reportable segment following the acquisition of Supreme Industries, Inc. (“Supreme”) in September 2017. The FMP segment designs and manufactures cutaway, dry-freight, refrigerated, and stake bodies. This acquisition accelerated our growth and expanded our presence in the final mile space, with increased distribution paths and greater customer reach, and supports our mission to enable customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that help them move everything from first to final mile. Final Mile Product truck bodies are offered in aluminum, FiberPanel PW, FiberPanel HC, or DuraPlate®, and are marketed under Kold King®, Iner-City®, Spartan, as well as other Wabash brands that leverage our fleet-proven DuraPlate® technology utilized in dry van trailers. Our Final Mile Products also include our molded structural composite truck bodies and fiberglass reinforced plywood used on some of our truck bodies. In addition, our MSC technology is available in our truck body offerings. With the acquisition of Supreme, our truck body line was expanded to include Classes 2 through 5, allowing us to serve a large variety of end customers in the final mile space. The FMP segment sells both direct to customers and through a large independent dealer network.

Industry and Competition
Trucking in the U.S., according to the American Trucking Association (“ATA”), was estimated to be a $791.7 billion industry in 2019, representing approximately 80% of the total U.S. transportation industry revenue. This represents a slight decrease of 0.6% from ATA’s 2018 estimate. Furthermore, ATA estimates that approximately 72.5% of all domestic freight tonnage in 2019 was carried by trucks, and 304.9 billion miles were traveled by registered trucks in 2018. Trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported. To meet this continued high demand for freight, truck carriers will need to replace and expand their fleets, which typically results in increased trailer orders.
Transportation in the U.S., including trucking, is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles (excluding 2020’s softened demand worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic) over the last 20 years. In each of the last three cycles the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general U.S. economic downturn and the recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry, experiencing cycles in the early and late 90’s lasting approximately 58 and 67 months, respectively. Truck freight tonnage, according to ATA statistics, started declining year-over-year in 2006 and remained at depressed levels through 2009. The most recent cycle concluded in 2009, lasting a total of 89 months. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the period ending December 31, 2019 demonstrated six consecutive years of healthy demand in which there were total trailer shipments of approximately 269,000, 308,000, 286,000, 288,000, 323,000, and 328,000 for the years ending 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Consistent with our expectations and industry forecasters, 2020 brought softened demand that was worsened and magnified by the uncertainty and economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ACT Research Company (“ACT”), the current estimate for 2020 production is approximately 202,000 trailers, which is somewhat below normal replacement demand levels. However, ACT is estimating recovery in 2021 to more historically consistent production levels within the trailer industry of approximately 275,000 trailers. In addition, overall demand is expected to be in excess of replacement demand and industry specific indicators we track, including ATA’s truck tonnage index, carrier/fleet profitability, employment growth, housing and auto sectors, as well as the overall gross domestic product, continue to be positive indicators. Additional discussion and analysis is included under the section titled "Industry Trends" included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Trailer manufacturers compete primarily through the quality of their products, customer relationships, innovative technology, and price. We have observed others in the industry also pursue the development and use of composite sidewalls that compete directly with our DuraPlate® products. Our product development is focused on maintaining a leading position with respect to these products and on development of new products and markets, leveraging products across our segments such as MSC, as well as our expertise in the engineering and design of customized products.
Our Diversified Products segment, in most cases, participates in markets different than our historical core van and platform trailer product offerings. The customers and end markets that our Diversified Products segment serve are broader and more diverse than the trailer industry, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biotech, oil and gas, and specialty vehicle markets. In addition, our diversification efforts pertain to new and emerging markets and many of the products are driven by regulatory requirements or, in most cases, customer-specific needs.
Our Final Mile Products segment competes in the specialized vehicle industry, whereby there are only a few national competitors and many smaller, regional companies. Competitive factors include quality of product, lead times, geographic 
proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications. With our national presence, diverse product offerings, and broad customer relationships, we believe that we are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges presented.
Human Capital Resources and Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,800 full-time employees. Throughout 2020, essentially all of our active employees were non-union. Our temporary employees represented approximately 12% of our overall production workforce as of December 31, 2020.
We believe our commitment to our human capital resources is key to our mission to enable our customers to succeed with breakthrough ideas and solutions that help them move everything from first to final mile. In addition, our human capital resources are at the core of our Values and Leadership Principles. The Company’s executives, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Senior Leadership Team”), are responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy and the design of employee compensation and benefits programs. The Senior Leadership Team is also responsible for developing and integrating the Company’s diversity and inclusion roadmap. In addition, regular updates are provided to the Company’s Board of Directors and its committees on the operation and status of human capital trends and activities. Key areas of focus for the Company include:
▪Employee Engagement – We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on our culture through an annual employee engagement survey. Results of the survey are measured and analyzed to enhance the employee experience, promote employee retention, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization.
▪Talent Development – We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. Our formal offerings include tuition reimbursement, leadership development experiences, vocational training, and self-directed learning modules. In addition, Wabash National employees and dependents of employees are eligible for a variety of scholarships offered by Wabash National and the industry associations to which we belong. In 2019, we awarded 16 high school graduates with Wabash National scholarships totaling $120,000.
▪Focus on Safety – At Wabash National, safety is our number one value. We prioritize the safety of our employees, our customers, and our communities. We partner with other manufacturers in the industry to further promote safety by sharing best practices and ideas for implementing higher standards.
We provide ongoing safety training and development at our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. Our employees are encouraged to identify safety opportunities through our safety good catch program. The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. For example, a lagging indicator includes the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”). In 2019, the Company had a TRIR of 6.4 and there were no work-related fatalities. A leading metric we use is scoring from our Blueprint for Excellence, which assesses a facility’s overall safety program and identifies key areas of improvement. In 2020, Wabash National implemented a software platform to proactively mitigate safety risks by driving business decisions based on actionable insights and advanced analytics. In addition, we finished 2020 with best-ever TRIR performance of 3.8.
Our safety awards include:
◦2019 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Awards (New Lisbon, WI, and Portland, OR)
◦2018 Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association Plant Safety Award (San José Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico)
◦2017 Kentucky Governor’s Safety and Health Award (Cadiz, KY)

We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Such programs are designed to support employees' physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.
▪Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Wabash National is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and non-discriminatory at all levels, reflecting the diversity of our customers and the varied environments in which we conduct business around the globe. Recognizing, valuing, and fully leveraging our different perspectives and backgrounds to achieve our business goals demonstrates our inclusive culture and is one of our Leadership Principles. We need inclusion and diversity to achieve our targeted business results and fulfill our vision of being the innovation leader of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics and distribution industries. Openness to diversity widens our access to the best talent, and inclusion allows us to engage that talent fully. In addition, we focus on preventing pay imbalances among genders, including proactive adjustments to pay, titles, and/or benefits to prevent gender pay gaps.
▪Compensation and Benefits – We provide robust compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, these programs can include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, safety shoe and prescription safety glass programs, an employee assistance program, and tuition assistance, among many others.

The content on any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K unless expressly noted.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our core competitive strengths include, but are not limited to:
▪Long-Term Core Customer Relationships – We are the leading provider of trailers to a significant number of top tier trucking companies, generating a revenue base that has helped to sustain us as one of the market leaders. Our van products are preferred by many of the industry’s leading carriers. We are also a leading provider of liquid-transportation systems and engineered products and we have a strong customer base, consisting of mostly private fleets, and have earned a leading market position across many of the markets we serve. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of truck bodies, and we have a strong customer base of large national fleet leasing companies and large retailers.
▪Technology and Innovation – We continue to be recognized by the trucking industry as a leader in developing technology to provide value-added solutions for our customers that reduce trailer operating costs, improve revenue opportunities, and solve unique transportation problems. Throughout our history, we have been and we expect to continue to be a leading innovator in the design and production of trailers and related products. We have commercialized and launched DuraPlate® Cell Core, a modified DuraPlate® panel that reduces the weight of a conventional 53 foot DuraPlate® trailer by 300 pounds without compromising strength or durability. Our refrigerated van offerings now include MSC technology. In connection with our Cold Chain strategic initiative, the MSC Reefer is up to 30% more thermally efficient than conventional refrigerated vans, and is lighter with greater strength and durability. We will leverage this innovative technology in other facets of our business, such as the final mile space. We believe we also have an opportunity to apply our composite materials expertise within the electric vehicle space. 
During 2020, in combination with technologies from eNowTM and Carrier Transicold, we introduced a zero-emission composite refrigerated trailer. This innovative trailer is now commercially available and provides customers a zero-emission refrigerated transportation solution that is more energy efficient and has a lower operating cost.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2021 we entered into an agreement with Gruau SAS to manufacture their refrigerated van inserts. Gruau refrigerated inserts are superior to spray foam and are engineered to provide premium performance in the Cold Chain final mile market. These inserts hold temperature and eliminate issues with mold and degradation and are compliant with the Food Safety Modernization Act.
▪Significant Brand Recognition – We have been one of the most widely recognized brands in the industry and we participate broadly in the transportation industry through all of our business segments.
▪WMS and Enterprise Lean – Our Wabash Management System (“WMS”) is a set of principles and standardized business processes for the purpose of achieving our strategic objectives. By codifying what makes our company great, the WMS drives focus on the interconnected processes that are critical for success across our business. WMS is based on forward planning and continuous capability evaluation as we simultaneously drive execution and breakthrough performance. WMS requires everyone to be an active contributor to our enterprise-wide lean efforts and enables growth through innovation and industry leading customer satisfaction and alliances. Our WMS principles underpin an ongoing improvement cycle that includes Strategic Planning and Deployment, Kaizen, and Daily Management. It is through this set of standards and thinking that we create a “One Wabash” approach to our customers, add new business capabilities, and enable profitable growth.
Safety, quality, delivery, cost, morale, and environment are the core elements of our program of continuous improvement. We currently maintain an ISO 14001 registration of the Environmental Management System at four facilities, which include our Lafayette, Indiana; Cadiz, Kentucky; San José Iturbide, Mexico; and Harrison, Arkansas locations. In addition, we have achieved ISO 9001 registration of the Quality Management Systems at our Lafayette, Indiana, Cadiz, Kentucky, and Huddersfield, England facilities.
▪Corporate Culture – As further described above in the “Human Capital Resources and Management” section, we believe strong human capital acts as a competitive differentiator and our focus is not only on ensuring we have the right leaders in place to drive our strategic initiatives today, but also to nurture our talent pipeline to develop strong leaders for our company’s future. To that end, we benefit from an experienced, value-driven management team and dedicated workforce. 
We strive to achieve alignment at every layer and throughout all functional areas of our business and are focused on ensuring the right systems are in place to facilitate all team members working toward the same shared goals. Critical to this is the One Wabash mindset that our business is constructed of three interlinked segments that benefit from one another and are stronger as a result of being part of Wabash National.
▪Extensive Distribution Network – We utilize a network of 23 independent dealers with approximately 80 locations throughout North America to distribute our van trailers, and our Transcraft distribution network consists of 65 independent dealers with approximately 93 locations throughout North America. Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 54 independent dealers with 56 locations throughout North America. Additionally, our truck body dealer network consists of more than 1,000 commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets.
Regulation
Truck trailer length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain safety and environmental sustainability features incorporated in the design and use of truck and tank trailers, as well as truck bodies. These regulations include: requirements to install Electronic Logging Devices, the use of aerodynamic devices and fuel saving technologies, as well as operator restrictions as to hours of service and minimum driver safety standards (see “Industry Trends” included within Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details on these regulations). In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws enforced by federal, state and local agencies (see “Environmental Matters”).
Products
Since our inception, we have worked to expand our product offerings from a single truck trailer dry van product to a broad range of engineered solutions for the transportation, logistics, and distribution industries to help our customers move everything from first to final mile. We manage a diverse product portfolio, maintain long-standing customer relationships, and focuses on innovative and breakthrough technologies within three operating segments.

Marketing and Distribution
We market and distribute our products through the following channels:
▪Factory direct accounts; and
▪Independent dealerships.
Factory direct accounts are generally large fleets that are high volume purchasers. Historically, we have focused on the factory direct market in which customers are highly knowledgeable of the life-cycle costs of equipment and, therefore, are best equipped to appreciate the innovative design and value-added features of our products, as well as the value proposition for lower total cost of ownership over the life-cycle of our products.
We also sell our van, platform, and tank trailers through a network of independent dealers. Additionally, our truck body products are sold through commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets. The dealers may also perform service and warranty work for our customers.
Raw Materials
We utilize a variety of raw materials and components including, but not limited to, specialty steel coil, stainless steel, plastic, aluminum, lumber, tires, landing gear, axles and suspensions, which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. Raw material costs as a percentage of net sales for 2020 were relatively consistent with 2019. However, significant price fluctuations or shortages in raw materials or finished components have had, and could have in the future, adverse effects on our results of operations. In 2021 and for the foreseeable future, we expect that the raw materials used in the greatest quantity will be steel, aluminum, plastic, and wood. We will endeavor to pass along raw material and component cost increases. Price increases used to offset inflation or disruption of supply in core materials have generally been successful, although sometimes are delayed. Increases in prices for these purposes represent a risk in execution. In an effort to minimize the effect of price fluctuations, we only hedge certain commodities that have the potential to significantly impact our results of operations.
Backlog
Orders that have been confirmed by customers in writing, have defined delivery timeframes and can be produced during the next 18 months are included in our backlog. Orders that comprise our backlog may be subject to changes in quantities, delivery, specifications, terms or cancellation. Our backlog of orders at December 31, 2020 was approximately $1,482 million, which is an increase of 31% from the backlog as of December 31, 2019 of $1,127 million. We believe our backlog of orders is strong as of December 31, 2020, especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our industry, operations, and demand for our products. We expect to complete the majority of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2020 within the next 12 months.
Patents and Intellectual Property
We hold or have applied for 148 patents in the U.S. on various components and techniques utilized in our manufacture of transportation equipment and engineered products. In addition, we hold or have applied for 187 patents or registered designs in foreign countries.
Our patents include intellectual property related to the manufacture of trailers, containers, and aerodynamic-related products using our proprietary DuraPlate® products, truck body, trailer, and aerodynamic-related products utilizing other lightweight panel products and composite materials, our containment and isolation systems, tanks, and other engineered products—all of which we believe offer us a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete.
Our DuraPlate® patent portfolio includes several patents and pending patent applications, which cover not only utilization of our DuraPlate® products in the manufacture of trailers, but also cover a number of aerodynamic-related products aimed at increasing the fuel efficiency of trailers. U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our DuraPlate® patent portfolio have expiration dates extending until 2036. Certain U.S. patents relating to the combined use of DuraPlate® panels and logistics systems within the sidewalls of our dry van trailers will not expire until 2027 or after; several other issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications relating to the use of DuraPlate® panels, or other composite materials, within aerodynamic-related 
products will not begin to expire until after 2030. Additionally, we also believe that our proprietary DuraPlate® and DuraPlate® Cell Core production processes, which have been developed and refined since 1995, offer us a significant competitive advantage in the industry – above and beyond the benefits provided by any patent protection concerning the use and/or design of our DuraPlate® products. We believe the proprietary knowledge of these processes and the significant intellectual and capital hurdles in creating similar production processes provide us with an advantage over others in the industry who utilize composite sandwich panel technology. 
Our intellectual property portfolio further includes a number of patent applications related to the manufacture of truck bodies and trailers using our high-performance MSC Technology™ polymer composite component parts. These patents and patent applications cover the polymer composite component structure and method of manufacturing the same. We believe the intellectual property related to this use of polymer composite technology in our industry, including proprietary knowledge of the processes involved in manufacturing these components and the resulting products, will offer us a significant market advantage to continue to create proprietary products exploiting this technology. These patent applications will not begin to expire until 2036. Additionally, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents related to the rear impact guard (“RIG”). The RIG patents include RIG designs which surpass the current and proposed federal regulatory RIG standards for the U.S. and Canada and will not begin to expire until 2035.
In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering many of our engineered products, including our containment and isolation systems, as well as many trailer industry components. These products have become highly desirable and are recognized for their innovation in the markets we serve. The engineered products patents and patent applications relate to our industry leading isolation systems, sold under the Extract Technologies® brand name. While these patents will begin to expire in late 2021 and 2022, we hold additional patents and/or patent applications relating to containment assemblies with recirculatory airflow which will expire in 2027 and to modular cell therapy isolators which expire in 2038. The patents relating to our proprietary trailer-industry componentry include, for example, those covering the Trust Lock Plus® door locking mechanism, the Max Clearance® Overhead Door System, which provides additional overhead clearance when an overhead-style rear door is in the opened position that would be comparable to that of swing-door models, the use of bonded or riveted intermediate logistics strips, the bonded D-ring hold-down device, bonded skylights, and the DuraPlate® arched roof. The patents covering these products will not expire before 2029. We believe all of these proprietary products offer us a competitive market advantage in the industries in which we compete.
We also hold or have applied for 43 trademarks in the U.S. as well as 63 trademarks in foreign countries. These trademarks include the Wabash®, Wabash National®, Transcraft®, Benson®, Extract Technology®, Brenner®, and Supreme® brand names as well as trademarks associated with our proprietary products such as DuraPlate®, Transcraft Eagle®, Arctic Lite®, Kold King®, Iner-City®, Isopharm®, and Steripharm®. Additionally, we utilize several tradenames that are each well-recognized in their industries, including Walker Transport, Walker Stainless Equipment, Walker Engineered Products, and Bulk Tank International. Our trademarks associated with additional proprietary products include MSC Technology™, MaxClearance® Overhead Door System, Trust Lock Plus® EZ-7®, DuraPlate Aeroskirt®, Aeroskirt CX®, DuraPlate HD®, SolarGuard®, Lock-Rite®, and EZ-Adjust®. We believe these trademarks are important for the identification of our products and the associated customer goodwill; however, our business is not materially dependent on such trademarks.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and occupational safety and health. Our operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of enforcement actions or proceedings for non-compliance with such laws or for remediation of company-related releases of substances into the environment. Resolution of such matters with regulators can result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, the payment of penalties (see “Legal Proceedings” in Part I Item 3 for more details).
We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our facilities have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. However, we currently do not anticipate that the future costs of environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
