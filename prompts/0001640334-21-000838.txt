Products  
 
Currently, the Company, through Common Design, is involved in the apparel trading business. We source products from suppliers and manufacturers in China and sell such products to customers overseas through buyers and agents in Hong Kong.
 
In the future, the Company also plans to develop and sell its own line of products and to have such products manufactured in China. As of the date of this Form 10K, the Company has not yet begun the development of its own line of products. The Company expects to engage third-party designers to design the Company's line of products. Once designed, the Company then plans to subcontract the production of its own line of products to manufacturers in China from which the Company is sourcing the products which it currently sells.  
 
The Company focuses on the supply and distribution of a wide range of adult and children apparel, including costumes, dancewear, swimwear, and casual wear.
 
Costumes.
 The Company plans to distribute a selection of adult and children costumes for every occasion, from Halloween to parties and holiday celebrations. 
 
Dancewear.
 The Company plans to source a variety of basic and performance dancewear for ballet, contemporary dance, jazz, as well as holiday and character theme dance apparel. 
Swimwear.
 The Company plans to have a collection of swimwear includes women’s one-piece bathing suits, bikinis, cover-ups, as well as men’s board shorts, swim trunks, and assorted children’s swimwear. 
Casual Wear.
 The Company plans to design and market its own line of men’s T-shirts and polo shirts and to market the products through online B2C platforms and offline in China.
Product Supply
 
The Company currently sources its products from manufacturers and suppliers based in Hong Kong and China. With extensive experience in the industry, the Company has good relationships with a number of manufacturers to ensure a secure supply of its current products. The Company’s physical proximity to suppliers not only builds strong rapport but will also likely lead to greater quality control and reliability and efficiency in manufacturing and delivery. Building and fostering supplier relationships will be integral to the Company’s success and competitive advantage. The Company plans to use its current relationships with manufactures for the manufacturing of its own product line.
Market Overview
 
Apparel Industry
 
The apparel business is one of the world’s fastest growing industries. Much of this growth can be attributed to the developing markets, notably those of middle-class Asian consumers with an increased interest in clothing as an extension and expression of their new lifestyle. The same consumers are also traveling and shopping abroad with spending outside of their home countries. Particularly, in the luxury goods market, a large percent of all sales is expected to be made by Chinese consumers1.
 
Costume Industry
 
According to a National Retail Federation’s annual survey, total spending for Halloween in the United States was expected to reach $8.4 billion in 2016, with each buyer spending an average of roughly US$83. Spending on Halloween costumes was expected to reach $3.1 billion with 67 percent of Halloween shoppers planning on purchasing a costume. The number of people dressing in costumes represents a 7.3 percent increase over an average of the past 12 years.

Dancewear Industry
 
Based on the 2017 market research conducted by QR Research, the global dancewear market was valued at $429 million in 2016 and is anticipated to reach $555 million by the end of 2022, growing at a rate of 4.38 percent between 2016 and 2022.
Swimwear Industry
 
The management of the Company believes that the global swimwear market will continue to grow and is projected to reach 2.2 billion units valued at $22.7 billion by 2022. Product innovations remain a key driver for developed countries where the market is highly saturated. Western countries with their large number of swimming pools and water parks saw an increase in swimming as a leisure and recreational activity. 
 
Emerging countries represent the highest growth markets with Brazil and the United States leading as the largest market worldwide and the Asia-Pacific region as the fastest growing market with an expected annual rate of over 10 percent through 2022. In 2016, the swimwear market was dominated by women’s swimwear at 67.88 percent market share, followed by men’s swimwear at 17.72 percent and children’s swimwear at 14.40 percent.
 
Competition
 
The apparel market is highly competitive and fragmented with no single company dominating the industry. The industry is highly cyclical and dependent upon various factors including the overall level of discretionary consumer spending and changes taking place in the economic environment. The Company is competing on a domestic and international front amongst other exporters, wholesalers, retailers, and manufacturers. There are various competitive factors at play in the apparel market, including price, design, quality, brand image, marketing, customer service, and consumer preference.
 
The apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing trends and shifting consumer demands. Stakes are high in staying aware and remaining sensitive to changes in the industry. Part of a company’s success will be dependent upon its ability to identify and capitalize on these emerging trends in the marketplace. More importantly, a company will need to focus on its internal process and supply chain to maintain a competitive edge through the leveraging of its network of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistic providers. Maintaining and developing such relationships can make a substantial difference in a company’s ability to develop, source, and market products at competitive prices.
 
Market Strategy
 
The Company plans to distribute products through various wholesale distribution channels, with sales going through local buyers in Hong Kong to wholesalers in North America, Europe, and Australia. The Company expects to maintain a direct line of contact with its suppliers in China, managing the sourcing and subcontracting of products in-house, while delivering products to local buyers and sales agents for distribution to overseas markets. Its efforts are anticipated to be placed on building a strong customer base with a focus on quality, design, and service to generate repeat sales while continuously attracting new buyers. 
 
The Company has a flexible structure to accommodate to the needs of specific clients. The Company believes in establishing a long-term relationship with each of its clients through personalized service tactics, such as the employment of flexible minimum order quantity. While tailored made offerings are becoming increasingly popular at the retail level, the Company believes the embracing of such tactics can bring about tremendous benefit at the distributor level, with consumers feeling valued and distinct. 
 
The Company expects to market products through referrals, sales agents, print advertisements, showrooms, and online platforms specific to each product group. Local buyers make up an important channel for the Company in bringing business outside of domestic grounds and breaking the barrier to entry into larger and more substantiating international markets. Optimizing on the management's network of contacts and maintaining a solid network of contacts is critical to the success of the Company.

Pricing Strategy 
 
The Company aims to produce a variety of quality products to its customers at competitive prices. In doing so, resources are expected to be allocated to product development to create more value-added goods that can be delivered to clients in the timeliest manner. The pricing objective of the Company is not to become the lowest cost provider in the industry, but to achieve competitive pricing without the compromise of product quality. The Company targets a profit margin of a minimum of 10 to 15 percent for its range of apparels, with more favourable pricing offered to long-term and large volume consumers. 
 
The Company’s strategy to maintain cost competitiveness is primarily done through the effective coordination of logistic functions and utilization of cost-efficient distribution channels. Enhancing supply chain management is also key to reducing inventory volume and logistics expenses. The Company aims to maintain strong relationships and rapport with each member of the supply chain to gain a better foothold in negotiation and facilitation of services. Management’s expertise and network in the industry is planned to be utilized in every effective way to reduce costs and achieve a greater profit margin. However, given the Company's limited operating history, it does not have a significant history of doing business with such network of contacts. 
 
Sales Strategy
 
A majority of the Company’s business is expected to be conducted through direct sales and a dedicated sales force to help the Company tap into unexplored markets and to relay the latest trends in the apparel industry. In order to remain reactive to those shifting currents and reduce inventory cost, the Company plans to employ just-in-time manufacturing and fulfill orders as they are requested. Client orders will likely be completed on a per-order basis after a minimum order quantity has been achieved, in which a production schedule will be set out to ensure an efficient process will be followed from the beginning of production to the distribution of the finished goods. 
Promotion Strategy 
 
The Company plans to market its products and services through online and word-of-mouth advertising. The Company aims to be active on a number of B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms appropriate to each of its anticipated product lines to widen its reach and enhance the ‘Company’s exposure in the marketplace.
