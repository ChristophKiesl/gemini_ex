Overview 
Sumo Logic empowers the people who power modern, digital businesses. Our mission is to be the leading software-as-a-service analytics platform for reliable and secure cloud-native applications. With our platform, we help our customers ensure application reliability, secure and protect against modern security threats, and gain insights into their cloud infrastructure. Our multi-tenant, cloud-native platform – which we refer to as our Continuous Intelligence Platform – provides powerful, real-time, machine data analytics and insights across observability and security solutions.
Nearly every enterprise across every industry is embracing digital transformation. As enterprises seek to transform by building digital services and cloud applications, they often embark upon multiple technology changes. Successful digital businesses adopt modern software development practices to accelerate innovation, use cloud infrastructure for flexibility, and adopt modern architectures like microservices in order to improve reliability and scale. While these changes can deliver agility, speed, and other benefits, they also can create complexity in the form of rapid rate of change, proliferation of technology automation, expanded use of cloud and open source technologies, exponential growth in data, and increased possible points of attack. Challenges managing these complexities can negatively affect application reliability, security, performance, and ultimately customer experience. Thus, enterprises are dependent on machine data analytics for the insights they need to build, manage, and secure their critical cloud applications. By delivering an analytics platform for observability and security for cloud applications, we enable our customers to transform into differentiated, digital businesses and improve digital experiences for their users. Our vision is to make the world’s digital experiences reliable and secure.
Our Platform
Our Continuous Intelligence Platform is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, secure service that our customers leverage to enable reliability and security of their cloud applications and cloud workloads. We built our platform as a modern, cloud-native, microservices application that implements security-first principles. Our platform was originally built to address complex, unstructured log data at massive scale, optimizing data ingestion and processing while providing powerful analytics. Over time, we extended our platform to other types of machine data for full stack observability and security analytics.
Modern Architecture. Our platform runs on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) using intelligent resource management, auto scaling, and partitioning logic to manage our compute and storage footprint so that we can deliver resiliency and optimal performance while maintaining efficiency. Our platform runs across multiple regions and within each region across multiple AWS data centers, and our microservices are distributed to avoid single points of failure.
Security-first Principles. Our platform was designed from the beginning to protect our customers’ data through encryption, audits, processes, and adherence to compliance regulations. Our platform encrypts data in transit and at rest, uses customer specific encryption keys, encrypts those keys separately, and applies best practices for processes surrounding access to our platform. Our platform is PCI DSS 3.2.1 Service Provider Level 1 certified, SOC 2 Type 2 attested, HIPAA compliance attested, ISO 27001 certified, and has FedRAMP Moderate authorization. Furthermore, our platform is deployed in AWS regions around the world, allowing customers to comply with data sovereignty rules.
Machine Data Analytics. We ingest and analyze machine data generated by applications, infrastructure, and microservices, enabling our customers to derive actionable insights. Our platform is designed to collect and centralize data from a multitude of data sources by integrating seamlessly with other solutions. Our platform leverages our core capabilities to enable reliability and security for cloud applications, including:
Data Collection and Management. We support a wide variety of data collection protocols and can collect data from any digital environment, including on-premise and cloud. Our platform supports structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data types across a variety of data formats. Our platform also collects and analyzes unknown and non-premeditated data sets, including custom application logs, metrics, traces, events, and metadata to understand the internal state, security, and business performance of our customers’ digital services and applications. We collect data through prepackaged collectors, APIs, and other proprietary or open source integrations. Our platform supports ingest time parsing into a schema, as well as on-demand schema inference, in order to enable analytics on unstructured data. We support ingest time data transformation and enrichment to quickly convert between data formats to optimize for ease of analysis, performance, and cost. In addition, our platform offers data tiering and data budgeting capabilities to provide our customers with an effective and cost-efficient way to manage and grow their data volume and usage. Policies can be set that govern the granularity of data management and 
enable various levels of analytics. Our customers can configure retention policies per data set from days to years to satisfy internal requirements, external regulatory rules, or specific cost and data value requirements.
Analytics. The core power of our Continuous Intelligence Platform is our proprietary, state-of-the-art analytics system that can analyze data, at petabyte scale, in real-time.
•Search. Our platform enables high-speed search using keywords, full phrases, patterns, Boolean logic, and metadata across one or multiple data sets. Our search engine supports powerful data manipulation operators and constructs in order to help customers rapidly identify and address outages, performance issues, security threats, trends and behaviors. We are also able to infer and extract schema on demand without requiring ingest time parsing.
•Machine learning. We have a variety of proprietary algorithms and machine learning technologies that enhance our analytics system, including LogReduce/LogCompare, LogExplain, TimeCompare, Outlier, and Predict.
•Correlation rules. Our Cloud Security Incident and Event Monitoring, or SIEM, technology offers a scalable real-time correlation engine that our customers use to detect threats across multiple sources of data. We provide out-of-the-box correlation rules built around industry standards and best practices.
•Threat intelligence. We provide an out-of-the-box threat intelligence data set containing indicators of compromise, which enables customers to analyze their data to assess matches against those indicators and react accordingly.
•Global intelligence service. Our multi-tenant platform enables us to analyze data, determine expected behaviors, and create anonymized behavior benchmarks. These benchmarks can be used by our customers to detect and explain unexpected events, threats, and behaviors outside of expected boundaries for our customers’ infrastructure. Our global intelligence service enables our customers to improve their security posture, detect vulnerabilities, optimize provisioning, resolve inefficiencies, and remove risk from their applications and infrastructure.
Visualization and Notifications. Our platform offers powerful data visualization, filtering, and notification/alerting capabilities to empower users with insights and intelligence extracted from their machine data. Our dashboards are used to visualize data in real-time in order to both monitor and troubleshoot conditions affecting reliability and security of our customers’ applications. Our alerts are used to notify users when a specific known or unknown condition is met or detected. Customers can set up alerts themselves or use many out-of-the-box alerts packaged with our solutions. Our alerts can both notify users directly or can trigger workflows, APIs, or orchestration/automation within our own or third party systems. We support a variety of inbound data collection integrations for cloud and traditional systems as well as outbound integrations used to send data and notifications to third party systems. Our integrations also support automated and orchestrated response through our Cloud Security Orchestration, Automated, and Response, or SOAR, technology for many third party technologies.
Configuration. Our platform provides powerful capabilities for configuration and security controls. We offer single sign-on, multi factor authentication, and a robust, enterprise-level role-based access control system, or RBAC.

Our industry requires constant change and innovation, and we plan to continue to evolve our platform technology to empower our customers to monitor and troubleshoot application and infrastructure performance in real time, act on threats instantly, and make smarter business decisions. However, we could face significant risks to our business, financial condition, and results of operations as a result of competition.1
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property protection for our technology, inventions, improvements, proprietary rights, and other assets. We seek to accomplish that objective by establishing intellectual property rights in and protecting those assets through a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures. As of January 31, 2022, we owned 35 issued U.S. patents, eight issued non-U.S. patents, 15 U.S. patent applications, no pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and seven non-U.S. patent applications. Our issued U.S. patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending applications, would be scheduled to expire at dates ranging between June 2031 and September 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, as of January 31, 
1 See the section titled “Risk Factors—We face intense competition and could face pricing pressure from, and lose market share to, our competitors, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations” for additional information.

2022, we owned 18 registered trademarks in the United States, two pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 33 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions and 16 pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also license software from third parties for integration into our platform, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
Additionally, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors, and customers, and generally limiting access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our offerings or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and time consuming. Third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. The laws, procedures, and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property against us, our customers, or our channel partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims.2
Employees and Human Capital
We believe having a community of passionate, talented individuals committed to creating significant customer impact and value is critical to our long-term success. As of January 31, 2022, we had a total of 943 employees located in 16 countries. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our objective is to create the organizational conditions and culture for talented individuals to thrive. We focus on identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and engaging our new and existing employees and consultants. Our compensation program is designed to advance our technological innovation, business success, and stockholder value by motivating individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our strategic objectives. We offer competitive pay and benefits, equity grants, including paid family leave, flexible work schedules, and a comprehensive health and wellness program. In addition to medical, dental. and vision plans that also extend to dependents and family, we provide flexible spending accounts, tax-free commuter and parking expenses, 401(k) plans, and access to multiple other platforms. In addition to traditional employee benefits, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employee base. We encourage continuous learning and professional development, and have invested in diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives, including employee resource groups.
We’ve also invested in various environmental, social and governance, or ESG, initiatives. We conducted a full assessment of our carbon, water, and waste footprint at our headquarters in Redwood City, California, assess environmental criteria when evaluating new offices, and consider environmental management strategies based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks. Furthermore, as a cloud-native company, we are not reliant on large data centers and thus we have a significantly reduced environmental footprint, including low Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Additionally, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employee base. We encourage continuous learning and professional development and have implemented company-wide diversity and inclusion training program and formed several employee resource groups. We also donated time and resources to local organizations supporting COVID-19 relief, women’s education, environmental management, food justice, and more. We have also formalized ESG oversight with our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and developed new policies including a supplier code of conduct and human rights statement.
