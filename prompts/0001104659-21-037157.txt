Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are an infant and juvenile products company doing business under the name SUMR Brands. We are a recognized authority in the juvenile product industry, providing parents and caregivers a full range of innovative, high-quality, and high-value products to care for babies and toddlers. We seek to improve the quality of life of parents, caregivers, and babies through our product offerings, while at the same time maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
 
We operate in one principal industry segment across geographically diverse marketplaces, selling our products globally to large, national retailers as well as independent retailers, on our partner’s websites, and our own direct to consumer website. In North America, our customers include Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, Target, Buy Buy Baby, Home Depot, and Lowe’s. Our largest European-based customers are Smyths Toys and Amazon. We also sell through international distributors, representatives, and to select international retail customers in geographic locations where we do not have a direct sales presence. Our company was originally founded in 1985 and has publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market since 2007 under the symbol “SUMR”.
 
Strategic Priorities
 
Our goal is to become a globally recognized leader in the juvenile product industry by creating products that families everywhere need, want, love and depend on. To support our roadmap for sustainable growth in 2021 and beyond, we will continue to seek to develop and launch new products based on consumer demand, while also strengthening our core product offerings. Additionally, we will continue to expand our reach through a portfolio of brands, strategically positioned to appeal to multiple consumer demographics, and further develop our key customer relationships. In addition to organic growth, we will consider acquisitions of products or businesses, consistent with our roadmap. We believe the following key strategic priorities position us to capitalize on market trends and fuel our future growth:

• | Growth through product. We continuously seek to create differentiated products that appeal to consumers who increasingly demand high-quality, long-lasting products that make family life easier, safer, and more fun. We pride ourselves as leaders of innovation within the juvenile products industry. We strive to deliver innovation in various ways based upon product category, including design innovation in potties and gates, new convenience features in bath and strollers, and an expanded range of safe-sleep solutions within our SwaddleMe® branded product line. In addition to being leaders of innovation in the juvenile products industry, in 2021, we are considering plans to expand into the pet industry with a new brand featuring products for pets that are congruent with our juvenile assortment. We believe that with our ability to analyze a market to find opportunistic growth, combined with our core development capabilities, as well as our strong manufacturing partnerships, the pet industry is an opportunity for incremental growth in addition to the juvenile products industry.

• | Growth through brand. By maintaining a strategic approach to our consumer brands, we believe we are positioned to expand our appeal to a wide variety of consumer demographics while providing retailer differentiation. We continue to take a digital-first approach to marketing communications and brand development. In addition, we expect to continue to focus on online merchandising to drive conversion rates both in-store and online, as a majority of consumers research products online before buying either at retail or through e-commerce.

• | Growth through distribution. We have strong partnerships with our suppliers in the U.S., Mexico, and Asia. We believe that our ability to develop products that are preferred by consumers and cost-efficient gives us a competitive advantage in meeting our customer demands. We have long-standing relationships with our brick and mortar and e-commerce retail customers in the U.S., and will continue to focus on strengthening them to increase our presence in stores and online.

• | Continuous infrastructure improvement. A large percentage of our 2020 initiatives were focused on operational cost reductions, product sourcing and tariff mitigation, and streamlining improvements. Active programs include ongoing SKU reductions and rationalization, warehouse labor reductions, leasehold rationalization and the subletting of excess space where applicable. Additionally, we plan on increasing our direct import business and relocating product manufacturing from Asia to reduce tariffs and other costs.

Products
 
We currently market our products in several product categories including gates, potty, bath, entertainers, baby monitors, specialty blankets, strollers, car seats and travel systems. We are a North American market leader in the gate, bath, and the potty categories as well as a North American market leader in the convenience stroller segment. We market our core products, under our Summer™ and SwaddleMe® brand names.
 
Within gates, we offer a product range of more than 30 products. Our line of gates offers versatility that covers use in home, ease of installation, and aesthetically pleasing designs. We continue to receive positive feedback from retailers as we expand our portfolio with consumer preferred features and styling.
 
We first entered the infant bathing category in 2002, and we have continued to create useful and safe solutions for bathing. Our innovative bath product, My Bath Seat™ continues to be extremely popular with consumers. We have an established roadmap for developing products in the four phases of bathing (sponges, bathers, bath tubs, and bath seats) to address consumer needs as baby grows, and to create loyalty to our brands.
 
Our My Size™ Potty and the My Size™ Potty Train & Transition have been well-received by retailers and consumers alike. In late 2020 and early 2021, we launched an expanded range of potty training products. We are a market share leader in potties, with additional offerings that support different consumer needs and various price points in regards to potty training.
 
We are a North American market leader in the convenience segment of strollers. Our 3Dlite® Convenience Stroller continues to be a favorite among parents. We have continued to expand our range of convenience stroller platforms to appeal to the experienced parent. In addition, in 2020, we launched the Myria modular travel system and the Affirm 335 infant car seat that attract first time expectant parents to our products.
 
Our monitors were first introduced in 2001 and are distinguished by ease of use, innovative features, and their high quality. Currently, we offer audio and video monitors under the Summer™ brand. Our monitors feature high quality components, intended to fulfill the desire for consumers to connect with baby at any time or place.
 
Our specialty blankets include SwaddleMe® specialty blankets as well as our expanded line of Slumber Buddy soothers. Acquired in 2008, SwaddleMe® continues to be a trusted brand synonymous with infant safe sleep. A new brand refresh and an expanded range of products were launched in 2020, and we expect to continue to add new stages of sleep products to our available assortment.
 
Product Development and Design
 
A thorough understanding of our consumer, the competition, and our customer retail partners drives our product development. Developing and marketing innovative solutions are a critical element of our strategy. We strive to produce proprietary products that offer distinctive benefits, are visually appealing, and provide safe, thoughtful solutions.
 
We conduct market analyses in our geographic regions of priority, evaluate identified opportunities, and design products accordingly. The majority of our products are currently designed at our Rhode Island headquarters. When appropriate, we also partner with manufacturers in Asia on product development. In addition to new product development, we continuously look for ways to improve upon existing products based on consumer insights with a strong focus on the end-user experience.

Suppliers and Manufacturing
 
We source our products globally from a variety of suppliers and manufacturers, including from China, Vietnam, the United States and Mexico. We are not dependent on any one supplier as we use many different manufacturers and presently own the tooling and molds used for our products. Our Hong Kong subsidiary provides us with an Asian sourcing presence and the ability to oversee quality, electronic engineering and other issues that may arise during production. Generally, we buy finished goods from manufacturers, and thus do not directly procure raw materials for product manufacturing. Historically, we have not experienced any significant disruption of supply as a result of raw material shortages or other manufacturing factors, but there is the possibility that shortages could occur in the future based on a variety of factors beyond our control.
 
Asian-made goods are shipped on the water to our warehouses, which typically takes up to four weeks. We also utilize a direct import program, to reduce costs and shipping time to certain customers. We maintain inventory in warehouses located in the United States and Canada as well as a third-party logistics warehouse in China. Most of our customers pick up their goods at our warehouses. We also deliver shipments direct to customers for sales from our own website and our consumer replacements program as well as for other smaller retail partners that request such arrangements.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our products are largely marketed and sold through our own direct sales force. We have also established a strong network of independent manufacturers’ representatives and distributors to provide sales and customer service support for retail customers in North America and internationally. We seek to expand our direct-to-consumer sales, which we believe will also increase overall brand awareness. Sales are recognized upon transfer of title to our customers and are made utilizing standard credit terms of approximately 60 days. We generally accept returns only for defective merchandise.
 
Marketing, promotion and consumer engagement are key elements in the juvenile industry. Historically, a significant percentage of our promotional spending has been structured in coordination with large retail partners. We continue to focus our marketing efforts on growing brand awareness among our target consumer demographic, optimizing marketing investments, and executing an integrated marketing strategy. We believe an important component of our future growth is based on speaking to the right customer, with the right content, in the right channel, at the right time. We have implemented online marketing, social media, and digital analytics tools, which allow us to better measure the performance of our marketing activities, learn from our consumers, and receive valuable insights into industry and competitor activities.
 
Customer service is a critical component of our marketing strategy. We maintain a U.S.-based internal customer service department that responds to customer inquiries, investigates and resolves issues, and is available to assist customers and consumers during business hours.
 
Competition
 
The juvenile product industry has many participants, none of which has dominant market share, though certain companies may have disproportionate strength in specific product categories. We compete with a number of different companies in a variety of categories, although there is no single company that competes with us across all of our product categories. Our largest direct competitors are Tomy Company, Ltd., Dorel Industries, Inc., Regalo Baby®, Munchkin®, GB® (Goodbaby International Holdings, Ltd.), Graco® (a subsidiary of Newell Rubbermaid), Chicco®, Fisher-Price® (a subsidiary of Mattel, Inc.), Aden & Anais®, and Motorola® (a licensed brand of Binatone Communications Group).
 
The primary method of competition in the industry consists of brand positioning, product innovation, quality, price, and timely distribution. Our competitive strengths include our ability to develop innovative new products, speed to market, our relationships with major retailers, and the quality and pricing of our products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. Our current U.S. patents include various design features related to safety gates, bouncers, bathers, and monitors with several other patents under review by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The issued U.S. patents expire at various times depending on the date of issuance during the next 18 years. In certain circumstances, we will partner with third parties to develop proprietary products, and, where appropriate, we have license agreements related to the use of third-party innovation in our products. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
Customers
 
Sales to the Company’s top seven customers together comprised approximately 87% of our sales in fiscal 2020 and 81% of our sales in fiscal 2019. Of these customers, three generated more than 10% of sales for fiscal 2020: Amazon.com (33%), Walmart (28%), and Target (17%). In fiscal 2019, three customers generated more than 10% of sales: Amazon.com (26%), Walmart (25%), and Target (17%).
 
We have no long-term contracts with these customers, and as a result, our success depends heavily on our customers’ willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products.

Seasonality
 
We do experience some variations in seasonal demand for our products in our second and third quarters of each year. However, we expect to generate higher than average volumes for the initial shipment of new products which typically includes enough inventory to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer’s distribution center. The timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year and whether there are any mid-year product introductions.
Regulatory Matters
 
Each of our products is designed to comply with all applicable mandatory and voluntary safety standards. In the United States, these safety standards are promulgated by federal, state and independent agencies such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, ASTM, the Federal Communications Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and various states Attorney Generals and state regulatory agencies. All of our products are independently tested by third party laboratories accepted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to verify compliance to applicable safety standards. A similar approach is used to design and test products sold internationally.
Insurance
 
We carry product liability insurance that provides us with $15,000 coverage with a minimal deductible. We consult with our insurers to ascertain appropriate liability coverage for our product mix. We believe our current coverage is adequate for our existing business and will continue to evaluate our coverage in the future in line with our expanding sales and product breadth.
Employees
 
We believe that the development, attraction and retention of employees is an important factor to our Company’s success. We offer our employees a wide range of benefits, and to support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. As of January 2, 2021, we had 119 employees, 115 of whom were full time employees and 55 of whom worked in our Rhode Island headquarters.
