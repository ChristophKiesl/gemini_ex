Industry Overview
 
Esports is the competitive playing of video games by amateur and professional teams for cash prizes. Esports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. As of July 7, 2021, the three largest selling esports games are Dota 2®, League of Legends® (both multiplayer online battle arena games) and Counter Strike: Global Offensive® (a first-person shooter game). Other popular games include SMITE®, StarCraft II®, Call of Duty®¸ Heroes of the Storm®, Hearthstone® and Fortnite®. Most major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events are broadcast live via streaming services including twitch.tv, azubu.tv, ustream.tv and youtube.com. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions on the Sony PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox® and WII Nintendo® systems.
 
Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a global surge in popularity over the last few years with the rapid growth of online streaming. The advent of online streaming technology has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in person in stadiums, and by online viewers, which regularly exceed 1,000,000 viewers for major tournaments. According to Business Insider, over 100 million viewers saw the 2019 League of Legends® World Championships in person and online. CNBC reported in April 2019 that League of Legends® World Championships attract more viewers than the Super Bowl. Much like how there is a worldwide gaming market for the sports industry, there has now developed a worldwide gaming market for the esports industry. The impact has been so significant that many video game developers are now building features into their games designed to facilitate competition.

According to Newzoo, a global leader in esports, games and mobile intelligence, the total global esports audience was 500 million in 2019, with an anticipated 27.5 million American gamers, and such global audience is expected to reach 646 million by 2023. In addition, according to Newzoo, esports produced $950 million in 2019 revenue and was projected to reach $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2023. Esports enthusiasts, which are people who watch professional esports content at least once a month, made up 201.2 million of the 2018 total, up from 143.2 million in 2017. With a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) (2017-2022) of +15.7%, this number is expected to reach almost 297 million in 2022. The global average revenue per esports enthusiast, which includes not only gaming revenue, but also sponsorships advertising and all other esports related revenues, is projected to be $5.45 in 2019, up +8.9% from $5.00 in 2018. The number of occasional esports viewers, (people who watch professional esports content less than once a month), is expected to reach 252.6 million in 2019, up from 221.6 million in 2018, and is projected to grow with a CAGR of +12.6% to surpass 347 million in 2022. The number of people who are aware of esports worldwide was expected to reach 1.8 billion in 2019, up from 1.6 billion in 2018. According to Newtech Mag, China and the U.S. have the largest populations of esports fans, with Brazil ranking first in Latin America, which is the fastest growing gaming market, and third globally, with 20 million fans. The increasing prominence of esports as a mainstream entertainment industry is driving the growth in awareness in most regions. Audience and awareness growth in the emerging regions of Latin America, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, and Rest of Asia is largely driven by improving IT infrastructure and urbanization. We believe the rise of new franchises, such as Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds® or PubG®, is an important global growth factor as the influx of millennials should continue to drive the growth of the esports industry’s audience and in turn, the esports gaming industry.
 
In 2019, globally there were 885 major esports events that generated an estimated $56.3 million in ticket revenues. The total prize money of all esports events held in 2019 reached $167.4 million, a slight increase from $150.8 million in 2018. The League of Legends® World Championship was 2019’s biggest tournament by live viewership hours on Twitch and YouTube, with 105.5 million hours. It also produced $1.9 million in ticket revenues. The Overwatch® League was the most-watched league by live viewership hours on Twitch and YouTube, generating 104.1 million hours. A report by Forbes estimates that the top 12 esports teams had 2019 revenues of between $8 million and $29 million and were valued at between $120 million and $400 million.
 
Business Overview
 
We are a global esports organization, that is capitalizing on the growth in esports through three business units, Simplicity One Brasil Ltda (“Simplicity One”), Simplicity Esports, LLC (“Simplicity Esports LLC”) and PLAYlive Nation, Inc. (“PLAYlive”). We believe that we are the only Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reporting, completely integrated-esports company that owns a League of Legends franchise. Additionally, we have the largest network of corporate and franchisee owned esports gaming centers in North America.
Our Esports Teams
 
We own and manage multiple professional esports teams domestically and internationally. Revenue is generated from prize winnings, corporate sponsorships, advertising, league subsidy payments and potential league revenue sharing payments from the publishers of video games.
Domestic Esports Teams – Simplicity Esports LLC
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Simplicity Esports LLC, we own and manage multiple professional esports teams competing in games such as Heroes of the Storm. We are committed to growing and enhancing the esports industry, fostering the development of amateurs to compete professionally and signing established professional gamers to support their paths to greater success.
International Esports Team - Simplicity One


Since January 2020, through our 76% owned subsidiary Simplicity One, we manage Flamengo eSports, one of the leading Brazilian League of Legends® teams competing in the top tier league CBLoL. CBLoL was the most talked about esports league in the world, on Twitter for the first half of 2021, with Call of Duty League and Overwatch League ranking 2nd and 3rd respectively. Flamengo eSports was established in 2017 as the Esports division of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, a successful Brazilian sports organization, with over 30 million followers across social media accounts, known for its world-famous soccer team. Flamengo eSports’ League of Legends® team won the CBLoL Championship in September 2019, which qualified the team to compete at the 2019 League of Legends® World Championship in Europe as one of 24 teams from 13 different regions around the world. Flamengo Esports @flaesports was ranked as the 6th most tweeted about esports organization in the world, ahead of Team Liquid and Cloud 9 ranking 7th and 10th respectively, for the first half of 2021.

Online Tournaments
 
In response to demand from customers for online esports tournaments which was in all likelihood triggered by the social distancing protocols attendant to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced in March 2020 an initiative of online esports tournaments. Since March 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Simplicity Esports LLC, we have been holding online esports tournaments in the United States. In addition, we commenced promoting these weekly online tournaments via text messages to our database of over 400,000 paying esports gaming center customers, which we acquired in our acquisition of PLAYlive. If we can convert merely 1% of these existing customers from the PLAYlive database to play in our paid online tournaments, we anticipate this business unit may generate approximately $1 million in annual revenues. At a 5% conversion rate, this business segment may generate approximately $5 million in annual revenue. Management also intends to sell sponsorship and marketing activations for these online tournaments which would create additional revenue. We also announced our initiative to offer play at home online tournaments in Brazil. These tournaments are a way for us to engage with our customer base from home during periods of required social distancing or quarantine.
Our Gaming Centers
 
As of August 30, 2021, we have 28 operational locations (16 corporate locations and 12 franchise locations), through our subsidiaries throughout the U.S., giving casual gamers the opportunity to play in a social setting with other members of the gaming community. In addition, aspiring and established professional gamers have an opportunity to compete in local and national esports tournaments held in our gaming centers for prizes, notoriety, and potential contracts to play for one of our professional esports teams. In this business unit, revenue is generated from franchise royalties, the sale of game time, memberships, tournament entry fees, birthday party events, corporate party events, concessions and gaming-related merchandise.
 
Our business plan encompasses a brick and click physical and digital approach to further recognize revenue from all verticals, which we believe to be unique in the industry. The physical centers, together with our esports teams, lifestyle brand and marketing campaigns offer opportunities for additional revenue via strategic partnerships with both endemic and non-endemic brands. Our ultimate goal is to further engage a diverse fan base with a 360-degree approach driving traffic to both our digital platform, tournaments (online and in-person), and physical real estate to maximize the monetization opportunities with these relationships. In addition, we have proprietary intellectual capital, fan engagement strategies and brand development blueprints which complement our publicly available information.
 
Optimally, the esports gaming centers of Simplicity Esports LLC (“Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers”) will measure between 2,000 and 4,000 square feet, with dozens of gaming stations. The Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers will feature cutting edge technology, futuristic aesthetic décor and dynamic high-speed gaming equipment. We believe our brick-and-click strategy will present attractive opportunities for sponsors and advertisers to connect with our audience, creating an intriguing monetization opportunity for sponsors and advertisers. Currently our company owned stores operate in approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space in desirable, high traffic locations.

Creating content that engages fans, sponsors and developers, while promoting our brand is one of our primary goals. In August 2021, we announced a partnership with Television Korea 24 (“ESTV”) to provide esports and gaming content for their 24-7 live linear channel around the world. ESTV can be viewed in over 45 countries including the U.S. and Brazil. We seek to reach a broad demographic encompassing the casual, amateur and professional gaming community. Our philosophy is to enhance our footprint for both endemic and non-endemic partnerships. We believe we possess a deep perception of our markets and understand the new age of branding while maintaining authenticity to the gaming community that comprises our fanbase.
 
As a result of COVID-19 (discussed below), all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020 and have since reopened 16 corporate and 12 franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers as of August 30, 2021, the majority of which are operating at restricted capacity based on local COVID-19 regulations. See “Risk Factors—Public health epidemics or outbreaks, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely impact our business.”
 
Corporate Gaming Centers 
 
As of year end May 31, 2021, through our subsidiary entities, we currently operate 15 corporate-owned retail Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, one of which was acquired during the third fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2021 and two of which were acquired in the fourth fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2021. Subsequent to year end, we added one additional gaming center. Furthermore, we have engaged a national tenant representation real estate broker to assist in the strategic planning and negotiations for our future Simplicity Esports Gaming Center locations. We contemplate that new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers will be funded by us as well as a combination of tenant improvement allowances from landlords and sponsorships. The Company intends to continue the expansion of its corporate owned esports gaming center footprint through the buildout of new esports gaming centers. The disruptions in commercial real estate caused by COVID-19 lockdowns have allowed the Company to strengthen its existing relationships with national landlords by signing new locations with percentage rent leases. The locations will range between 2,000 and 4,000 sq ft and be primarily located inside of shopping malls.
 
As announced in June 2020, we are in discussions with commercial property owners regarding their desire to have us open 7,000 to 12,000 square foot Arenas at their properties. There are multiple locations available to us with a percentage of gross sales rent lease structure (as opposed to fixed rent payments), and construction funds offered by the landlord to assist with the build out and equipping of our planned Arenas. These Arenas are planned as hubs in our hub and spoke model that will see smaller corporate and franchisee owned gaming centers as spokes connected to Arenas as hubs for larger events and tournaments.
 
Franchised Gaming Centers
 
Due to interest from potential franchisees, in 2019 we launched a franchising program to accelerate the expansion of our planned nationwide footprint. We sell specific franchise territories, through our wholly owned subsidiary PLAYlive, and assist with the establishment and buildout of esports gaming centers to potential business owners that desire to use our branding, infrastructure and process to open and operate gaming centers. We currently operate 12 fully constructed franchise esports gaming centers. The 12 franchise owned gaming centers that we have acquired to date generated over $1 million of revenue in the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 despite operating with limited capacity due to COVID-19 restrictions. Due to interest from potential franchisees, we have launched a franchising program to accelerate the expansion of our planned nationwide footprint. We sell specific franchise territories, through our wholly owned subsidiary PLAYlive, and assist with the establishment and buildout of esports gaming centers to potential business owners that desire to use our branding, infrastructure and process to open and operate gaming centers. Franchise revenue is generated from the sale of franchise territories, supplying furniture, equipment and merchandise to the franchisees for buildout of their centers, a gross sales royalty fee and a national marketing fee. We license the use of our branding, assist in identifying and negotiating commercial locations, assist in overseeing the buildout and development, provide access to proprietary software for point of sale, inventory management, employee training and other HR functions. Franchisees also have an opportunity to participate in our national esports tournament events, and benefit from the growing profile of our professional esports teams. Once an esports gaming center is opened, we provide operational guidance, support and use of branding elements in exchange for a monthly royalty fee calculated as 6% of gross sales. On January 1, 2020, we implemented a national marketing fee of 1% of gross sales. To date, we have sold five of these franchise territories. COVID-19 travel restrictions caused us to suspend the sale of new franchise territories from April 1, 2020 until October 1, 2020. During this time, a pipeline of interested applicants has accumulated, and we anticipate new franchise territory sales over the next 12 months as a result.


The combination of the esports gaming centers, owned or franchised by our wholly owned subsidiaries Simplicity Esports LLC or PLAYlive, provides us with what we believe is one of the largest esports gaming center footprints in North America. Over the next 12 months, existing PLAYlive esports gaming centers will be rebranded to Simplicity Esports gaming centers. All newly opened franchise esports gaming centers will be branded as Simplicity Esports gaming centers and have numerous gaming PC’s. All gaming centers in our footprint will be participating venues in our national esports tournaments.

Franchise Roll Up Strategy
 
We began implementing a franchise roll-up strategy in July 2020 as a result of the disruption caused by COVID-19 related stay at home orders, and the disruption it caused to the commercial real estate market. The reduction in revenues for some franchisees because of stay-at-home orders, and government mandates to remain closed created significant accrued rent payments due to landlords. We have been able to come to terms with many franchisees to acquire the assets of their gaming centers and make them corporate owned. We have simultaneously negotiated new leases with some of the largest national mall chains, including Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management, and are in the process of negotiating additional locations with other landlords. The new leases involve significant reductions in or elimination of fixed rent and the addition of percentage of revenues rent terms. During the fiscal year we signed 13 letters of intent and executed definitive agreements for all of those locations, most of which were operational prior to year-end. We expect each of these locations to be profitable as a result of the significant reduced rent expense via the percentage rent structure.
Our Stream Team
 
The Simplicity Esports LLC and Flamengo Esports stream teams encompass over 20 commentators (commonly known as “casters”), influencers and personalities who connect to a dedicated fan base. Our electric group of live personalities represent our organization to the fullest with their own unique style. We are proud to support and present a diverse group of gamers as we engage fans across a multiple of esports genres. Our Twitch affiliation has enabled our stream team influences to reach a broad fan base. Additionally, we have created several niches within the streaming community which has enabled us to engage fans within certain titles on a 24/7 basis. Our notoriety in the industry is evidenced by our audience that views millions of minutes of Simplicity Esports’ and Flamengo Esports’ content monthly, via various social media outlets including YouTube, Twitter and Twitch. Through Simplicity Esports LLC, we have begun to implement a unique approach to ensure the ultimate fan friendly esports experience. Our intention is to have gamers involved at the grassroots level and feel a sense of unity as we compete with top class talent. Our management and players are known within the esports community and we plan to use their skills to create a seamless content creation plan helping gamers feel closer to our brand than any other in the industry.
Material Acquisitions and Licensing
 
Acquisition of Simplicity Esports, LLC
 
On January 4, 2019, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain share exchange agreement, dated December 21, 2018 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Share Exchange Agreement, dated December 28, 2018 and by Amendment No. 2 to Share Exchange Agreement, dated December 30, 2018, the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, Simplicity Esports, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Simplicity Esports LLC”), each of the equity holders of Simplicity Esports LLC (“Simplicity Owners”) and Jed Kaplan, in the capacity as the representative of the Simplicity Owners (the “Representative”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement the Simplicity Owners transferred all the issued and outstanding equity interests of Simplicity Esports LLC to the Company in exchange for an aggregate of 375,000 (3,000,000 pre-reverse split) shares of common stock of the Company (the “Simplicity Esports Acquisition”). As of January 4, 2019, upon the completion of the Simplicity Esports Acquisition, esports gaming became the primary business of the Company.
 
On January 4, 2019, the Simplicity Owners received an aggregate of 37,500 (300,000 pre-reverse split) shares of common stock at the closing of the Acquisition and an additional aggregate of 87,500 (700,000 pre-reverse split) shares of common stock on January 7, 2019. The Simplicity Owners were initially entitled to receive an additional 250,000 (2,000,000 pre-reverse split) shares upon the Company’s receipt of the approval of its stockholders to such issuance. This condition was removed as the stockholder approval was only necessary due to the Company’s stock being listed on Nasdaq. Upon completion of the Simplicity Esports LLC acquisition, the Company decided that moving off the Nasdaq was appropriate, and the 250,000 (2,000,000 pre-reverse split) shares were issued to the Simplicity Owners on March 27, 2019.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC, on January 2, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate Amendment”) with the Delaware Secretary of State to change the Company’s name from “Smaaash Entertainment, Inc.” to “Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company”. In addition, the Company changed the ticker symbols of its common stock and public warrants to “WINR” and “WINRW,” respectively, and commenced trading of its common stock and public warrants under such new ticker symbols on the OTCQB on January 10, 2019.

Acquisition of PLAYlive Nation, Inc.
 
On July 30, 2019, we acquired a 100% interest in PLAYlive by way of merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 25, 2019, whereby we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PLAYlive from the selling stockholders (“PLAYlive Stockholders”) of PLAYlive in exchange for 150,000 (750,000 shares pre-reverse split) shares of our common stock. Following this merger, PLAYlive became our wholly owned subsidiary. On the closing date of this merger, each of the PLAYlive Stockholders entered into a one-year lock-up agreement with the Company and each of Duncan Wood, Jordan C. Jenson, and Alec T. Carpenter entered into an employment agreement with PLAYlive.
 
Licensing of Flamengo Esports
 
Effective January 20, 2020, Simplicity One Brasil entered into an Exclusive Trademark and Symbol Use License Agreement, and Other Covenants (the “License Agreement”), dated November 5, 2019 with Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (one of the most successful Brazilian sports organizations, known for its world-famous soccer team), whereby Clube de Regatas do Flamengo agreed to exclusively license its intellectual property rights (“Flamengo IP Rights”) to Simplicity One Brasil (an entity which the Company and Team One E-Sports Ltda – ME owned a 90% and 10% equity interest in, respectively), authorizing Simplicity One Brasil to use the Flamengo IP Rights on a League of Legends team in esports as well as in other modalities in esports, which will be maintained and assembled by Simplicity One Brasil during the term of the Licensing Agreement. The License Agreement has a term of three years, beginning on January 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2022, and may be renewed by mutual written agreement by the parties. In exchange for the exclusive license, the Company shall pay Clube de Regatas do Flamengo an annual fee for the first, second and third year in the amount of $32,300 (Reais$170,000.00), $35,150 (Reais$185,000.00), and $38,000 (Reais$200,000.00), respectively, as well as the payment of royalties in the amount of 8% of the gross revenues (less taxes) of the eSports teams pursuant to the terms of the Licensing Agreement. If either party unilaterally terminates the Agreement or gives rise to certain termination grounds set forth in the Agreement, the terminating party will pay the other party a non-compensatory fine in the amount of approximately $19,000 (Reais $100,000) to indemnify the other party, without prejudice to any losses or damages that exceed such amount.
 
Flamengo Esports was established in 2017 as the Esports division of Clube de Regatas do Flamengo, a successful Brazilian sports organization, known for its world-famous soccer team. Flamengo Esports’ League of Legends® team won the CBLoL Championship in September 2019 and competed at the 2019 League of Legends® World Championship in Europe as one of 24 teams from 13 different regions around the world.
 
On April 1, 2020, the Company released multiple players and staff members from Simplicity One Brasil Ltd as part of a restructuring in an effort to make the Flamengo Esports project profitable. The Company was approved for ownership of a franchise spot in League of Legends Brazil (CBLoL) in October 2020.
 
In June 2020, while Simplicity One Brasil was preparing its initial application for purchasing from Riot Games a franchise in Campeonato Brasileiro de League of Legends, Simplicity One Brasil become aware that the 10%-ownership interest of Team One E-Sports Ltda (“Team One E-Sports”) in Simplicity One Brasil was in contravention of Riot Games’ policy that only one League of Legend esports team could be owned by an owner at one time because Team One had already submitted an application for purchasing a franchise for another League of Legend esports team. Accordingly, Simplicity One Brasil needed Team One E-Sports to divest itself of its 10%-equity interest in Simplicity One Brasil in order for Simplicity One Brasil to proceed with its franchise application. Therefore, on June 22, 2020, Mr. Kaplan entered into a Quota Purchase Agreement with Team One E-Sports, pursuant to which Mr. Kaplan acquired Team One Esports’ 10%-ownership equity interest for $45,000 in cash. In addition, the Company transferred a 2%-equity interest (an aggregate of 4%) to each of Laila De Braga Cavalcanti Loss and Frederico Tannure. Ms. Loss lives in Brazil and run the operations of Simplicity One Brasil, in order to comply with Riot Games’ policy requiring local ownership in Brazil in order to apply for a franchise of a league of legends sports team. Furthermore, on June 22, 2020, Mr. Kaplan agreed to forgive the debt of the Kaplan Promissory Note with a principal balance of $90,000 in exchange for the Company assigning to Mr. Kaplan a 10% equity interest in Simplicity One Brasil. In light of the restructuring of the ownership interest in Simplicity One Brasil, as of August 30, 2021, the Company, Mr. Kaplan, Ms. Cavalcanti Loss, and Mr. Tannure own a 76%, 20%, 2% and 2% equity interest in Simplicity One Brasil.
 
COVID-19
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to several other countries and infections have been reported globally.
 
Because COVID-19 infections have been reported throughout the United States, certain federal, state and local governmental authorities have issued stay-at-home orders, proclamations and/or directives aimed at minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Additional, more restrictive proclamations and/or directives may be issued in the future. As a result, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020 and have since reopened 15 corporate and 12 franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers, the majority of which are operating at restricted capacity based on local COVID-19 regulations. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Gaming Centers require a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers are operating, a limited number of the franchisees of Simplicity Gaming Centers have defaulted on their obligations to pay their minimum monthly royalty payment to us. This has resulted in either an increase in accounts receivables or a bad debt expense where account receivables are no longer collectible due to franchisee’s inability to pay the minimum monthly royalty payments owed by the franchisee. As of May 31, 2021, we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $28 thousand and have written off $112 thousand, partly in conjunction with taking back certain franchises and converting them to company owned stores. We have experienced an increase in our account receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $32 thousand during the year ended May 31, 2021 and an increase of $128 thousand for the year ended May 31, 2020, as there were no accounts receivable at year end May 31, 2019. Notwithstanding our efforts to support franchisees and still collect on receivables, it is unclear exactly how much of the increase in accounts receivables is attributable to the impact of COVID-19. We have waived the minimum monthly royalty payment obligations from July 2020 through present day and are instead billing the franchisees a true-up of 6% of gross sales without a minimum. We continue to assess possible similar accommodations to the franchisees in light of the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the disruptions in commercial real estate caused by COVID-19 lockdowns have allowed the Company to strengthen its existing relationships with national landlords by signing new locations with percentage rent leases.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The measures taken to date adversely impacted the Company’s business during the year ended May 31, 2021 and will potentially continue to impact the Company’s business. Management expects that all of its business segments, across all of its geographies, will be impacted to some degree, but the significance of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company’s business and the duration for which it may have an impact cannot be determined at this time.


Corporate History
 
Formation
 
We were initially a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 17, 2017 under the name I-AM Capital Acquisition Company. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we were not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we focused on businesses with a connection to India. On November 20, 2018, we changed our name from I-AM Capital Acquisition Company to Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. On January 2, 2019, we changed our name from Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. to Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company.
Smaaash Entertainment Private Limited
 
Business Combination
 
On November 20, 2018, the Company and Smaaash Entertainment Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of India (“Smaaash Private”), consummated the transactions (the “Transactions” or the “Business Combination”) contemplated by the share subscription agreement (as amended, the “Subscription Agreement”), following the approval at the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company held on November 9, 2018 (the “Special Meeting”).
 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the purchase price of $150,000 was paid by the Company to Smaaash Private in exchange for 294,360 newly issued equity shares of Smaaash Private at the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), representing less than 1% of Smaaash Private at such time.
 
At the time of the Closing, AHA Holdings Private Limited (“AHA Holdings”) and Shripal Morakhia (together with AHA Holdings, the “Smaaash Founders”) agreed to transfer all of their ownership interest in Smaaash Private (the “Additional Smaaash Shares”) to the Company in exchange for newly issued shares of our Common Stock (the “Transferred Company Shares”).
 
In furtherance of the foregoing, at the Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of 250,000 shares of its common stock to the Smaaash Founders as an upfront portion of the Transferred Company Shares (the “Upfront Company Shares”). In connection with the issuance of the Upfront Company Shares, the Company and the Smaaash Founders entered into an escrow agreement pursuant to which the Upfront Company Shares would be held in escrow and will be either, (i) if the Additional Smaaash Shares are not transferred in full to the Company within the designated six-month period, cancelled, or (ii) if the Additional Smaaash Shares are transferred in full to the Company within the designated six-month period, released from escrow and the number of Upfront Company Shares will be deducted from the Transferred Company Shares that will be issued to the Smaaash Founders upon the delivery of the Additional Smaaash Shares. Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, the Upfront Company Shares have been cancelled because the Additional Smaaash Shares were not transferred in full to the Company in the designated six-month period.
 
In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name from I-AM Capital Acquisition Company to Smaaash Entertainment Inc. changed its stock symbols for its Common Stock, Public Rights and Public Warrants to “IAM,” “IAMXR,” and “IAMXW,” respectively, and entered into a master franchise agreement (“Master Franchise Agreement”) and a master license and distribution agreement (“Master Distribution Agreement”) with Smaaash Private.

The Notice stated that after its Business Combination, the Company had not demonstrated that its common stock met Listing Rule 5505(b)(1) that requires a market value of publicly held shares of at least $15 million. Additionally, the Company has not provided evidence that its common stock has at least 300 round lot holders as required by Listing Rule 5505(a)(3) and that its warrant has at least 400 round lot holders as required by Listing Rule 5515(a)(4).

31-60 | 120% of Principal Amount so paid 
61-90 | 125% of Principal Amount so paid 
91-180 | 135% of Principal Amount so paid 

 
135% of the remaining unpaid and unconverted Principal Amount, plus all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable on the Maturity Date. “Principal Amount” refers to the sum of (i) the original principal amount of the Harbor Gates Note (including the OID); (ii) all guaranteed and other accrued but unpaid interest under the Harbor Gates Note; (iii) any fees due under the Harbor Gates Notes; (iv) liquidated damages; and (v) any default payments owing under the Harbor Gates Note, in each case previously paid or added to the Principal Amount.

(ii) | In the event the average of the three volume weighted average prices for the Company’s common stock during the three consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date which is the 180th day following the Effective Date is less than $8.00 per share, then Harbor Gates will be entitled, and the Company will issue to Harbor Gates additional shares of common stock as set forth in the Harbor Gates Note. 

 
If an Event of Default (as defined in the Promissory Note) occurs, the outstanding Principal Amount of the Harbor Gates Note owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at Harbor Gates’ election, immediately due and payable in cash at the “Mandatory Default Amount”. The Mandatory Default Amount means 35% of the outstanding Principal Amount of the Harbor Gates Note will be automatically added to the Principal Sum of the Harbor Gates Note and tack back to the Effective Date for purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the 1934 Act. Commencing five days after the occurrence of any Event of Default that results in the eventual acceleration of the Harbor Gates Note, the Harbor Gates Note will accrue additional interest, in addition to the Harbor Gates Note’s “guaranteed” interest, at a rate equal to the lesser of 20% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.
 
If the Harbor Gates Note is not retired on or before the Maturity Date, then at any time and from time to time after the Maturity Date, and subject to the terms hereof and restrictions and limitations contained in the Harbor Gates Note, Harbor Gates has the right, at Harbor Gates’ sole option, to convert in whole or in part the outstanding and unpaid Principal Amount under the Harbor Gates Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at the Variable Conversion Price.

Steinberger, Eric J. Charneski, Jordan C. Jenson, and Alec T. Carpenter (collectively, Messrs. Wood, Steinberger, Charneski, Jenson and Carpenter are referred to herein as the “PLAYlive Stockholders”), and Mr. Wood in his capacity as representative of the Stockholders (the “Stockholder Representative”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of PLAYlive by way of a merger (the “PLAYlive Merger”) pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into PLAYlive, with PLAYlive surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Merger Consideration”). The PLAYlive Merger closed on July 30, 2019.
 
The name of the surviving corporation remained “PLAYlive Nation, Inc.,” the Certificate of Incorporation of the surviving corporation is the certificate of incorporation of PLAYlive, and the bylaws of the surviving corporation are the bylaws of PLAYlive. The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the PLAYlive Merger became the directors and officers, respectively, of PLAYlive.
 
At the effective time of the PLAYlive Merger, by virtue of the PLAYlive Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, PLAYlive or the holders of shares of PLAYlive common stock, each share of PLAYlive common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the PLAYlive Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement was cancelled and extinguished and was converted automatically into the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares of PLAYlive common stock as provided in the Merger Agreement. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of PLAYlive. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares continues to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of PLAYlive.
 
Promptly following the effective time of the PLAYlive Merger, the Company made available for exchange in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement that portion of the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement in exchange for outstanding PLAYlive common stock, provided, however, that the Company deposited into escrow 75,000 shares of Company common stock out of the aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise issuable to the PLAYlive Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement as partial security for the indemnification obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the PLAYlive Merger. The number of shares of Company common stock issued to each PLAYlive Stockholder in connection with the PLAYlive Merger (after aggregating all fractional shares of Company common stock that otherwise would have been received by such holder) were rounded up to the next whole share in lieu of such fractional share.

Within 60 days after the closing date, the Company may deliver a notice to the Stockholder Representative setting forth a description of any item which caused Minimum Cash to exceed or fall below $10,000 and the actual amount of Minimum Cash on deposit in PLAYlive’s principal bank account as of the closing (a “Minimum Cash Adjustment Notice”). If the actual amount of Minimum Cash as of the closing is more than $10,000, then the Company will pay to the Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the PLAYlive Stockholders), the amount by which Minimum Cash exceeds $10,000 provided, however, in no event shall the cash payment exceed an amount that will permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to qualify for the intended tax treatment. If the actual amount of Minimum Cash as of the closing is less than $10,000, then the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the PLAYlive Stockholders) will pay to the Company the amount by which Minimum Cash is less than $10,000.
 
Concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement, the PLAYlive Stockholders executed and delivered a restrictive covenant agreement as provided in the Merger Agreement. At closing, each of Messrs. Wood, Jenson, and Carpenter entered into an employment agreement with PLAYlive, and each of the PLAYlive Stockholders entered into a one-year lock-up agreement with the Company.

We intend to list our common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market or NYSE American. There is no assurance that our listing application will be approved by the Nasdaq Capital Market or NYSE American.

On August 17, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 20,000,000 to 36,000,000. Accordingly, our authorized capital stock consists of (i) 36,000,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
 
On November 17, 2020, our board of directors approved the reverse stock split in a ratio of 1-for-8 and on November 17, 2020, we filed an amended and restated certificate of amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, implementing the reverse stock split in a ratio of 1-for-8, effective November 19, 2020; provided, however, the reverse stock split became effective for trading purposes on November 20, 2020 when it had been processed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). The reverse stock split is intended to allow us to meet the minimum share price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market or NYSE American.
