ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Background
 Arko Corp. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on August 26, 2020 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation, and ARKO Holdings Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel, which we refer to as Arko Holdings. Our shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“common stock”), and publicly-traded warrants were registered to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 22, 2020 and commenced trading on December 23, 2020. Our common stock has traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”) since December 24, 2020 and we are subject to the reporting requirements of the TASE.  Arko Holdings was organized under the laws of Israel on May 4, 1970 and the main activity of Arko Holdings prior to the foregoing business combination was its holding, through its subsidiaries, of controlling rights in GPM Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 12, 2002, which we refer to as GPM. Arko Holdings’ Bonds (Series C) have traded on the TASE since June 28, 2016 and will be fully redeemed on March 30, 2021. Once the bonds are redeemed, Arko Holdings will cease to be a “reporting entity” under the Securities Law, 5728-1968, of the State of Israel.
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Company,” “ARKO,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” and “us” refer to ARKO Corp. including its consolidated subsidiaries.  We maintain a website at www.arkocorp.com.  Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Overview 
 We own, indirectly, 100% of GPM, which is our operating entity. Based in Richmond, VA, we are a leading independent convenience store operator and, as of December 31, 2020, we were the seventh largest convenience store chain in the United States ranked by store count, operating 1,330 retail convenience stores. As of December 31, 2020, we operated the stores under 17 regional store brands including 1-Stop, Admiral, Apple Market®, BreadBox, E-Z Mart®, fas mart®, fastmarket®, Jiffi Stop®, Li’l Cricket, Next Door Store®, Roadrunner Markets, Rstore, Scotchman®, shore stop®, Town Star, Village Pantry® and Young’s. As of December 31, 2020, we also supplied fuel to 1,614 dealer-operated gas stations. We are well diversified geographically and as of December 31, 2020, operated across 33 states and the District of Columbia in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern and Southwestern United States (“U.S.”). 
 We derive our revenue from the retail sale of fuel and the products offered in our stores, and the wholesale distribution of fuel. Our retail stores offer a wide array of cold and hot foodservice, beverages, cigarettes and other tobacco products, candy, salty snacks, grocery, beer and general merchandise. As of December 31, 2020, we had foodservice offerings at over 250 company-operated stores. The foodservice category includes hot and fresh foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and/or other prepared foods. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had over 70 branded quick service restaurants consisting of major national brands. Additionally, we provide a number of traditional convenience store services that generate additional income, including lottery, prepaid products, gift cards, money orders, ATMs, gaming, and other ancillary product and service offerings. We also generate car wash revenue at approximately 100 of our locations. 
 The Business 
 We primarily operate in two business segments: retail and wholesale. Additionally, our third segment, GPMP, engages in the wholesale distribution of fuel.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, the retail segment generated total revenue of approximately $3.5 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion of in-store sales and other revenues. In addition, the retail segment sold a total of 937.1 million gallons of branded and unbranded fuel to its retail customers. As a wholesale distributor of motor fuel, we distribute branded and unbranded motor fuel from refiners through third-party transportation providers.  As of December 31, 2020, we distributed fuel to 1,614 dealer locations and a small number of bulk purchasers throughout our footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the wholesale segment sold 267.3 million gallons of fuel, generating revenues of approximately $418.0 million. In January 2016, our subsidiary, GPM Petroleum LP, which we refer to as GPMP, began the wholesale distribution of motor fuels on a fixed fee per gallon basis to both our controlled convenience stores and third parties.  GPM purchases all of its fuel from GPMP, of which we own 100% of the general partner of GPMP and, as of December 31, 2020, 99.71% of the GPMP limited partner units. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 99.8% of the total fuel gallons distributed by GPMP were to our locations.

Retail Business 
 As of December 31, 2020, we operated 1,330 retail convenience stores. The stores offer a wide array of cold and hot foodservice, beverages, cigarettes and other tobacco products, candy, salty snacks, grocery, beer and general merchandise. A limited number of stores do not sell fuel. As of December 31, 2020, we operated our stores under 17 regional store brands, including 1-Stop, Admiral, Apple Market®, BreadBox, E-Z Mart®, fas mart®, fastmarket®, Jiffi Stop®, Li’l Cricket, Next Door Store®, Roadrunner Markets, Rstore, Scotchman®, shore stop®, Town Star, Village Pantry® and Young’s. 
 In October 2017, we entered into an agreement to develop 10 Dunkin’ restaurants in the tri-cities area (Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky) by May 2023 and subsequently amended this agreement to extend the development deadline to October 2023.  We opened the first site in November 2018, the second in May 2019 and the third in November 2020. Three additional sites have received approval from Dunkin’ and two are planned to be opened in 2021 and one in 2022. 
 We offer foodservice at over 250 company-operated stores. The foodservice category includes hot and fresh foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill and other prepared foods. We offer a value food menu consisting of items such as hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. In addition, we operate over 70 branded quick service restaurants consisting of major national brands, including Blimpies, Dunkin’, Dairy Queen, Krystal, Subway, Taco Bell, Noble Romans and two full service restaurants. We provide a number of traditional convenience store services that generate additional income, including lottery, prepaid products, gift cards, money orders, ATMs, gaming, and other ancillary product and service offerings. We also generate revenue from car washes at approximately 100 of our locations. 
 Wholesale Business 
 Our wholesale segment supplies fuel products to independent fueling station operators on a consignment basis, as well as final sales of fuel to independent operators and bulk purchasers on a fixed-margin basis. Under consignment arrangements, of which there were 236 as of December 31, 2020, we continue to own the fuel until the final sale to customers at independently operated gas stations, and we set the retail price at which it is sold. Gross profit generated from the sale is divided between us and the operator (or “consignment agent”) according to the terms of the applicable consignment agreement. In certain cases, gross profit is split by a percentage and in others, a fixed fee per gallon is paid to the operator. Alternatively, we make final sales to independent operators (referred to as “lessee-dealers” if the operators lease the station from us or “open-dealers” if they control the site) and bulk purchasers on a fixed-fee basis. Typically, fuel margin reflects our total fuel costs (including transportation costs, prompt pay discounts and rebates) under these arrangements, largely eliminating our exposure to commodity price movements. Additionally, we lease space to, and collect rent from, consignment agents and lessee-dealers at sites under our control. The Empire Acquisition (as defined below) added significant scale to our wholesale segment in terms of fuel gallons sold (including 195 sites on a consignment basis) and materially increased our footprint by adding 10 new states and the District of Columbia. 
Empire Acquisition 
 In October 2020, we consummated our acquisition of the business of Empire Petroleum Partners, LLC, which we refer to as “Empire”, for $353 million paid at closing plus an additional $20 million to be paid in equal annual installments over five years, and potential post-closing contingent amounts of up to an additional $45 million.  We refer to the foregoing as the “Empire Acquisition”. 
 As of the date of the acquisition, Empire was one of the largest and most geographically diversified wholesale fuel distributors in the United States, distributing motor fuel to 1,453 independently operated fueling stations in 30 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to supplying third party sites, Empire directly operated 84 convenience stores. As a result of the Empire Acquisition, we currently operate stores or supply fuel in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Empire sold branded and unbranded fuel products to customers on both fixed margin and consignment bases under long-term contracts. Empire maintained relationships with all major oil companies, enabling Empire to offer customers a broad portfolio of fuel brands and security of supply. 
 Trends Impacting Our Business 
 We operate within the large and growing U.S. convenience store industry. According to National Association of Convenience Stores, the U.S. convenience store industry has grown in-store sales from $182.4 billion in 2009 to $251.9 billion in 2019, which represents a combined annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.3%. Pretax income for the industry also grew from $4.8 billion in 2009 to $11.9 billion in 2019, representing a CAGR of 9.5%. 
 The U.S. convenience store industry remains highly fragmented, with the 10 largest convenience store retailers accounting for less than 20% of the store base in the United States in 2020. 7-Eleven, Inc., the largest operator of convenience stores in the U.S., recently announced the acquisition of the Speedway chain of convenience stores and, assuming completion of that transaction, it is 
 2

expected to control approximately 9% of the industry’s store count. Total convenience store count decreased by 1.6% to 150,274 in 2020 compared to 2019, of which 92,169 stores were single-store operators, which saw a decline of 3.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. 
 We have achieved strong store growth over the last several years, primarily by implementing a highly successful acquisition strategy. From 2013 through 2020, we completed 18 acquisitions. As a result, our site count, including retail and wholesale, has grown from 320 sites in 2011 to 2,944 sites as of December 31, 2020. These strategic acquisitions have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on our reported results and can make period to period comparisons of results difficult. We completed one significant acquisition in 2020 – the acquisition of the business of Empire. The Empire Acquisition added to our business the direct operation of 84 convenience stores and the supply of fuel to 1,453 independently operated fueling stations in 30 states and the District of Columbia. With our achievement of significant size and scale, we have added an additional focus of organic growth, including implementing company-wide marketing and merchandising initiatives, which we believe will result in significant value accretion to all the assets we have acquired. We believe that this complementary strategy will help further our growth through both acquisitions and organically and improve our results of operations.  We also plan to pursue accretive opportunities that will help execute our overall strategy.
 There is an ongoing trend in the convenience store industry focused on increasing and improving in-store foodservice offerings, including fresh foods, quick service restaurants and proprietary food offerings. We believe consumers may be more likely to patronize convenience stores that include such new and improved food offerings, which may also lead to increased inside merchandise sales or fuel sales for such stores. Although our foodservice sales have been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe this trend will reverse when the effects of the pandemic subside.  Our current foodservice offering primarily consists of hot and fresh foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. We have historically relied upon a limited number of franchised quick service restaurants and in-store delis to drive customer traffic rather than other foodservice offerings. As a result, we believe that our under-penetration of foodservice presents an opportunity to expand foodservice offerings and margin in response to changing consumer behavior. In addition, we believe that continued investment in new technology platforms and applications to adapt to evolving consumer eating preferences, including contactless checkout, order ahead service, and delivery, will further drive growth in profitability. 
 Our operations are significantly impacted by the retail fuel margins we receive on gallons sold. While we expect our same stores fuel sales volumes to remain stable over time, even though they were recently impacted by COVID-19, and the fuel margins we realize on those sales to remain stable, these fuel margins can change rapidly as they are influenced by many factors, including: the price of refined products; interruptions in supply caused by severe weather; severe refinery mechanical failures for an extended period of time; and competition in the local markets in which we operate. 
 The cost of our main products, gasoline and diesel, is greatly impacted by the wholesale cost of fuel in the United States. We attempt to pass along wholesale fuel cost changes to our customers through retail price changes; however, we are not always able to do so. The timing of any related increase or decrease in retail prices is affected by competitive conditions. As a result, we tend to experience lower fuel margins when the cost of fuel is increasing gradually over a longer period and higher fuel margins when the cost of fuel is declining or more volatile over a shorter period of time. Also, rising prices tend to cause our customers to reduce discretionary fuel consumption, which tends to reduce our fuel sales volumes. 
 We also operate in a highly competitive retail convenience market that includes businesses with operations and services that are similar to those that are provided by us. We face significant competition from other large chain operators. In particular, large convenience store chains have increased their number of locations and remodeled their existing locations in recent years, enhancing their competitive position. We believe that convenience stores managed by individual operators who offer branded or non-branded fuel are also significant competitors in the market. The convenience store industry is also experiencing competition from other retail sectors including grocery stores, large warehouse retail stores, dollar stores and pharmacies. 
 The U.S. convenience store industry has proven to be recession resilient, as demonstrated by the designation of convenience stores as essential businesses during the statewide shutdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, as consumers grew wary of visiting comparatively high-touch grocery stores during the pandemic, convenience stores drew more “fill-in” visits for various food and other grocery items. We believe that convenience retail is a dynamic industry that flexes and evolves with changing consumer preference and will continue to do so as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 We believe that we will continue to benefit from several key industry trends and characteristics, including: 
  
• | Continued opportunities to compete more effectively and grow through acquisitions as a result of industry fragmentation and ongoing consolidation trend;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing size of retail stores, specifically supermarkets and large format hypermarkets, driving consumers to small box retailers, such as convenience stores, to meet their demand for speed and convenience in daily shopping needs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Changing consumer demographics, shopping habits and eating patterns as a result of the continually evolving COVID-19 pandemic will require convenience store operators to alter foodservice and product offerings inside the store and this presents an opportunity as we expand foodservice offerings to meet changing consumer preferences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While consumption of cigarettes, a major product category for convenience store retailers, has declined nationwide, U.S. convenience store industry in-store sales and profits have continued to increase as retailers shift offerings to higher margin products, such as other tobacco products, packaged and dispensed beverages and foodservice;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. national fuel margin is trending higher from an average of 17.1 cents per gallon from 2009 through 2013 to an average of 22.2 cents per gallon from 2014 through 2019, increasing to an average of 35.2 cents per gallon in 2020 (OPIS Retail Year in Review)—a result of large fuel suppliers exiting the convenience store market as well as operators pricing more rationally to recuperate gradually increasing operating costs and declining tobacco sales;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued investment in new technology platforms and applications to adapt to new consumer preferences including speed of convenience, contactless and order ahead service, and delivery; and

Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and contribute to our continued success: 
 Leading industry consolidator with a proven track record of integrating acquisitions and generating strong returns on capital. We are one of the largest and most active consolidators in the highly-fragmented convenience store industry. Between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2020, we completed 18 acquisitions, expanding our retail store count approximately 4.2x. As an experienced acquiror, we have demonstrated the ability to generate strong returns on capital and meaningfully improve target performance post-integration through operating expertise and economies of scale. We believe that continued scale advantage has enabled us to become a formidable industry player, enhanced our competitiveness, and positioned us as an acquirer of choice within the industry. We also believe that the recently consummated Empire Acquisition will allow us to grow our wholesale channel by acquiring supply contracts from independent operators in addition to retail convenience store and wholesale fuel portfolios and will enhance our cash flow profile and diversification. 
 Leading Market Position in Highly Attractive, Diversified and Contiguous Markets. As of December 31, 2020, our network consists of approximately 2,950 locations across 33 states and the District of Columbia. We are well diversified across geographies in the Midwest, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southwest and Northeast regions of the United States. We have traditionally acquired a majority of our stores in smaller towns with less concentration of national-chain convenience stores. We believe that our focus on secondary and tertiary markets allows us to preserve “local” brand name recognition and aligns local market needs with capital investment. 
 Entrenched Local Brands with Scale of Large Store Portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, we operated our stores under 17 regional brand names (which we consider to be “a Family of Community Brands”). Upon closing of an acquisition, rather than rebranding a group of stores, we have typically left the existing store name in place leveraging customer familiarity and loyalty associated with the local brand. We believe we benefit greatly from the established brand equity in our portfolio of store banners acquired over time. Our acquired brands have been in existence for an average of approximately 50 years and each brand, with its respective long-term community involvement, is highly recognizable to local customers. In addition, each individual store brand derives significant value from the scale, corporate infrastructure, and centralized marketing programs associated with our large store network. These benefits include: 

• | Centralized merchandise purchasing and supply procurement programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel price optimization and purchasing functions;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Common private label offerings;
--+--------------------------------


• | Common loyalty program under the name fas REWARDS®;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Centralized environmental management and environmental practices; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Common IT and point-of-sale platforms.
--+---------------------------------------

 Retail/Wholesale Business Model Generates Stable and Diversified Cash Flow. We believe that our business model of operating both retail convenience stores and wholesale motor fuel distribution generates stable and diversified cash flows, providing us with advantages over many of our competitors. Unlike many smaller convenience store operators, we are able to take advantage of the combined fuel purchasing volumes to obtain attractive pricing and terms while reducing the variability in fuel margins. We believe that operating a wholesale business also provides strategic flexibility as we are able to convert certain lower performing company-operated sites to consignment agent and lessee-dealer trade channels. We believe that the benefits associated with our retail/wholesale strategy are significantly enhanced following the closing of the Empire Acquisition in October 2020. 
 Flexibility to Address Consumers Changing Needs. Despite our large size, we believe we are a nimble retail marketer with the ability to alter store offerings quickly in the face of changing consumer needs. Our ability to pivot is facilitated by our streamlined and efficient internal decision-making structure and process that allows for the rapid implementation of new initiatives. Our flexibility is complemented by deep relationships with a host of manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. By way of example, upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to fully stock our stores with essential items, such as hand sanitizer, wipes and face masks, ahead of many of our competitors. 
 Real-time Fuel Pricing Analysis. Our fuel pricing software enables real-time insight into street-level pricing conditions across our entire portfolio and estimates demand impacts from various pricing alternatives. This allows us to rapidly make pricing decisions intended to satisfy gallon and gross profit targets. Many of our competitors are smaller operators which lack this visibility into their fuel pricing strategies and as a result forego opportunities to optimize total fuel margin. 
 Robust Embedded Growth Opportunities, Including a Platform-Wide Store Refresh Program. Our primary growth strategy has historically been strategic acquisitions in contiguous and attractive markets. As a result of our significant scale and access to 
 5

capital, we are also focusing on a platform-wide store refresh program that we believe can generate improved returns from acquired assets. Additional embedded growth levers include improving an existing loyalty program, expanding foodservice offerings in-line with recent consumer preferences, the expansion of gaming at select locations, and the expansion of private label. 
 Experienced Management with Significant Ownership. Our management team, led by Arie Kotler, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has a strong track record of revenue growth and profitability improvement. Arie Kotler purchased control of GPM in 2011, when it directly operated and supplied fuel to 320 stores and had revenues of approximately $1.2 billion. We have a deep and talented management team across all facets of our operations and have added leaders in key positions intended to enable continued business growth.  Our management team has an average tenure with GPM and in the convenience store industry of 15 years and 22 years, respectively. Arie Kotler is our largest individual stockholder, currently owning approximately 17% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. 
 Strong Balance Sheet with Capacity to Execute Growth Strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we had significant cash on our balance sheet and capacity available under existing lines of credit. In addition, we generally finance inventory purchases on customary trade credit terms, which is aided by relatively quick inventory turnover, enabling us to manage the business without large amounts of cash and working capital. As a result of these financial resources, we believe that we will have ample financial flexibility to execute on our growth strategy. 
Growth Strategy 
 We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our sales and profitability by continuing to execute our operating strategy, growing our store base in existing and contiguous markets through acquisitions, and enhancing the performance of current stores. With our achievement of significant size and scale, we believe that our refocused organic growth strategy, including implementing company-wide marketing and merchandising initiatives, will add significant value to the assets we have acquired. We believe that this complementary strategy will help further enhance our growth and results of operations. We expect to use a portion of the cash available to us to fund our growth strategy. Specific elements of our growth strategy include the following: 
 Pursue Acquisitions in Existing and Contiguous Markets. We have completed 18 acquisitions in the last eight years, adding approximately 1,200 retail stores and approximately 1,500 dealer locations. We believe that our acquired locations combined with our scalable infrastructure represents a strong platform for future growth through acquisitions and organic growth within the highly fragmented convenience store industry. With approximately 70% of the convenience store market composed of chains with 50 or fewer locations as of 2019, we believe that there is ample opportunity to continue to consolidate. We have traditionally acquired a majority of our stores in smaller towns with less concentration of national-chain convenience stores.  Approximately 40% of all our retail stores are in cities with populations of fewer than 20,000 people.  Additionally, approximately 18% of all retail stores are in cities with populations between 20,000 and 50,000 people.  We believe that our focus on secondary and tertiary markets allows us to preserve “local” brand name recognition and align local market needs with capital investment. We have established a dedicated in-house M&A team that focuses on identifying, closing and integrating acquisitions. We have a highly actionable pipeline of potential targets, and we currently focus on existing and contiguous markets where demographics and overall market characteristics are similar to our existing markets. In addition, we believe that our unique retail/wholesale business model provides us with strategic flexibility to acquire chains with both retail and dealer locations. The acquisition of Empire’s business in October 2020 added significant scale to our wholesale fuel channel in terms of fuel gallons sold and materially increased our footprint to include 10 new states and the District of Columbia. We believe that our acquisition of Empire will also enable us to grow through the acquisition of supply contracts with independent dealers. 
 Store Remodel Opportunity. In addition to acquisitions, we believe that we have an expansive, embedded remodel opportunity within our existing store base. We have driven significant synergies from acquisitions but have yet to further optimize the performance of certain stores we have purchased. Based on traffic counts, local demographic information and internal analyses, we have identified nearly 700 stores as potential candidates for remodel, and we currently anticipate remodeling approximately 360 sites over the next three to five years. Although highly dependent on store size and format, a store remodel would typically include improvements to overall layout and flow of the store, an expanded foodservice and grab-n-go offering, updated equipment, beer caves, remodeled and upgraded restrooms, flooring and lighting, checkouts and an interior and exterior upgrade to give the store a more recognizable feel across the network (our “Family of Community Brands”) and generate a more enticing experience for the consumer. Our goal is to generate pre-tax returns on investment of at least 20% on store investments. While we will continue to prioritize acquisitions and our store remodel program, we will consider opportunistic new store builds to further accelerate growth. 
 6

Enhanced Marketing Initiatives. We plan to continue to pursue numerous in-store sales growth and margin enhancement opportunities that exist across our expansive footprint. The initiatives we are currently evaluating include, among others: 
  
• | enhanced customer relationship-focused loyalty program and associated promotional events associated with the November 2020 launch of a revised program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced store planogram and product mix optimization with customer centric data-driven placement of top-selling SKUs across all categorizes with select regional customization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of delivery in approximately 600 stores;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of freezers in approximately 650 stores and grab-n-go coolers in approximately 525 stores; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of our high margin private label offering in the stores.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Foodservice Opportunity. Our current foodservice offering primarily consists of hot and fresh foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. We offer a value food menu consisting of items such as hot dogs and chicken sandwiches.  We have historically relied upon a limited number of franchised quick service restaurants and in-store delis to drive customer traffic rather than other foodservice offerings. As a result, we believe that our under-penetration of foodservice presents an opportunity to expand foodservice offerings and margin in response to changing consumer behavior. In addition, we believe that continued investment in new technology platforms and applications to adapt to evolving consumer eating preferences, including contactless checkout, order ahead service, and delivery will further drive growth in profitability. 
 Store Portfolio Optimization. We continually review any underperforming retail sites for opportunities to improve store performance, switch to dealer channels, or to sell these sites outright. If we do not believe that investments in store offerings or appearances are likely to provide adequate returns on capital, retail sites can be converted to either lessee-dealer or consignment agent sites. After conversion, we receive rent from the tenant and typically enter into a long-term supply contract with the dealer, eliminating exposure to retail operations and store-level operating expenses. Alternatively, sites with higher and better alternative use potential may be sold. 
Suppliers
 We leverage both our relationships with major consumer packaged goods supplier partners and distributors such as Core-Mark and Grocery Supply Company, as well as more than 700 direct store delivery supplier distributors. 
 We purchase motor fuel primarily from large, integrated oil companies and independent refiners under supply agreements. In addition, we purchase unbranded fuel from branded and unbranded fuel suppliers to supply 151 unbranded fueling locations. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 88% of our retail fuel locations sold branded fuel. We sell branded fuel under the Valero®, Marathon®, BP® and Shell® brand names, plus several other brands. We are the largest distributor of Valero branded motor fuel on the U.S. East Coast and the third largest distributor of Valero branded motor fuel in the United States. In addition to driving customer traffic, we believe that our branded fuel strategy enables us to maintain a secure fuel supply. 
Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive retail convenience market, which includes businesses with operations and services that are similar to ours, primarily the sale of convenience items and motor fuels. We face significant competition from other large chain operators, such as: 7-Eleven; Circle K; Casey’s; Murphy USA; Quik Trip; Royal Farms; Sheetz; Speedway; and Wawa. In particular, large convenience store chains have expanded their numbers of locations and remodeled their existing locations in recent years, enhancing their competitive position. We believe that convenience stores managed by individual operators that offer branded or non-branded fuel are also significant competitors in the market. Often, operators of both chains and individual stores compete by selling unbranded fuel at lower retail prices relative to the market. We believe that the primary competitive factors influencing the retail segment are: site location; competitive prices; convenient access routes; the quality and configuration of the store and the fueling facility; the range of high-quality products and services offered; a convenient store-front; cleanliness; branded fuel; and the degree of capital investment in the store. 
 The convenience store industry is also experiencing competition from other retail sectors, including grocery stores, large warehouse retail stores, dollar stores and pharmacies. In particular, dollar stores (such as Family Dollar and Dollar General) and pharmacies (such as CVS and Walgreens) have expanded their product offerings to sell snacks, beer and wine and other products that have traditionally been sold by convenience stores, while grocery and large warehouse stores (such as Costco and Wal-Mart) have expanded their fuel offering adjacent to their stores. 
 7

We believe that the primary barriers to entry in this industry are the significant financial strength required to enter into agreements with suppliers of fuel products and competition from other fuel companies and retail chains. 
 The wholesale business is also competitive. Our wholesale segment competes with refiners that distribute their own products, as well as other independent third-party motor fuel distributors. Wholesale fuel distributors typically compete by offering shorter contract commitments, lesser collateral requirements and larger incentives to enter into contracts. We distribute fuel sourced from a number of major oil company suppliers which allows us to approach a wide variety of outside branded and unbranded dealers in order offer a variety of alternative supply arrangements. 
 In the wholesale segment, we supply fuel to third parties both at sites controlled by the third party and at sites controlled by us, either through ownership of the site or a long-term lease. In order to mitigate this competition, we typically offer the outside operators competitive pricing within the framework of our existing fuel supply agreements, such as those we have with Valero, BP, Shell, Marathon and ExxonMobil. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to numerous legal and regulatory restrictions and requirements at the federal, state and local levels. With regard to fuel, these restrictions and requirements relate primarily to the transportation, storage and sale of petroleum products, including stringent environmental protection requirements.  In our wholesale and GPMP segments, we are also subject to the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (“PMPA”), which is a federal law that applies to the relationships between fuel suppliers and wholesale distributors, as well as between wholesale distributors and dealers, regarding the marketing of branded fuel. The law is intended to prevent the arbitrary or discriminatory cancellation, or non-renewal, of dealership agreements and stipulates limitations on the cancellation, or non-renewal, of agreements for distribution of branded fuel, unless certain conditions are satisfied. 
 With regard to non-fuel products, there are legal restrictions at the federal, state and local levels in connection with the sale of food, alcohol, cigarettes and other tobacco products, menu labeling, money orders, money transfer services, gaming, lottery, adult magazines and ephedrine. Also, regulatory supervision is exercised by health departments at the federal, state and local levels over the food products that are sold in our stores. With respect to data held by us, including credit card information and data related to loyalty customers, we are subject to federal, state and local requirements related to the possession, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including mandated procedures to be followed in the event a data breach were to occur. 
 We hold various federal, state, and local licenses and permits, some of which are perpetual, but most of which must be renewed annually. These include general business licenses, lottery licenses, licenses and permits in connection with the sale of cigarettes, licenses in connection with the operation of gaming machines, licenses in connection with the sale of alcoholic drinks, licenses and permits that are required in connection with the sale of fuel, licenses that are required for the operation of convenience stores and licenses to sell food products. 
 EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, is a global standard for credit cards that use computer chips to authenticate and secure chip-card transactions. The liability for fraudulent credit card transactions shifted from the credit card processor to us in October 2015 for transactions processed inside the convenience stores (although due to the unavailability of the correct software from branded fuel suppliers, certain of such suppliers have retained specified associated liabilities) and will shift to us in April 2021 for transactions at the fuel dispensers. We have upgraded all of our inside point-of-sale machines to be EMV-compliant, and, in connection with incentive funds provided by fuel suppliers, we are actively upgrading our fuel dispensers to be EMV-compliant at the fuel dispenser with approximately 30% of retail locations completed as of December 31, 2020.  Both due to the unavailability of the correct software from branded fuel suppliers and the required time and cost necessary to upgrade each site, we do not expect to upgrade all of our sites prior to April 2021, but anticipate being substantially complete by the end of 2022.  Accordingly, we may be subject to liability for fraudulent credit card transactions processed at fuel dispensers. We do not believe that this will expose us to material liability. 
 Our operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage, overtime, working conditions and employment eligibility requirements. Recently, proposals have emerged at local, state and federal levels to increase minimum wage rates. 
 We are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations that address our properties and operations, including, without limitation the transportation, storage and sale of fuel, which have a considerable impact on our operations, including compliance with the requirements and regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and comparable state counterparts. We are required to comply with the following regulations, among others: 
  
• | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and comparable state and local laws, which imposes strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, liability, without regard to

fault, on the owner and operator as well as former owners and operators of properties where a hazardous substance has been released into the environment, including liabilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of contamination and any related damages to natural resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) gives EPA the authority to control hazardous waste from the “cradle-to-grave.” This includes the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA also address environmental problems that could result from underground tanks storing fuel and other hazardous substances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local laws which imposes requirements on emissions to the air from motor fueling activities in certain areas of the country, including those that do not meet state or national ambient air quality standards. These laws may require the installation of vapor recovery systems to control emissions of volatile organic compounds to the air during the motor fueling process. Under the CAA and comparable state and local laws, permits are typically required to emit regulated air pollutants into the atmosphere.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) provides protection for the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standards require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

 The EPA, and several states, have established regulations concerning the ownership and operation of underground fuel storage tanks (“UST”), the release of hazardous substances into the air, water and land, the storage, handling disposal and transportation of hazardous materials, restrictions on exposure to hazardous substances and maintaining safety and health of employees who handle or are exposed to such substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations regarding fuel quality and air emissions. 
 We are committed to compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We allocate a portion of our capital expenditure program to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and such capital expenditures were approximately $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and we anticipate expenditures of approximately $3 million for the year ending December 31, 2021. Our environmental department maintains direct interaction with federal, state and local environmental agencies for each state in which we operate. As part of our environmental risk management process, we engage environmental consultants and service providers to assist in analyzing our exposure to environmental risks by developing remediation plans, providing other environmental services, and taking corrective actions as necessary.  
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 10,380 employees, with 9,394 employed in our stores and 986 in corporate and field management positions. As of December 31, 2020, none of our employees were represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages. We value our employees and believe that employee development and training are key elements of our effective performance. 
 We dedicate significant resources to the training and development of our store employees. We offer training based on our employees’ specific job requirements and employee levels through the use of training modules and on-the-job training conducted by store managers or regional trainers. Trainings vary based on employee level, but generally focus on topics such as customer service, safety, environmental issues and regulations, as well as our operations and policies. We have developed training centers for new employees at our regional offices. When acquiring new sites, the training of new store managers is conducted by our experienced store managers. We have also developed designated training programs for Store Manager Trainees, Assistant Managers, Maintenance Technicians and Food Service Managers. We have developed, and continue to refine, additional training programs for store and district managers, focusing on leadership and other “soft skills.” 
 The annual turnover rate of our store employees was approximately 120% in 2020. We believe factors that partially influence our employee turnover are the prevailing wage rates in the markets in which we operate and the demanding nature of our employee’s jobs. We seek to promote employee retention by providing attractive employee benefits and by granting retention and other bonus opportunities to our employees based on their respective roles. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We use a variety of measures, such as trademarks and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures as a key part of our broader risk management strategy.
