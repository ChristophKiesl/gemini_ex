Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. (referred to herein as “the Company,” “Evoqua,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated on October 7, 2013. On January 15, 2014, Evoqua acquired the Water Technologies business unit formerly owned by Siemens AG (“Siemens”). On November 6, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”), and our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on November 2, 2017 under the ticker symbol “AQUA.”
We are a leading provider of mission-critical water and wastewater treatment solutions, offering a broad portfolio of products, services, and expertise to support customers across various end markets. We are headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with locations across ten countries. We have a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technologies offered under market‑leading and well‑established brands. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals. We have worked to protect water, the environment, and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs.
We provide solutions across the entire water cycle. The water cycle begins with influent water, which is sourced from rivers, lakes, and other sources. We treat influent water for use in a wide variety of industrial, commercial, and municipal applications, including use as process water in manufacturing, power generation and other industrial applications, use as ingredient water in the production of food, beverage, and other goods, use in laboratory testing, use by commercial aquatic facilities, and to produce safe drinking water. After the water is used it is considered effluent water, and we treat it to remove impurities so that it can be discharged safely back into the environment or reused for industrial, commercial, or municipal applications.
We target attractive global end markets that utilize and treat water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including general manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, municipal drinking water and wastewater, aquatics, refining and marine end markets. While a decline in general global and economic conditions could adversely affect us, our business is highly diversified across these key end markets, and we believe that no single end market drives the overall results of our business.
Our Business Segments
Our business is organized into two segments: a customer-facing service organization called Integrated Solutions and Services (“ISS”) and a product technology group called Applied Product Technologies (“APT”) focused on sales primarily through indirect channels.
Our ISS segment provides application-specific solutions and full lifecycle services for critical water and wastewater applications across numerous end markets. Our APT segment provides highly differentiated and scalable water and wastewater products and technologies as stand-alone offerings or components in integrated solutions. The chart below reflects revenue by segment for the year ended September 30, 2021:

Customers
Our customers span a diverse range of end markets, including general manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, municipal drinking water and wastewater, aquatics, refining and marine end markets. We sell directly to end users in these end markets and also to intermediaries, such as OEMs, system integrators, regional distributors, and engineering firms. Our business is not dependent on any single customer or end market. During the year ended September 30, 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 1.3% of our revenue, and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 7.4% of our revenue.
We provide products, services, and solutions to federal, state and local government customers both directly and indirectly as a supplier to general contractors. Many of our government contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless of whether we are the prime contractor or a subcontractor. Upon a termination for convenience, we are generally able to recover the purchase price for delivered items and reimbursement of allowable work in process costs.
Suppliers
We maintain a cost-effective and diversified procurement program focused on supply chain continuity and customer fulfillment, utilizing strong relationships with strategic suppliers across key commodities. The top materials in our supply chain include chemicals, membranes, resin, metal fabrications, carbon, and electrical components. Procurement strategy within the project environment is focused on ensuring our ability to meet individual customer needs, with particular focus on more complex installation projects. We seek to in-source products that align with our existing manufacturing core competencies and that enable us to provide our customers with the highest level of value. Our diversified supply base spans across multiple suppliers and geographies, which we believe enables us to be cost-effective and responsive while also embracing our sustainability objectives.
Seasonality
Our business may exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers’ increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, we experience increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, winter storms, droughts, and floods, can also have varying impacts on our business. Certain events may cause customer shutdowns that prevent or defer our performance of services or sale of equipment, while other events may drive increased demand for our products and services, particularly emergency response services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.
Sales and Marketing
Our ISS segment markets its offerings through a direct sales and service team, which is organized geographically and by end market and is complemented by an inside sales force, field sales engineers and a growing e-commerce platform. Our key end markets served by our ISS segment are general manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, biotech, power, microelectronics, chemical processing, food and beverage, and refining. As of September 30, 2021, our ISS segment included approximately 350 employees in sales and marketing roles and a services network of approximately 950 employees in field service and application engineering roles. 
Our APT segment markets its offerings primarily through indirect channels to serve the global market or through our ISS segment’s sales organization as part of broader solutions. APT maintains relationships with OEMs, system integrators, sales representatives, regional distributors, engineering firms, and various other end users through our direct technical sales force to drive adoption of our offerings. APT maintains a comprehensive municipal representative network in the U.S., providing us with an opportunity to influence specifications and the basis of design for new treatment facilities. As of September 30, 2021, we had active relationships with more than 240 distributors and sales representatives.
Growth Opportunities
We believe the global water market is well positioned to grow, supported by a variety of anticipated secular trends that will drive demand for clean water across a multitude of industrial, commercial, and municipal applications. These secular trends include water and climate risk, health and safety, connectivity and overall economic growth. Less predictable water availability and increased water scarcity are among the anticipated effects of climate change. Accessing water from current sources is becoming increasingly challenging, so the development of non-traditional sources of water and recycle and reuse technologies will be required. 
The supply of clean water could be further impacted by factors including aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. As global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, we expect demand for solutions and services will continue to increase. Additionally, a decrease in the supply of clean water, as well as a heightened focus on environmental sustainability across various end markets, may increase the demand for closed-loop solutions that allow recycling and reuse of effluent water for certain applications. In order to position the company to meet this demand, key elements of our growth strategy include:
Provide a higher value-add service-based business model to our customers. Many of our customers require water that meets a particular specification to facilitate the operation of their own businesses. Our goal is to provide reliable water treatment solutions by combining our products and technologies with our extensive service and distribution capabilities, enabling our customers to outsource their water treatment needs to us and focus on their core businesses. Our outsourced water offerings are high value add solutions utilizing our owned assets to generate service revenue. An example is our Water One® service platform, which uses digitally connected remote monitoring technology to provide customers with predictive and proactive service, usage-based pricing, and simplified billing. 
Drive margin expansion and cash flow improvements through continued focus on strategic pricing, operational excellence, execution and cost savings initiatives.  During the year ended September 30, 2021, we deployed a more robust strategic pricing program to focus on efficient and effective price increase implementation with the objective of ensuring more immediate recovery of increased supply chain costs and capturing appropriate value for our innovations. Dedicated resources and systems have been put in place to institutionalize these practices. In parallel, we are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our continuing supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, capturing benefits of our Water One® service platform and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization and our sales, inventory and operations planning, including footprint rationalization. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have the capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increases in fixed costs.
Continue to expand our capabilities for the treatment of increasingly complex emerging contaminants. Emerging contaminants such as PFAS, PFOA, selenium, micro-plastics and many others, may present global health risks if not properly removed from drinking water, process water and wastewater. We believe we have one of the leading portfolios of water treatment products and solutions to remove emerging contaminants from water including granular activated carbon, ion exchange resin, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation processes. In addition, we have an extensive service branch network, located predominantly in the United States, as well as a large fleet of mobile assets to respond quickly to customers’ water treatment needs.
Continue to evaluate and pursue accretive acquisitions to add new technologies, attractive geographic regions and end markets. As a complement to our organic growth initiatives, we view acquisitions as a key element of our overall growth strategy. We target acquisitions that we believe will enable us to accelerate our growth in our current addressable market, new geographies, and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has helped us expand our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhance our portfolio of technologies.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we completed the following acquisitions:
•On December 17, 2020, we acquired the industrial water business of Ultrapure & Industrial Services, LLC (“Ultrapure”) for $8.7 million cash paid at closing. On April 1, 2021, we paid an additional $0.3 million as a result of net working capital adjustments. Ultrapure, based out of Texas, provides customers across multiple end markets with a variety of water treatment products and services, including service deionization, reverse osmosis, UV, and ozonation. Ultrapure will strengthen our service capabilities in the Houston and Dallas markets and is a part of our ISS segment. 
•On April 1, 2021, we acquired the assets of Water Consulting Specialists, Inc (“WCSI”) for $12.0 million cash paid at closing. WCSI is a leader in the design, manufacturing, and service of industrial high-purity water treatment systems. The acquisition strengthens our portfolio of high-purity water treatment systems and provides the opportunity to further expand its digitally enabled solutions and services in key industrial markets. WCSI is a part of our ISS segment. 
Research, Development and Engineering
We utilize a disciplined, stage-gate process consisting of development, field test, commercialization, supply chain and sourcing decisions to identify and develop new technologies for commercialization. We also partner with leading universities, research centers and other outside agencies to explore potential developments.
As of September 30, 2021, our global research, development, and engineering footprint included seven facilities located in the U.S., the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and India, staffed with managers, scientists, researchers, engineers, and technicians. In October 2021, we opened a new Sustainability and Innovation Hub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This 18,000 square-foot facility houses a hands-on demonstration and training area, a pilot testing environment, and a laboratory to grow our analytical and feasibility study capacity. We expect this facility to advance our research and development capabilities and enable further development of sustainable water treatment technologies. Our total expected investment in this facility is approximately $5.6 million, of which $3.5 million has been recognized as of September 30, 2021. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business, but we do not believe our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As of September 30, 2021, we have approximately 1,600 granted or pending patents (after giving effect to patents transferred as a result of acquisitions and dispositions to date). We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by pursuing patent protection, obtaining copyrights and registering our trademarks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We currently rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and control access to our intellectual property through license agreements, confidentiality procedures, nondisclosure agreements with third parties, employment agreements and other contractual rights, to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
Our industry is highly fragmented and includes a number of regional and niche offering focused competitors. Competition is largely based on product performance and reliability, pricing of products and services, ability to provide service and support, application expertise and process knowledge, brand reputation, energy and water efficiency, product compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements, product lifecycle cost, scalability, timeliness of delivery, the proximity of service centers to customers and the effectiveness of distribution channels. Within each of our segments and the various businesses that comprise them, we compete with a variety of companies, but we do not consider any single company to be a key competitor to our business as a whole.
Backlog
Backlog represents the expected future revenue for unfulfilled and remaining performance obligations for capital projects where neither Evoqua nor the customer can terminate the contract without penalty. As of September 30, 2021, our backlog was approximately $275.6 million.
Human Capital Resources
We believe our talent within the organization is key to our long-term success. Our human capital management philosophy and objectives focus on creating a high-performance culture in which employees are highly enabled, empowered, and accountable to deliver results. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 4,000 employees. Of these employees, approximately 59% were full-time salaried staff and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full-time and part-time hourly workers. Approximately 75% of our employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 25% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities in the U.S. or Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Germany and the Netherlands, our employee populations there are represented by works councils.
The health, safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority. Fostering a safe working environment is critical to our ability to attract and retain talent and to earn and keep the trust of our customers. In order to do so, our Environmental, Health and Safety team conducts monthly safety reviews at the executive level, reviews each recordable accident with our CEO and leadership team, conducts quarterly reviews with our Board of Directors, routinely reviews key performance indicators, and conducts regular facility audits. Every employee is empowered to stop work when they have a concern or see the potential for injury. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on protecting the health, safety and well-being of our employees and managing the business to preserve our workforce. We have implemented safety plans and protocols following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization, and other federal, state, local and international regulations, and we continue to evolve our corporate and site-specific crisis management teams to actively manage and ensure compliance with these plans and protocols. 
We are currently operating in an extremely challenging talent market. Market hiring surges, increased attrition and shifting work expectations have significantly impacted the attraction and retention of talent, creating a hyper-competitive global marketplace. We understand that our long-term success will require a differentiated, targeted approach to talent attraction and retention. In response to these challenges, we took a number of actions in 2021 in an effort to enhance our ability to attract and retain diverse talent. 
•We learned through employee surveys, stay interviews, and exit survey data that career development and recognition were two key factors that might influence our employees to consider leaving the organization. In response, we developed six enterprise-wide career paths designed to help employees in certain roles establish career development plans. We also put in place processes to advance our internal talent placements, ensuring cross-segment and cross-functional internal talent moves are occurring across the organization, to help employees achieve the objectives of their development plans.  We plan to launch a global recognition program in 2022 to ensure the accomplishments of our employees are better acknowledged.
•We recently launched workstreams in two key focus areas: total compensation, with a deeper focus on sign-on and referral bonuses, and branding and advertising within the talent market, with a heightened focus on Inclusion and Diversity and Sustainability.
•We launched our flexible work approach that balances the benefits of working remotely with the experience of working on-site. 
Our Inclusion & Diversity (ID) strategy is also critical to our long-term success, and we continuously strive to improve the diversity of our workforce through inclusive practices and actions.  Through our ID action plan, we launched a Business Resource Group called the Evoqua Inclusion Network (EIN) in September 2021, which is tasked with identifying action opportunities that promote inclusion and minimize unconscious bias. Specific actions taken to date include the dissemination to all global employees of an unconscious bias learning program, enhancement of our benefits offerings with our flexible work approach, updating our internal and external branding materials focusing on ID, and implementing recruiting strategies to better attract diversity, such as blind resumes and diverse interview panels. 
We are working to improve gender diversity at all levels of the business through our ID strategy and action plan. As of September 30, 2021, women make up approximately 20% of our global employee population and approximately 15% of our leadership roles, defined as director level and above.  In 2021, we saw an increase of approximately 23% in gender diversity in leadership roles within the organization, and we have seen an increase of approximately 95% in gender diversity in leadership roles from September 30, 2018 to September 30, 2021.
We embrace inclusion and diversity not only in our employment practices but also in our director selection. Since October 2018, our Corporate Governance Guidelines have provided that diverse candidates, including women and minorities, must be included in each pool of candidates from which we select new directors, otherwise known as the “Rooney Rule.” Forty percent of our current Board members self-identify as diverse, in terms of race, ethnicity or gender, including three of the four directors that have joined our Board since our initial public offering. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive and varied laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to anti‑corruption and trade, anti-money laundering, import and export compliance, antitrust, data security and privacy, employment, workplace safety, product safety, public health and safety, environmental compliance, intellectual property, transportation, zoning, and fire codes. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we operate our business in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject our operations and products to extensive environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and permits, domestically and internationally, at national, state, and local levels throughout the world. Such laws, regulations and permits relate to, among other things, air emissions, potable and non-potable water and wastewater treatment, wastewater discharge, the generation, handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes, product safety and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute, and they could increase our cost of producing certain products or make certain products obsolete or less attractive in the marketplace. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, damage to property or natural resources, personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders 
requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment, remedial actions or the pulling of products from the market, and could negatively impact our reputation with customers.
Many of the customers that we serve are subject to the same or similar environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws by our customers could result in increased or decreased demand for our products and services.
Specific laws and regulations that may affect our operations or demand for our products and services include, among others, the following.
•The federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters. These laws may limit the quantity of pollutants in water discharges and require persons to apply for and obtain permits and conduct sampling and monitoring, and in some cases, treat the water. Changes in limits on the quantity of pollutants and the types of pollutants under the CWA and comparable state, local or foreign laws could affect demand for our products or services or create liability for us as the result of contamination in water we treat.
•The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that set standards for drinking water quality and protect sources of public drinking water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has issued standards for microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, and radionuclides. Changes in the SDWA or comparable state, local or foreign standards, including the addition of newly-regulated contaminants, could affect demand for our products and services and/or result in the obsolescence of our products or lead to an interruption or suspension of our operations. Additionally, increased public awareness of the presence and human health impacts of manmade chemicals and naturally occurring contaminants in drinking water may increase demand for our municipal service offerings. Correspondingly, if stringent laws or regulations are delayed or are not enacted, or repealed or amended to be less stringent, or enacted with prolonged phase‑in periods, or not enforced, then demand for our products and services may also be reduced.
•The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate substances designated as hazardous waste. Our operations involve the generation, handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes. Changes in materials covered or treatment, storage, and disposal requirements under RCRA and comparable state, local or foreign standards could result in increased operating costs or require additional investment in our covered facilities. 
•The Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state, local and foreign laws. The Company has been subject to claims under CERCLA, which can impose joint and several liability on “potentially responsible parties” for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of specified substances, including, under CERCLA, those designated as “hazardous substances.”
•The Toxic Substances Control Act (the “TSCA”), the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (the “FIFRA”), and comparable state, local and foreign laws that regulate the manufacture and/or distribution of certain chemical substances and/or disinfection equipment. These laws may require ongoing submissions to the EPA or state environmental agencies, including, but not limited to, information on the chemistry and toxicology of the chemical substance or products, registrations, notification, and other requirements before such products can be manufactured, distributed, or sold. Changes in these laws could affect demand for our products and services, increase our cost of operations, result in the obsolescence of our products or lead to an interruption or suspension of our operations.
We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
