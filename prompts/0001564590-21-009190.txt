Item 1. Business
 Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries is a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States, or “U.S.,” Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. 
 We are a leader and one of the most geographically diverse operators in the motion picture exhibition industry. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 531 theatres and 5,958 screens in the U.S. and Latin America. Our U.S. circuit had 331 theatres and 4,507 screens in 42 states and our international circuit had 200 theatres and 1,451 screens in 15 countries.  Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios and other content providers. We believe our portfolio of modern, high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and has contributed to our historically consistent financial performance.  
 As of December 31, 2020, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments: U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the world and our industry. As a movie exhibitor that operates spaces where patrons gather in close proximity, we have been, and continue to be, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, to comply with government mandates, we temporarily closed all of our theatres in the U.S. and Latin America effective March 17, 2020 and March 18, 2020, respectively. In conjunction with the temporary closure of our theatres in March 2020, we implemented temporary personnel and salary reductions, limited non-essential operating and capital expenditures, and negotiated modified timing and/or abatement of contractual payments with landlords and other major suppliers until our theatres reopened.  In addition, we suspended our quarterly dividend.
As of December 31, 2020, we had reopened 217 of our domestic theatres and 129 of our international theatres, showing a limited volume of new releases along with library content during reduced operating hours with limited capacities.  
 Some of the health and safety protocols that we have implemented in our theatres for the safety of our employees, guests and surrounding communities include:
  
• | staggering showtimes and limiting capacities to maximize physical distancing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | instituting seat buffering technology to ensure social distancing within the auditorium;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring face masks for all guests within the theater, which may only be removed for eating and drinking in the auditoriums;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implementing stringent disinfecting and sanitizing protocols and providing ample supplies of hand sanitizer and seat wipes for patrons;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delivering an abundant supply of fresh outdoor air, maintaining optimal air circulation and eliminating potential pollutants through filtration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | encouraging contactless transactions; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | requiring that employees receive special training, participate in wellness check-ins and use personal protective wear, including face masks and gloves.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While some staffing has been brought back to support theatre reopenings, we continue operating with reduced staffing and limiting capital expenditures to essential activities and projects.  Government restrictions also continue to fluctuate with the status of the virus, impacting our reopening plans.  We continue to work with landlords and other vendors on modified contractual payment terms while we continue to navigate through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and seek to recover a routine level of operations
 2

Our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage allowed us to enter the global COVID-19 pandemic in a solid financial position. Based on our current estimates of recovery, we believe we have and will generate sufficient cash to sustain operations. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, access to credit markets and ability to service existing and future indebtedness, some of which are significant.
 Motion Picture Exhibition Industry Overview
 Domestic
 North American industry results for 2020 are not yet available, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting temporary theatre closures, are expected to be significantly lower than prior years.  Preliminary estimates indicate that box office revenues were approximately $2.2 billion for 2020, down approximately 81% as compared to 2019.
 The following table represents the results of a survey by Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, published during March 2020, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the five-year period from 2015 through 2019.
 
 
 | U.S. Box | | | | | | 
-----+-----------------+------+---------------+------+----------------+---+-----
 | Office Revenues | | Attendance | | Average Ticket
Year | ($ in billions) | | (in billions) | | Price 
2015 | $ | 11.1 | | 1.32 | | $ | 8.43
2016 | $ | 11.4 | | 1.32 | | $ | 8.65
2017 | $ | 11.1 | | 1.24 | | $ | 8.97
2018 | $ | 11.9 | | 1.30 | | $ | 9.11
2019 | $ | 11.4 | | 1.24 | | $ | 9.16

 While the industry experienced drastically reduced results during 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, industry statistics show slight increases and decreases in attendance over the past five years. Historically, domestic box office revenues remained relatively stable during this period.  Even during recessionary periods, industry results demonstrated stability and a continued ability to attract consumers.   Box office performance has been primarily dependent on the quality, quantity and timing of film product.  Average ticket prices can also be driven by the mix of film product and availability of films in premium formats.
 Films released during the year ended December 31, 2020 included Bad Boys for Life, Sonic the Hedgehog, Birds of Prey, Dolittle, The Invisible Man and The Call of the Wild.   The carryover of late 2019 releases such as 1917, Jumanji:  The Next Level and Star Wars:  The Rise of Skywalker also contributed to industry box office during early 2020.  Due to the temporary closure of many theatres beginning in March, movie studios delayed the release of many films originally planned for 2020.  As we reopened our domestic theatres, we offered patrons primarily library content, bringing back many classics to the big screen.  As more theatres reopened and enhanced health and safety protocols were implemented, studios began releasing new content, which included Wonder Woman 1984, Tenet, The Croods: A New Age, The New Mutants, Unhinged, The War with Grandpa and Honest Thief.
Currently, films scheduled for release in 2021 include the sequel to Marvel’s Spider-man Far From Home, Top Gun Maverick, Black Widow, F9, Luca, Eternals, Mission: Impossible 7, No Time to Die, Cruella, and Minions:  The Rise of Gru, among others.  As the industry navigates the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the various regulations and restrictions, film release schedules may continue to fluctuate. 
  International 
 According to MPAA, international box office revenues were approximately $30.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  More specifically, Latin American box office revenues were $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  As noted above, industry performance for 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and results are not yet available.  Preliminary estimates for Latin American box office revenues for 2020 is $0.3 billion, down approximately 89% compared to 2019.

In addition to the quality, quantity and timing of Hollywood product, performance in Latin American markets is also impacted by social behaviors, growing populations, and continued retail development. In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also contribute to box office growth.  However, local restrictions and regulations implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted movie production and movie-going during 2020 similar to the U.S.  
 Drivers of Continued Industry Success
 Industry dynamics continue to evolve as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we believe the following factors will continue to drive the strength of our industry:
 Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands. Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new major motion picture releases. In addition to representing a significant share of a film’s overall revenues, a successful theatrical release “brands” a film and is one of the major contributors to a film’s success in “downstream” markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, DVDs, pay television, network and syndicated television, and streaming video on demand, as well as theme parks and branded retail merchandise.  While some film releases for 2020 did not have, and certain films for 2021 are not expected to have, a normal exclusive theatrical release window due to theatre closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, theatrical exhibition is expected to continue to contribute a significant portion of overall revenues generated by a film.
 Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment.  Post COVID-19 pandemic, as venues continue to reopen and restrictions are lifted, we expect consumption of media and out-of-home experiential offerings to continue to increase due to pent up demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Movie going remains one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment.  While the average movie ticket price in the U.S. was $9.16 for 2019, average prices for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $32.99 to $102.35 per ticket according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2020 industry data was not yet available.)
 Expansion of Concepts and Product Offerings that Enhance the Movie-Going Experience.  Over recent years, the motion picture exhibition industry has invested in the development of new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences as well as to differentiate the movie-going experience from other in-home and out-of-home entertainment options. Some examples include changing the overall style, and amenities of theatres, as well as expansion of concession product offerings that provide more variety to traditional popcorn, fountain drinks and candy.   Enhanced projection and sound equipment and motion seats are offered in some locations to further enhance the movie viewing experience. New and enhanced programming alternatives expand the industry’s entertainment offerings to attract a broader customer base.   As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered new options to our guests, including Private Watch Parties to allow them to see a movie of their choice with a group of their choice as well as seat buffering technology to facilitate social distancing while enjoying out-of-home entertainment.  We offered many classic and holiday movies in the absence of new film releases.  To encourage contactless transactions in our theatres, while further enhancing the movie-going experience, we developed mobile concession ordering and delivery-to-seat options in some locations.  
 Contribution of International Markets to Box Office Performance. International markets continue to be an important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $30.8 billion, or approximately 73%, of 2019 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2020 industry data was not yet available.) Theatres in international markets are continuing to reopen as local restrictions are revised.  Film release schedules are expected to follow those of the U.S. consistent with previous years.  We believe the contribution of markets outside North America to the global box office revenues will continue to be meaningful.
 Our Strategy
 Our primary objective for the past few years has been to attract and expand audiences to maximize attendance and box office, and then pursue monetization opportunities to capture ancillary revenue.  We focused on providing an extraordinary guest experience, investing in our core circuit and continuing to grow organically to accomplish 
 4

these goals. While our long-term strategies remain consistent, for the near term we have shifted our focus to cash preservation and liquidity, closely managing costs and restructuring our operations and teams to be more efficient, and keeping our guests and employees safe and healthy.  We expect this focus to continue until we fully recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 Upon recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resurgence of the industry, our long-term strategies will again become front and center.  These include:
 Provide an Extraordinary Guest Experience. We differentiate our theatres by focusing on various initiatives that continuously enhance the in-theatre guest experience. We have a market-adaptive approach with our theatre amenities, including Luxury Lounger recliner seats, our exhibitor-branded premium large format, XD, and expanded food and beverage offerings. Our investment in these preferred amenities allows us to create and maintain a high-quality theatrical experience throughout our circuit. We believe our ongoing focus on providing an extraordinary in-theatre guest experience is a primary factor of our consistent industry-leading results. While our capital investments may be reduced temporarily, we will continue to ensure that our locations are well maintained.
 Enhance Overall Guest Engagement.  We offer loyalty and subscription programs that help provide a personalized experience, continued investment in our website and mobile app features and tailored custom interactions. We pursue a wide range of strategic marketing initiatives to communicate and build consumer awareness, better understand the unique preferences of our guests and enrich their movie-going experience.Pursue Organic and Synergistic Growth Opportunities and Maintain Core Circuit.  We have consistently reinvested our cash flows from operations in our circuit with a focus on new and exciting ways to attract guests.  Our commitment to investing in our theatre assets is demonstrated by our level of capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 of approximately $380.9 million, $346.1 million, and $303.6 million, respectively. In addition to our Luxury Lounger recliner seats and premium large format XD auditoriums, we have incorporated other market-adaptive concepts such as full bars and dine-in options. We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we built eleven new theatres with 97 screens and acquired two theatres with 30 screens. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also grew organically and built eleven new theatres with 97 screens and acquired two theatres with 30 screens.   As a result of a significant reduction in our operating cash flows for 2020, we halted nonessential capital expenditures and reduced our capital expenditures to $83.9 million for the year.  We built four theatres with 44 screens during 2020, as these projects were underway at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.   For the short term, we will continue to focus our capital investments on essential projects and maintaining the high quality of our assets, while we refortify our balance sheet.
Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following strengths have allowed us to compete effectively in the past and continue to help us navigate through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic:
 Disciplined Operating Philosophy. Our balanced and disciplined investment approach centers on building new theatres, thoughtfully reinvesting in our existing theatres and acquiring theatres that will complement our circuit and offer a meaningful return.   Our operating philosophy focuses on creating an extraordinary guest experience, maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes.  
 We have long believed in the combination of a strong balance sheet and ensuring our capital investments earn a solid return.  This philosophy has proved to be successful for us, and helped us enter the COVID-19 pandemic in a strong financial position. We will continue to be disciplined with our cash management and liquidity strategies as we recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring we effectively service our debt and other obligations.
 Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets.  Based on our performance in recent years, we have a leading market share in most of the U.S. markets we serve, which includes a presence in 42 states. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 20 out of our top 25 U.S. markets, including 
 5

the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Cleveland, Austin and Las Vegas.  During 2020, we continued our leadership position as we were one of the first circuits to start to reopen our theatres and we have remained open as local regulations allow.  As of December 31, 2020, we had 217 theatres reopened in the U.S.
 Located in Top Latin American Markets. We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in Latin America, with theatres in 15 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in South America.  We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina and have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile. Our geographic diversity makes us an important global distribution channel for the movie studios.  While our performance during 2020 was impacted by the temporary closure of our theatres, we continue to reopen theatres in the region with 129 open as of December 31, 2020.  
 State-of-the-Art Theatre Circuit. We offer a state-of-the-art movie-going experience, which we believe makes our theatres preferred destinations for moviegoers in our markets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we built eleven new theatres with 97 screens.   Our capital investments were very limited during 2020 due the COVID-19 pandemic, but we built four theatres with 44 new screens.  As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments to open 195 new screens over the next three years. We have also started to convert our theatres to laser projectors, further enhancing the movie-going experiences.  We expect the conversion to be completed over the next ten years.  
 We have incorporated Luxury Lounger recliner seats in all of our recent domestic new builds and have also repositioned many of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature. We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 2,815 domestic auditoriums, representing almost 63% of our domestic circuit. 
 We offer our guests a premium large format experience through our 16 IMAX screens and our 278 XD auditoriums, which represents the largest exhibitor-branded premium large format footprint in the industry. Our XD auditoriums offer a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including a Barco Auro 11.1 or Dolby Atmos sound system in select locations. The XD experience includes wall-to-wall screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience. The benefits of our XD auditoriums include program flexibility, as we can show the content of our choice, and there is no additional revenue share component outside of routine film rental. 
 We offer enhanced food and beverages such as gourmet pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches, and a selection of beers, wines, and cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums, at approximately 60% of our worldwide theatres. We also offer market-adaptive concepts with full bars or dine-in areas in certain of our theatres and continue to expand to additional locations. 
 We currently have auditoriums that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, which we refer to as motion seats, throughout our worldwide circuit. These motion seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and further immerse guests in the on-screen action. We offer motion seats in 121 theatres throughout our worldwide circuit.  
 Experienced Management. Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble, President-International Valmir Fernandes, and Executive Vice President and General Counsel Michael Cavalier, our global operational management team has extensive industry experience.  Additionally, our country general managers are local citizens familiar with cultural, political and economic factors impacting their country, which enables them to more effectively manage the local business. Our global management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles over the years and their leadership in steering the Company during the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to their abilities and effectiveness as stewards of the Company.

We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993. Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed one of the most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the region. We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in 15 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in South America. We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor. We also have significant market presence in Colombia, Peru and Chile. The following table summarizes the geographic locations of our international theatre circuit as of December 31, 2020.

Content 
 We offer a variety of content at our theatres.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, as we were reopening theatres, we offered primarily library content to our guests, and we added new releases as they became available.  We also offered our guests the ability to select a film for private viewing with our Private Watch Parties in a group of up to 20 family members and friends.  In normal operating times, we monitor upcoming films and other content and work diligently with film distributors to license content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres. We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films. We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in many locations, we offer either our exhibitor-branded premium large format, XD, or IMAX. We also offer a format that features motion seats and added sensory features.
 We regularly play art and independent films, under our CineArts banner, at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our guests. We have also historically offered a classic series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies from a variety of genres during non-peak times.  We also offer multi-cultural foreign language films and e-sports gaming events in our theatres.  
 Our joint venture, AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, provides marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres’ feature film schedules, which includes the Metropolitan Opera, sports programs, concert events, and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded. We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide alternative content to consumers beyond movies.
 Film Licensing
 In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres. In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors, local film distributors and independent content providers to license films for our international theatres. Film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures, while we are responsible for booking the films at each of our theatres at the optimal showtimes for our guests. 
 8

In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a film’s box office receipts at our theatres. Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a film’s run; a firm terms formula, as determined prior to a film’s run, under which we pay a negotiated rate; or a rate that is negotiated after a film’s run.  
 Food and Beverage 
 Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, historically representing approximately 35% of total revenues. We have devoted considerable management effort to expanding concession sales by enhancing our offerings and adapting to our customers’ changing preferences, as discussed below. 
 Product Mix. Common concession products offered at all of our theatres may include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, non-carbonated drinks, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream. The food and beverage offerings vary based on consumer preferences in a particular market. We have introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our guests, which are available at some locations, added alcohol offerings in a growing number of theatres, partnered with Pizza Hut to offer freshly-made Pizza Hut pizzas in select theatres, and also offer diverse ethnic foods based on market demographics. 
 In select locations, we have expanded concession product offerings to include a broader variety of food and drink options, such as gourmet pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches and a selection of beers, wines, and cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums.  
 Our proprietary point-of-sale system allows our category managers to monitor product sales and readily make adjustments to product mix on a theatre-by-theatre or market-by-market basis, when necessary. This program flexibility also allows us to efficiently activate and manage both national or regional product launches and promotional initiatives to further grow food and beverage sales.  
 Pricing. New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchase incidence by existing consumers as well as to attract new consumers. In certain international countries and in all of our domestic theatres, we offer a free loyalty program that routinely offers food and beverage discounts. Our paid Movie Club membership program also allows our domestic guests to sign-up for exclusive concessions discounts.
 During 2020, when we started reopening our U.S. theatres as government restrictions lifted, we limited our concession product offerings and implemented “Welcome Back” pricing discounts on core concessions (fountain soda, popcorn and candy) as well as select alcohol, hot dog and nacho products.  
 Staff Training. Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques, food preparation and handling and maintaining concession product quality. Some of our product promotions include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items. During 2020, we implemented enhanced food safety and cleanliness protocols to align with the Center for Disease Control’s, or CDC, COVID-19-specific recommendations relative to concession and restaurant areas.   
 Theatre Design. Our theatres are designed to optimize the guest purchase experience at the concession stands, which includes multiple concession counters throughout a theatre to facilitate serving guests in an expedited manner. We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands. We incorporate self-serve candy cases and bottled drink coolers at our traditional crew-serve theatres to help provide convenience for our guests, drive impulse purchases and increase product availability for these two core categories. We also have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready. This design allows for more efficient service, and superior visibility of concession items. We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in many domestic and international theatres.
 9

During the latter part of 2020, we implemented mobile concession ordering at approximately half of our U.S. theatres allowing guests to purchase and pre-pay for select concession products and pick them up at the concession stand upon arrival or have them delivered to their seat.
 Cost Control. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and also negotiate volume-based and promotional-based rebates. Concession supplies are generally managed through a distribution network in which inventory is delivered to the theatres after receiving orders directly from the theatres.  We conduct frequent inventory counts of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our guests.
 As previously mentioned, to focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we streamlined our menu offerings within each product category with a renewed focus on core brands and products.  While we still offer a broad assortment of food and beverage items, product streamlining has allowed us to closely manage inventory levels and reduce labor costs associated with more complex food offerings.     
 Screen Advertising
 In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM. NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded “Noovie” pre-show entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM’s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach our audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen rental revenue on a per patron basis or revenue share basis depending on the placement of the advertisement. As of December 31, 2020, we had an approximate 25% ownership interest in NCM. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM.
 Throughout our international markets, we have established our Flix Media brand that handles screen advertising functions in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Central America, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador and Curacao.  Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our theatres as well as other theatres in our markets. In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we continue to expand Flix Media’s services to include, among other things, alternative content, digital media and other synergistic media opportunities. In a few of our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar programming benefits. The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country; however, we generally earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues for access to our screens. 
 Upon reopening our theatres, we utilized our pre-show programming to remind guests about The Cinemark Standard, which encompasses our enhanced comprehensive cleaning and safety protocols.  
 Marketing and Promotions
 Our investment in digital marketing over the past several years enables us to expand our reach to our guests and communicate with them on a consistent basis regarding our promotions and offerings.  The growth in our digital communication ability has been particularly effective over the past year to keep our guests engaged, informed and excited about our theatre reopenings and “Welcome Back” offers.  We adapted our marketing strategy with an emphasis on consistent organic communication to keep our millions of guests informed through email, social media, and website and mobile app updates.  We also implemented strategic public relations campaigns, both nationally and locally.  We supplemented our organic communication with targeted advertising to communicate our enhanced cleaning and safety protocols, generate theatre reopening awareness and alert guests as to advance ticket sale dates.  
 
While awaiting a steady stream of new film content, marketing and promotions played a pivotal role in encouraging moviegoers to visit their local Cinemark theatres. We branded our library content “Comeback Classics” and had enticing “Welcome Back” pricing on those films, as well as for our limited concessions offerings. We continually initiated unique, interactive marketing campaigns, such as our Halloween giveaway and 12 Days of Merry. These campaigns drove loyal and prospective customers to visit our website and our theatres to earn discounts, bonus coupons and prizes.

In recognition that there was a segment of the audience who would prefer to visit our theatres and stay within their trusted group, we introduced Private Watch Parties. Our Private Watch Party program allows guests to rent an entire auditorium to watch a film that they choose from our current library and bring up to 20 guests for a price range of $99-$149. 
 
We automatically paused Movie Club subscriptions upon the initial closure of our theatres, alleviating the impact of recurring monthly payments on members while allowing them to maintain their benefits.  Additionally, we extended the expiration date of all loyalty points into 2021.
 In traditional times, we generally market our theatres and special events, including new theatre grand openings, remodel openings and VIP events, using email, organic and paid digital advertising, and radio and television advertising spots. We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program. We offer guests access to movie times, the ability to buy their tickets and reserve their seats in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications. Customers can subscribe to our emails and push notifications to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about upcoming XD movies, advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts, live broadcasts, contests, promotions, and our latest concessions and merchandise offerings. We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote upcoming films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres. 
 We interact with guests every day on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.  Through social media, we provide relevant information, quick access to advanced ticketing information and upcoming movies and events, as well as to respond to guest feedback. Guests can also utilize social media to ask questions regarding their local Cinemark theatre offerings, movie-related information or to provide suggestions.
 We launched a subscription membership program for our domestic circuit in December 2017 named Movie Club.  Movie Club offers guests a standard ticket credit, member-pricing for a companion ticket and concession and other transaction discounts for a monthly fixed price.  Movie Club is a unique option to reward our loyal guests and allows us to stay informed of our frequent guests’ preferences.
 We offer a free domestic loyalty program to our guests, named Movie Fan. Movie Fan allows our guests to earn one point for every dollar they spend.  Points can then be redeemed for tickets, concession items and discounts, as well as unique and limited-edition rewards that relate to films currently playing in our theatres. 
 We also have loyalty programs in some of our international markets that either allow customers to pay a nominal fee for an annual membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts or that allows guests to earn loyalty points for each purchase. Similar to the Movie Fan program, our points-based international programs offer discounts on movie tickets and concessions. Our global loyalty programs put us in direct contact with our guests and provide additional opportunities for us to partner with the studios and our vendors through targeted promotions. 
 Competition
 We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting guests, licensing films and developing new theatre sites. Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal and AMC and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cinépolis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), Village Cines, Hoyts Chile, SuperCines and Araujo.
 We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at many of our theatres. In certain limited situations, distributors allocate movies to only one theatre in a market generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. In all theatres, our success in attracting guests can depend on customer service quality, location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability and ticket prices.

We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues. Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as commercial terms, committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue potential, and financial stability.  
 We face competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment competing for the public’s leisure time and disposable income, such as family entertainment centers, concerts, theme parks and sporting events.  We also face competition for patrons from a number of alternative film distribution channels, such as streaming services, digital downloads, video on-demand, DVDs, pay television, network and syndicated television, and streaming video on demand. 
 Seasonality
 Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. The most successful motion pictures have historically been released during summer months in the U.S., extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from November through year-end. The timing of releases, however, has become less pronounced as distributors have begun releasing content more evenly throughout the year.  In our Latin American markets, while Hollywood content has similar release dates as in the U.S., the local holidays and seasons can vary. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can impact this seasonality trend. The timing, quantity and quality of film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the following period or for the same period in the following year.
Corporate Operations
 Our worldwide headquarters, referred to as the Cinemark Service Centre, or CSC, is located in Plano, Texas. Personnel at the CSC provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, and includes our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax and information technology. Our U.S. operations are comprised of twenty regions, each of which is headed by a regional vice president. We have nine regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fifteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are managed out of one Central American regional office). Each regional office is headed by a general manager or a member of our international management team with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and finance. We have divisional chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina and a regional chief financial officer located in Chile that oversees Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. 
Human Capital
 Our business is seasonal and therefore, our headcount can vary throughout the year depending on the timing and success of movie releases. While we do not have unionized employees within our domestic employee base, some of our international locations are subject to union regulations. 
 At the time we temporarily closed our theatres in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had approximately 18,000 employees in the U.S and approximately 10,500 employees in our international markets.  In response to the swift and significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we undertook a number of operational measures, which included temporary and permanent reductions of personnel. Our focus upon the reopening of our theatres was to re-hire our hourly team members who were impacted upon closure of our theatres.  We currently have approximately 8,300 employees in the U.S., approximately 30% of whom are full-time employees and 70% of whom are part-time employees. We have approximately 6,300 employees in our international markets, approximately 80% of whom are full-time employees and approximately 20% of whom are part-time employees. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the lives of our employees and we have taken steps to help protect their health and safety and maintain business continuity. A vast majority of our CSC employees continue to work remotely, which we expect will continue over the near term. The health and safety of our employees, guests and communities is a top priority.  As such, we established stringent, enhanced cleaning and safety protocols at our corporate offices and theatres, including mandatory face covering, physical distance requirements, enhanced

cleaning and mandatory temperature screening. We also implemented a COVID-19 hotline to report positive COVID-19 tests. As part of that reporting process, we developed a robust contact tracing program to quickly identify team members who may have been in close contact with the infected individual. 
 In our Mission, Vision and Values Statement, our employees form the core of our Cinemark Values, or our Values. We strive to (i) act with honesty and integrity, respect and care for each other, our guests, communities and partners, (ii) provide a safe environment for our employees and guests, (ii) be the best in what we do and (iv) empower our people to make decisions and take responsibility. Guided by our Values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We take pride in the fact that many of our employees, including executive management, international general managers and field employees, have significant tenure with the Company. A vast majority of our field employees who were hired as we started reopening our theatres were employed by us prior to the pandemic. 
 We seek to be an equitable, diverse and inclusive company. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. As part of our ongoing commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce, we support employee-driven support groups or Employee Resource Groups, or ERGs. The ERGs are open to all employees in the CSC and the Technology Operations Presentation, or TOP, Center and are based on employee interests such as work life balance, PRIDE, environmental, faith-based and cross-cultural. These groups help foster inclusion among all teammates, build awareness, recruit and retain a diverse workforce necessary for the Company to successfully operate in a global, multicultural, and evolving business environment. 
 To attract and retain the most qualified talent, we offer competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, paid time off, parental leave and a 401(k) retirement savings and investment plan with generous Company matching. We support the continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills of our employees by offering tuition assistance, skills development courses through partnerships with leading educational institutions, and leadership development and training both generally and as part of our diversity and inclusion initiatives.  Employees are encouraged to provide feedback about their experience through periodic employee engagement surveys. These voluntary surveys provide overall and department-specific reports and enables us to improve employee experience and culture. We aspire to provide a safe, open and accountable work environment for our employees. We provide a hotline for all employees to report workplace concerns and violations. We address such concerns and take appropriate actions that uphold our Values.
 Regulations
 The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors has been influenced by consent decrees resulting from these cases. Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis.
 We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items. Our domestic and international theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are subject to various cleaning, health and safety protocols, capacity restrictions and curfews, which can vary at the city, county and state level.
