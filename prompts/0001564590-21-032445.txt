Executive Summary of Our Business

 TYME is an emerging biotechnology company developing cancer metabolism-based therapies (CMBTsTM) that are intended to be effective across a broad range of solid tumors and hematologic cancers, while also maintaining patients’ quality of life through relatively low toxicity profiles. TYME’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic requirements to cause cancer cell death. Our lead first-in-class CMBT compound is SM-88 (racemetryrosine). Early clinical results demonstrated by SM-88 in multiple advanced cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, sarcomas and breast, reinforce the potential of our emerging CMBT pipeline. Moreover, we also believe our pipeline offers hope to patients for a new future in long-term management of various cancers. 
 
Our lead clinical CMBT compound, SM-88, is an oral investigational modified proprietary tyrosine derivative that is hypothesized to interrupt the metabolic processes of cancer cells by breaking down the cells’ key defenses and leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. To date, clinical trial data have shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher adverse events, which we believe is rare for investigational compounds.
 
Strategic Review
 
In November 2020, TYME appointed Richard Cunningham as its new Chief Executive Officer. His initial priority was to build a management team better equipped to transition the Company to its next phase of growth. In January 2021, he commenced a comprehensive strategic review examining every facet of the Company. The goals of the review were to assess the Company’s existing opportunities, explore untapped opportunities that may have been overlooked and maximize the efficiency of our capital expenditures in an effort to unlock TYME’s full potential. In February 2021, Mr. Cunningham led an effort to raise $100 million in capital that we believe will provide significant runway for the Company to execute on its move-forward strategy.
 
The strategic review process encompassed an extensive review of internal and external resources, the design of and results from our preclinical and clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for pipeline candidates, the costs and complexities of manufacturing to ensure a safe and sustainable supply of investigational compounds can be delivered to patients, the potential of competing products, the likelihood of any challenges to our intellectual property, regardless of merit, the ongoing and potential effects of COVID-19 or any future pandemics, and industry and market conditions generally. The review included internal and external assessments by industry experts, key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) and advisors with considerable experience in the various areas we sought to probe and explore.  
 
The strategic review process resulted in the following key takeaways: 
 
First in Human study and Compassionate Use Program data with responses across 15 cancer types shows potential for broad development options, however focus is critical.  
 
The First in Human (“FIH”) study was designed as a safety study enrolling all-comers of solid tumors that had exhausted or refused available treatment options. Ultimately the trial yielded a 33% objective response rate (“ORR”) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (“RECIST”) criteria, another 57% experiencing stable disease for median duration of 11 months, and a median overall survival of 29.8 months. The results of the FIH study were published in the journal, Investigational New Drugs, in March 2019. This trial, together with the Compassionate Use Program, as described below under the caption “Completed Studies”, ultimately resulted in observed anti-tumor responses in 15 different cancer types, and with minimal drug-related serious Grade 3 or higher serious adverse events. These results offer TYME multiple potential development options, however, they also highlight the importance of focusing in on the 
 7


settings that offer the most strategic approach, as well as on following our scientific and biomarker findings.
 
Breast cancer is a priority indication for development. 
 
Our review of the results from study of SM-88 for the treatment of breast cancer in the FIH study and Compassionate Use programs indicate that hormone receptor positive (“HR+”) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (“HER2-“) disease (“HR+/HER2-“) is a distinct opportunity. Accordingly, we have identified breast cancers as a strategic priority as we look to expand our indications within our portfolio for SM-88 and to validate previously seen results in areas of unmet need. Anti-tumor activity was observed in several key breast cancer conditions, however, the strongest data were in the patients with HR+/HER2- disease where complete responses were observed. Furthermore, important changes are occurring in the treatment paradigm of this patient group. In particular, a broadly used and successful class of drugs, CDK4/6 inhibitors, previously approved for use in advanced lines of metastatic therapy, has since been approved and is transitioning use to earlier stages of metastatic disease, as well as pre-metastatic settings. There are limited FDA-approved treatment options following CDK4/6 inhibitors in this disease, other than chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, we believe SM-88’s safety and efficacy profile could offer an alternative treatment option for these patients prior to advancing to chemotherapy treatment. To address this, together with clinicians at Georgetown University, we entered into an agreement to conduct a trial to study the activity and overall profile of SM-88 for use in patients after failing or progressing on a CDK4/6 inhibitor, as an alternative to a chemotherapy option. The Phase II OASIS trial, as described below under the caption “Ongoing Studies”, will be conducted at several Georgetown University/MEDSTAR sites, enrolling up to 50 women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer after failing or progressing after a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
 
Pancreatic cancer second-line Precision Promise trial is the priority in this cancer. 
 
We undertook a comprehensive review of the two ongoing trials evaluating SM-88 in pancreatic cancer—Precision Promise, the Pancreatic Cancer Network-sponsored trial that is evaluating SM-88 as a second-line therapy, and TYME-88-Panc (Part 2), our clinical trial evaluating SM-88 as a third-line therapy. As part of that process, we reviewed our overall pancreatic cancer clinical trial spending and evaluated the cost benefit per investment to determine how they might each impact the Company and our overall strategy. Our findings indicated we were wholly invested in one indication with nearly all of our aggregate clinical investment in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we identified that the two concurrent pancreatic cancer trials in third-line and second-line appear to be operating on similar enrollment timelines and determined that there were more efficient uses of capital.
 
The enrollment rates for TYME-88-Panc trial have progressed more slowly than the Company initially anticipated, due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our current projections for enrollment for these trials indicate that Precision Promise is likely to complete enrollment in a similar timeline to TYME-88-Panc, (Part 2). Furthermore, while considering additional investments in TYME-88-Panc to accelerate enrollment, we identified higher-than-expected drop-out rates in patients randomized to the chemotherapy control arm, which could potentially impact the interpretive and regulatory utility of the data. Based on the comparative enrollment rates, the potential to reach patients earlier in disease progression in the second-line Precision Promise trial, potential impacts on data utility and expected resources needed for study success, we made the decision to focus our resource allocation and development priorities toward second-line treatments with the Precision Promise trial and other indications could provide a diversified portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has decided to stop enrollment in TYME-88-Panc and to begin the process of closing down the trial.
 
Need to identify targeted patient populations. 
 
The number of clinical trials incorporating pharmacogenomic and/or pharmacogenetic analysis to stratify patients for predictive response, safety, or dosing, has more than doubled since 2010 and represents 42% of oncology trials in 2019. Predictive biomarker-based therapies are designed to predict tumor response to a specific therapy by providing information regarding which molecular alterations are driving cancer growth. 
 8


Predictive biomarkers can be used to select for which patient population a treatment is likely to have an effect and can enable TYME to employ a more targeted approach, which could result in better trial designs, and potentially deliver better outcomes for patients and increase the likelihood of future clinical success. Therefore, the Company launched a SM-88 biomarker initiative. As part of this initiative, we have engaged a leading global drug discovery, research and development company, as well as leading academic institutions to assist us in expanding our understanding of the biological mechanisms of SM-88, and other potentially targetable aspects of cancer metabolism. Our goals are to identify actionable biomarkers of sensitivity and activity of SM-88 in different cancers, as well as to identify potential combination strategies for SM-88 with existing standards of care. The work to support the biomarker initiative is expected to include use of existing cancer models, human derived cancer models and organoids, as well as patient genomic samples and ultimately patient tumor biopsy analysis. Some of the analyses planned include genomic analysis, gene transcription analysis, epigenetic changes, and alterations in multiple aspects of cellular metabolism. Together with our collaborators, we intend to use these findings to identify potential patient biomarkers and to attempt to validate them in future clinical settings.  
 
Need to identify clear development pathway for TYME-19. 
 COVID-19 and the landscape for TYME-19 are each rapidly evolving, which highlights the importance of navigating the environment appropriately. As we progress the TYME-19 preclinical program, we will assess the changing market and potential partners as we continue our focus in oncology.
 Our Pipeline
 

SM-88 Ongoing Studies
 
Precision Promise (second-line Pancreatic cancer)
 
In 2019, we entered into an agreement for SM-88 to be included in an experimental arm in the novel Precision Promise adaptive randomized Phase II/III trial platform (“Precision Promise”) with registration intent sponsored by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (“PanCAN”). The objective of Precision Promise is to expedite the study and approval of promising therapies for pancreatic cancer by bringing multiple stakeholders together, including academic, industry and regulatory entities.
 
In this trial which began in early 2020, SM-88 with the conditioning agents methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus (“MPS”) is being studied as monotherapy treatment arm for patients who have failed one prior line of 
 9


chemotherapy. PanCAN is sponsoring Precision Promise and providing funding and other support. While TYME’s SM-88 is included in the trial, we do not oversee, conduct or control the trial.
 
In patients with pancreatic cancer treated previously with SM-88 from both the Phase II TYME-88-Panc trial, the FIH study, and Compassionate Use Program, a majority of patients with tumor responses and long-term stable disease occurred in less heavily pretreated patients with one or fewer prior lines of systemic therapy.  
 
In the US, there are about 60,000 new diagnosis of pancreatic cancer each year, and 80% of these cases are not eligible for potentially curative surgery. Of the approximately 40,000 metastatic patients who start systemic therapy, unfortunately, most patients relapse. Physician consultants have reported that approximately half of these first-line patients ultimately receive a second-line systemic treatment.  The FDA-approved treatment options for second-line metastatic pancreatic cancer are limited, and several older chemotherapy combinations currently represent the current standard of care (NCCN guidelines). According to estimates from American Cancer Society, Evaluate Pharma, The Oncology Pharmacist (April 2020), and Syneos Health, the estimated potential U.S. market in 2019 for first-, second-, and third-line branded pancreatic cancer therapies reached $3.8 billion, $2.0 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively.
 
Although we do not have details of the enrollment of the SM-88 cohort, the next likely event in the trial would be a determination of potential “graduation” from the Phase II portion of the trial to the Phase III confirmatory portion of the trial. This determination occurs based on the survival of up to the first 100 patients.  If SM-88 “graduates”, the goal of the Phase III trial is to enroll up to an additional 75 patients to accumulate sufficient statistical data to confirm the level of benefits observed. The FDA has stated that positive data from this trial could be used to support a NDA application.  
 
OASIS (Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer After CDK4/6 Inhibitors)
 
In June 2021, we announced an agreement with Georgetown University to support a Phase II trial for SM-88 in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have HR+/HER2-. This represents approximately 73% of the annual breast cancer diagnosis in the US each year. According to estimates from Data Monitor and Syneos Health, there are approximately 150,000 metastatic breast cancer diagnoses in the US each year.  According to Data Monitor, company reported sales figures, and Syneos Health analyses, the total 2019 U.S. market revenues for drug treatment for metastatic breast cancer were $7.7 billion.
 
The OASIS trial is an investigator-initiated prospective open-label Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SM-88 with MPS for the treatment of metastatic hormone-receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. This trial is designed as a two-stage trial, enrolling up to 50 patients to receive SM-88 with MPS without additional therapies in patients who have failed or progressed after receiving two hormonal agents and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.  The primary endpoint of this trial is ORR, with secondary endpoints including duration of response (“DOR”), clinical benefit rate (“CBR”) at >24 weeks, progression free survival (“PFS”), and safety. The trial will be conducted at Georgetown University at a total of five sites within the Georgetown/MEDSTAR system located in Washington DC, Maryland, and New Jersey. Patient enrollment is expected to begin in the third quarter of calendar year 2021.
 
This trial is being conducted as a follow up to the encouraging anti-tumor efficacy observed from the initial trials of SM-88 in this specific patient sub-group. In the FIH study and Compassionate Use Program, several heavily pretreated metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients displayed tumor responses to SM-88, including several complete responses. This trial is aimed to further explore this signal and will also collect cell-free DNA from patients from different time-points with a goal of better understanding potential biomarkers of response and other aspects of SM-88’s mechanism of action. TYME has also established an academic collaboration with an investigator at Georgetown University to explore the mechanism of SM-88 and MPS, including models of CDK 4/6 resistance. 
 
HoPES Trial (Ewing’s Sarcoma, and Mixed Refractory Sarcoma)
 
In early 2020, the open-label Phase 2 investigator sponsored trial of SM-88 therapy in sarcoma opened. This trial has two cohorts each expecting to enroll 12 patients. The first is SM-88 with MPS as salvage treatment in patients with mixed rare sarcomas, and the other is SM-88 with MPS as maintenance treatment for patients with metastatic 
 10


Ewing’s sarcoma who had not progressed on prior therapy.  The primary objectives are to measure ORR and PFS. Secondary objectives include duration of response, OS, CBR using RECIST, and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The Joseph Ahmed Foundation is providing funding and patient support for this trial, and the trial is being conducted by principal investigator Dr. Chawla at the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica, CA. 
 
Initial results from approximately 13 patients were published in the Proceedings for the 2021 ASCO General Meeting. These results included several patients with long-term stable disease, and the median duration of treatment on SM-88 was significantly longer than the respective treatments the patient received in the most recent line of therapy. Additionally, there have been no reported drug-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) related to SM-88. 
 
The trial was initiated after anti-tumor efficacy and other clinical benefits were observed in several patients with Ewing’s Sarcoma and other heavily pre-treated sarcomas in the FIH study and Compassionate Use Program. This included objective tumor responses in two Ewing’s sarcoma patients. Upon review of the data, Dr. Chawla approached TYME with an interest in examining SM-88 in a clinical trial.  
 
Ewing’s Sarcoma is an ultra-rare cancer that can affect adolescents and younger adults, with approximately 200 cases diagnosed in the US per year.  Broadly there are over 50 types of sarcomas, totaling about 12,000 new cases diagnosed in the US each year. While there have been some recent developments for certain sarcomas, there remains a high need for additional effective therapies, especially for patients with metastatic disease.  
 
SM-88 Biomarker Initiative 
 
Following feedback from the recent strategic review, the Company has begun a comprehensive translational biomarker initiative. We have employed a multi-faceted approach incorporating a leading global drug discovery, research and development company together with several complementary academic collaborators. The overall goals of this initiative are to identify targeted patient populations with actionable biomarkers of sensitivity and/or activity to SM-88 in various cancers, to identify potential complementary combination drugs strategies for SM-88, and potentially to identify other cancer metabolism targets for treatment. Additionally, we intend to incorporate liquid and tumor biopsies to future clinical trials in furtherance of these biomarker identification goals. We anticipate this initiative will have several stages, and to last likely over at least this 2022 fiscal year and potentially beyond.
Mayo Collaboration
 
In March 2021, TYME expanded its pancreatic cancer research collaboration with Mayo Clinic to perform in-depth analysis of pancreatic cancer cell gene expression, epigenetic, and metabolism changes from SM-88 treatment. In addition, the collaborator at Mayo has created and characterized multiple pancreatic cancer organoids that could help in the identification of biomarkers and examine the possible impact SM-88 has on the tumor microenvironment.   
 
NYU Collaboration
 
In July 2019, TYME began a research collaboration with NYU School of Medicine examining multiple aspects of SM-88 mechanisms. The work is expected to explore the impact of SM-88 on clinical models, including viability, general pharmacodynamics, genomic and RNA transcription analysis, and detailed impact on cancer metabolism. In addition, patient derived cancer models, and related animal experiments will explore immunohistochemical signals of SM-88 effects and comprehensive immunomodulatory impact of the tumor microenvironment, as well as exploration of SM-88 in combination with standard approved cancer therapies.  
 
Georgetown Collaboration
 
In May 2021, TYME initiated a research collaboration with a research investigator at Georgetown University, to examine the effects of SM-88 in breast cancer. This collaboration will examine the effects of SM-88 and MPS in various breast cancer models in culture and animal models. The project will explore metabolomics, gene expression analysis, and protein array analysis following SM-88 exposure to characterized cancer cell lines, including cell lines with acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Preclinical Pipeline Programs
 
TYME-19 – For COVID-19
 
TYME-19 is an oral, synthetically produced member of the bile acid family that is being developed for the potential treatment of COVID-19. From the Company’s metabolic understanding of bile acids, it was able to identify TYME-19 as a well characterized candidate and a potential treatment of corona viruses. A patent has been issued for TYME-19 for the treatment of COVID-19.
 
Bile acids can cellular modulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as remediate dysregulated protein folding each that are relevant to viral infection of a host cell. Existing literature has shown that certain bile acids can have antiviral properties in a range of different viruses, including prior corona viruses.   
 
Our initial preclinical in vitro experiments displayed effectiveness against COVID-19 infection and replication, and we will continue to conduct additional preclinical experiments to support the potential utility of TYME-19 in the treatment of COVID-19 and disease variants. With the ever-changing dynamics of this disease area, the Company’s intent with this program is to prepare this agent for clinical testing, while learning from the ongoing work in an effort to identify an optimal clinical setting where TYME-19 could potentially offer clinical benefits and for which there may be a sustainable market.    
 
Given TYME’s focus on oncology, we expect that at the proper time, identifying a potential partner to assist in the ongoing development of this asset may be an opportune strategic pathway.
 
TYME-18 – Intra-Tumoral Therapy
 
TYME-18 is a pre-clinical CMBT compound that is designed to be delivered intratumorally. TYME-18 is a combination of a proprietary surfactant system and natural sulfonic/bile acid that is designed to disrupt energy metabolism and have lytic function for potential treatment of inoperable tumors.  TYME-18 is distinct in composition from SM-88. However, like SM-88, it aims to enhance the susceptibility of a cancer to the highly acidic and toxic tumor microenvironment, while minimizing the impact to normal tissues. 
 
In initial preclinical xenograft mouse studies, TYME-18 was able to completely resolve over 90 percent (11/12 mice) of established colorectal tumors within 12 days versus an average of over 600 percent growth in the control animals. 
 
TYME-18 is currently in preclinical development, and as with TYME-19, we expect at the proper time, to identify a potential partner with a focus on surgical oncology to assist in the ongoing development of TYME-18. 
 
Completed Studies
 
First in Human Study
 
The FIH study was the initial clinical trial with SM-88, which began in 2012 and was conducted in 30 actively progressing metastatic cancer patients who had failed or refused all available treatments options. The Phase I study was designed to assess the safety of monotherapy SM-88, although the trial was extended beyond the initial six-week period based on reported treatment efficacy, with several patients remaining on treatment for over 12 months. Patients were given SM-88 with conditioning agents melanin, melanotan II, phenytoin, and sirolimus (these conditioning agents will hereafter be referred to as “M2PS”).
 
The results of the FIH study were published in the journal, Investigational New Drugs, in March 2019, including data from the trial’s initiation in January 2012 through September 2017. Patients were treated with monotherapy SM-88 and achieved median overall survival (“OS”) of 29.8 months, median PFS of 13 months, and a 33% ORR. The ORR consisted of four complete responses (“CR”) and six partial responses (“PR”), based on RECIST.  In addition, 57% of patients (17/30) achieved RECIST stable disease (“SD”) with a median SD duration of 11 months. Five FIH study patients with metastatic cancer survived for over five years after commencing SM-88 treatment. All FIH study patients improved or maintained Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (“ECOG 
 12


PS”), a measure of quality of life, after initiating SM-88 therapy, and OS was comparable for patients who entered the trial with ECOG PS ranging from 0 (asymptomatic) to 2 (unable to perform any work-related activities).
 
We believe that traditional RECIST response criteria, a commonly used clinical endpoint based primarily on computerized tomography (“CT”) images, may not fully reflect the therapeutic benefit from SM-88. This is based in part on the observation in the FIH study where a total of 17 of the 30 patients achieved SD with median OS of 29.0 months. Because we believe many patients on SM-88 experience therapeutic benefit without necessarily achieving a CR or PR under RECIST criteria, we commonly refer to “Clinical Benefit,” which includes CR, PR and SD designations.
 
SM-88 used with M2PS demonstrated a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. All related adverse events (“AEs”) for SM-88 were classified as mild or moderate. The most common treatment AEs experienced included hyperpigmentation by 100% of patients (30/30), fatigue by 56.7% of patients (17/30) and pain by 10% of patients (3/30). No dose limiting toxicities were observed. 
 
Compassionate Use Program
 
In parallel with and following the FIH study, we also allowed advanced cancer patients’ access to SM-88 through a compassionate use program under Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) supervision (the “Compassionate Use Patients”). In early 2018, we performed a retrospective analysis on 53 Compassionate Use Patients who had available data and received at least six weeks of treatment. These patients had their scans reviewed by independent radiologists to determine response under RECIST, and 75% of these patients (40 of 53) were deemed to have experienced Clinical Benefit, consisting of 8 CRs, 16 PRs and 16 SD designations.
 
Through these two programs, patients being treated with SM-88 have achieved confirmed responses across 15 different cancer types, including some of the most common and difficult to treat cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, lung, glioma, ovarian, sarcoma and colon cancer. Based on preliminary data from the FIH study and the Compassionate Use Patients suggesting SM-88 may have broad potential applicability and acceptable toxicity, we believe that SM-88 may ultimately be utilized as a treatment for a wide range of cancers prior to the end-stage setting.
 
Phase II Prostate Trial
 
In 2019 we completed our Phase II clinical data for bio-marker recurrent prostate cancer and the final results were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Investigational New Drugs, on September 13, 2020. 
 
The Phase II trial of SM-88 in patients with non-metastatic, biochemical-recurrent prostate cancer enrolled 23 patients with rising prostate-specific antigen levels, detectable circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) and no radiographically detectable metastases. The study duration was six months, per the study protocol, although some patients were granted a waiver to remain on treatment for longer periods. Seventy-four percent (74%) of patients (17/23) had previously received androgen deprivation therapy as treatment for prostate cancer. All enrolled patients were given daily oral SM-88 with MPS for the duration of treatment.
 
Based on data as of September 2019, 100% of patients (23/23) on trial remained free of metastatic progression and 87% of patients (20/23) maintained radiographic progression-free survival (“rPFS”) with a median duration of 6.5 months from the initial diagnoses of prostate specific antigen (“PSA”) rise. All patients who maintained rPFS also exhibited meaningful reductions in CTCs.
 
All patients with available CTC results for at least 3 cycles (n=19) achieved a decrease from baseline, with a median decrease of 65.3% at the end of 3 cycles. The median baseline PSA for patients with radiographic progression was 13.4 compared to 5.6 for patients with no radiographic progression (p=0.02). 13% of patients experienced a PSA progression after commencing therapy and 52% of patients (12/23) experienced an improvement in median PSA doubling time, a positive prognostic indicator.  
 
13



The SM-88 therapy was well tolerated in all patients in the trial. There were no treatment-related SAEs. No adverse events resulted in dose delay, discontinuation, or reduction. The majority of Grade 1 adverse events that were deemed possibly or probably related to the SM-88 investigational therapy were gastrointestinal in nature.
 
Discontinuing Programs
 
TYME-88-PANC (Part 2) (third-line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer)
 
In fiscal year 2020, we launched our pivotal study for SM-88 in the third-line treatment of pancreatic cancer through an amendment to our ongoing TYME-88-Panc trial, with the first patient dosed in December 2019. As described above, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted enrollment of this trial, such that it appears it is likely to complete enrollment in a similar timeline to the second-line Precision Promise pancreatic cancer trial. There has also been a higher than expected dropout of patients randomized to the chemotherapy control arm, which could potentially impact the interpretative and regulatory utility of the data. 
 
Following a comprehensive strategic review, considering, in part, the timeline and regulatory utility for this trial compared to the parallel Precision Promise trial and concentration of investment in this specific cancer, management concluded that it would be best to focus on the second-line Precision Promise trial that offers treatment options to patients earlier in their disease. Furthermore, the trial includes tumor biopsy and biomarker analyses that aligns with the Company’s overall strategic focus to identifying patients with the best chance of benefit from our therapies.    
 
Therefore, the Company has decided to stop enrollment and begin the process of closing down the trial. Patients currently on therapy will be allowed to continue treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The closing of this trial may require several months to complete. 
 
SM-88 Mechanism of Action
 
SM-88 is an orally administered cancer metabolism-based therapy that is chemically altered to be non-functional for fundamental tumor cell processes, including protein synthesis. Scientific literature has highlighted that cancer cells can have a significantly higher consumption of certain amino acids compared to healthy cells, and these amino acids are required for cancer cell growth and function. We believe that SM-88, our proprietary modified dysfunctional tyrosine is selectively consumed by cancer cells, and interrupts various cell functions, including protein synthesis, autophagy, and other cellular defenses, that ultimately leads to an oxidative stress-related apoptosis or cell death. We also believe this selective cancer uptake of non-essential amino acids is supported by the current safety profile for SM-88, that has shown minimal observed drug-related SAEs. 
 
SM-88 is currently administered with the conditioning agents MPS. The conditioning agents are administered at doses between 5% and 25% of their FDA approved doses in non-cancer indications. We believe, based on scientific literature of their respective biologic functions, the physiologic, but sub-therapeutic doses of these agents may augment either the uptake of SM-88 or destabilize cancer cells to increase their susceptibility to SM-88’s effects.  
 
As a result of our strategic review, the Company intends to significantly increase its investment on exploring SM-88’s mechanism of action and the current dosing regimen. We have engaged with the global research and development firm, Evotec, to aid in the execution of these activities. The Company has also expanded its academic pre-clinical research collaborations, including with the Mayo Clinic, Georgetown University, and NYU School of Medicine. In addition, in our recently announced OASIS breast cancer trial, the investigators will be collecting cell-free DNA from patients throughout their treatment. Working with a leading diagnostics company, the Company aims to leverage these samples to better understand response dynamics for SM-88 and to begin to identify potential biomarkers for SM-88 response and sensitivity. 
 
The overall goals of these efforts are to potentially identify patient subsets or disease biomarkers that could be applied to patient selection in future, clinical trials, as well as identify potential optimal combinations with other anti-cancer mechanisms that could aid future clinical development.

Development Strategy and Key Product Properties
 
Our goal is to develop the Company’s clinical programs that may help patients live longer and better lives through novel medicines that are both better and safer treatments than current cancer treatment options. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Successfully advance the development of SM-88 across a broad range of cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work towards identifying actionable biomarkers for patient selection or treatment response to SM-88. We have begun research with several collaborators with an aim to identify potential biomarkers for patient selection for treatment with SM-88.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to invest in our technology platform and expand the breadth and depth of our IP portfolio. We plan to expand our research and development (“R&D”) efforts to encompass multiple cancer indications in both solid tumors and hematologic cancers. We have undertaken early development programs for additional delivery systems of our lead oral candidate, SM-88, as well as new investigational pipeline candidates to treat cancer patients with high unmet medical needs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We plan to independently develop and commercialize multiple drug candidates for human indications within the oncology field. For targets outside our core areas of interest or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate potential collaborations with strategic partners and/or potential acquisitions of other companies and/or their assets that can augment our expertise and technology, as well as a means to acquire rights or ownership of additional intellectual property (“IP”). We also contemplate exploring global development partners and arrangements, where appropriate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By using SM-88 to disrupt key aspects of cancer’s unique metabolism, our intention is to create an innovative therapeutic approach that is:
 
 
• | Broadly effective across different cancer types – Because a vast majority of cancers use the same metabolic process, known as the Warburg Effect, we believe that they could likely also have the same susceptibilities to SM-88 treatment, regardless of physiologic origin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly specific to cancer – As supported by the current safety data reported for approximately 180 patients, together with recent advances in radiographic imaging that use tyrosine-based agents to selectively image cancer cells, cancer appears to have a high affinity for tyrosine uptake compared to normal cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-tolerated/ broad therapeutic margin – Safety findings are available for approximately 180 patients, and only two patients (1%) have reported any drug-related serious adverse events;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy – Although most of TYME’s clinical and compassionate use experience has been in monotherapy, SM-88’s differentiated mechanism of action and safety profile may also allow it to be effective in combination with other cancer therapeutics; and

• | Potentially effective treatment for patients who have failed other therapeutic options – Current cancer therapies are often intended to inhibit or change a particular aspect of cancer’s cellular function, known as selective pressure. However, cancers typically develop resistance mechanisms that can make them less responsive to subsequent selective pressure treatments, while at the same time patients also accumulate treatment-related toxicities that can make them ineligible for subsequent therapies. SM-88 is designed to avoid selective pressure and this fundamental limitation of traditional therapies by utilizing cancer’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. We believe this novel mechanism of action may allow SM-88 to be used in traditional treatment-resistant patients and also limit development of resistance.

Intellectual Property
 
We will strive to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including through seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights (when required), whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also intend to rely on trade secrets related to our proprietary technology platform and our know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer treatment, which may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions, where available. 
 
Our commercial success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed IP, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing such products, as well as being held valid if challenged.
 
TYME maintains a broad intellectual property portfolio of 217 patent applications granted and/or pending worldwide. The patents encompass SM-88 as well as inventions that fight cancer and aid in the creation of novel mechanisms to further that effort. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have and will continue to seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: pharmaceutical compositions, methods for treating diseases of interest, methods for manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions and research tools and methods. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We will also seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
 
We believe we have no need to license any technologies for SM-88 to be commercially viable. We believe our Company owns all the IP necessary for SM-88 to perform as intended and to be commercially marketed, once all applicable regulatory requirements have been obtained. Additionally, we believe the drug substances utilized in SM-88 are not covered by any patents that would impede our use of such drug substances.
 
We also rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. Our trademark portfolio currently consists of one domestic trademark: CMBTs (cancer metabolism-based therapies).
CompetitionOur business strategy is intended to effectively position SM-88 for competition with products manufactured by other companies in the highly fragmented and competitive cancer treatment market. Our competition comes from other commercial and research enterprises working in the field of cancer research. This includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, patient advocacy groups and hospitals and government private research institutes around the globe.
 16


Important competitive factors include patient safety, effectiveness, quality-of-life and ease of use of products; price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; payor access and research and development of new products and processes. Most new products we intend to market, assuming regulatory approval, will and must compete with other products already on the market as well as products that are later developed by existing or new competitors. If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products would be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased volume of sales or both. Increasingly, to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers, managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, we would be required to demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also more value as compared with other treatment regimens.
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development and regulatory plans in addition to proprietary scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages, we currently have limited financial resources and no revenue source and face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, each of which has significantly greater financial resources than us. Any drugs that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new potential therapies that may become available in the future.
 Our products, if approved for sale, would eventually be subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Manufacturers of generic biopharmaceuticals generally invest far less in R&D and marketing than R&D companies such as us. We anticipate that any manufacturer of a generic version of our drugs will invest far less than we have in the past and intend to do in the future. They therefore, have the advantage in that they can price their drugs much lower than the brand-name drugs for which we obtain approval. Additionally, in many countries outside the United States, IP protection is weak or nonexistent and we would be forced to compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products in such countries whether or not we hold legal exclusivity.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. Our products once approved, would compete not only with other drugs, but also with such other types of therapies and treatments.
 There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer with currently marketed therapies providing benefits to many patients, these therapies often are limited to some extent by a lack of efficacy and/or the significance or frequency of AEs.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant, additional competition for SM-88.
 FDA Approval Process
 SM-88 is subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as a drug product. The FDA subjects drug products to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), the Federal Food, Drug and 
 17


Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and the import and export of drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or fines or civil or criminal penalties.
 The drug development process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conducting of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (“GLP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND submission within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing IND file.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must be submitted to an IRB for review and approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a clinical site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions to assure subject safety. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and is tested to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, AEs associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products targeted for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, as well as identification of common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II, Phase III trials are initiated to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish data sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Trials 
 18


conducted outside of the U.S. under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product licensing.
 Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design and trial results, in FDA public databases. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most controlled clinical trials of FDA-regulated products.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA review and approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology and CMC and must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product based on these results. The NDA must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial and is in addition to the costs of conducting clinical trials. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, as well as annual product and establishment user fees, which may total several million dollars and are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drugs are reviewed within 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can extend these timelines if necessary and its review may not occur on a timely basis at all. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, which present complex questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug product unless it verifies that compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) standards is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication(s) being studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional nonclinical or clinical testing or supplemental information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information that was included. FDA approval is never guaranteed, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to further ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 As of March 31, 2021, we have two active INDs with the FDA, both of which are associated with SM-88. The two INDs are active with the relevant FDA departments that oversee our ongoing trials, the Department of Oncology Products 1 (“DOP1”) and the Department of Oncology Products 2 (“DOP2”).  In addition, clinical investigators 
 19


have previously and may in the future request their own INDs in order to use SM-88 or other products in Investigator Initiated Trials (“IITs”).  For example, the HopES trial for sarcoma is an IIT where the IND for SM-88 use is held directly by the clinical trial site. 
 Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Related Requirements
 The FDA may grant an NDA a priority review designation based both upon the request of an applicant and the results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in the NDA. This designation sets the target date at six months for FDA action on the application. Priority review is granted where preliminary trial results indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy for a situation where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or where the product is possibly a significant improvement over existing marketed products. If these criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months. However, priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for regulatory approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. There can be no assurance that we would be able to satisfy the eligibility criteria for priority review or to receive regulatory approval under either standard review.
 Breakthrough Therapy Approvals
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act provides another designation for an expedited FDA review process called Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If an investigational drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the drug will be eligible for all fast track designation features, including expedited development and review of such drug for trial and market approval. Interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy Designation are to be reviewed within 60 days of receipt and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track Program
 The fast track program, a provision of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (“FDAMA”), is designed to facilitate interactions between a sponsor and the FDA before and during submission of an NDA for an investigational agent that, alone or in combination with one or more drugs, that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for that disease or condition. Under the fast track program, the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, if the FDA determines, after a preliminary evaluation of the clinical data, that a fast track drug may be effective. A fast track designation provides the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA and could make the drug eligible for and accelerated approval priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of submission of the NDA.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits having an effective approval date for an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for another version of such drug during the five-year exclusive period; however, submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA containing a paragraph IV certification is permitted after four years, which may trigger a 30-month stay of approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the submission or approval of another “full” NDA; however, the applicant for the “full” NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or strengths of a currently approved 
 20


drug, if new clinical investigations conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the new or supplemental NDA.
 In addition to non-patent marketing exclusivity, the Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require each NDA sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product (formulation and composition) and method-of-use for which the applicant submitted the NDA and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of the drug. Generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) must certify to each listed patent. The Orange Book is a listing of all drug products that have been approved by the FDA and their generic equivalences. We intend to submit for Orange Book listing all relevant patents for SM-88 and to vigorously defend any Orange Book-listed patents for our approved products.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years after the FDA approves a marketing application. The patent term extension period is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA and all the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, up to a total of five years. Only one patent applicable to a regulatory review period that represents the first commercial marketing of that drug is eligible for the extension and it must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension. We will consider applying for a patent term extension for some of our patents, to add patent life beyond the expiration date, depending on our ability to meet certain legal requirements permitting such extension and the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of an NDA. There can be no assurance that such an extension, if applied for, will be granted.
 Advertising and Promotion
 The FDA prohibits the pre-approved marketing and promotion of drugs and closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including through standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
 Drugs may be marketed only after initial approval and only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes to indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original and resubmitted NDAs.
 AE Reporting and cGMP Compliance
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain manufacturing subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects’ entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product 
 21


removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if the product encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition; generally, a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. annually. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for the product for treatment of the specified indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost in the United States if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 In July 2020, the Company received from the FDA orphan drug designation for SM-88, as a potential treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments.
International Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no near-term plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on, third party contract manufacturers for supplies of SM-88 for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the initial commercial manufacture of any products that we may market following regulatory approval.
 We currently purchase all our drug substance and drug products from contract manufacturers and intend to continue to do so on an as-needed purchase order basis. We have entered into limited term supply arrangements for certain SM-88 components related to supply for our clinical activities in order to secure favorable pricing terms. We intend to identify and qualify any further necessary contract manufacturers to provide all active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and finished drug product services during the IND stages and before submission of an NDA to the FDA.
 22


We have started some focused precommercial technical development activities toward commercial manufacturing. These precommercial manufacturing activities are expected to be able to support ongoing clinical manufacturing activities as needed. Our current intention is that, during the ongoing development of SM-88, other than our limited and focused precommercial activities, we will transition the needed manufacturing, CMC and GMP programs towards commercial third-party manufacturing when appropriate. The overall manufacturing program includes, but is not limited to, the development of product and process specifications, producing and validating standards and the development of suitable analytical methods for test and release, as well as stability testing. Before and during the use of contract manufacturers, we (or qualified designee) will conduct audits to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. Our manufacturers themselves must comply with their in-house quality assurance programs and be available for inspections by regulatory agencies, including the FDA and European drug regulatory agencies. During the development of our drug candidates, we anticipate scaling the manufacturing process to a suitable size. Increasing scale involves several steps and may involve modification of the process, in which case modifications to our CMC sections will occur, with continuous submissions to the FDA and EU regulatory authorities.
 As we progress through the regulatory approval process, there is a possibility that our intended manufacturing process will undergo modifications, primarily based on initial manufacturing results and data generated during the manufacture of drug substance and product to be used in our clinical trials. Modifications could cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval of SM-88, if at all, as well increase our research and development and manufacturing costs and potentially make such product costs prohibitive to our intended end users and their medical insurance providers.
 SM-88 is currently administered with the conditioning agents methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus. Methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus each previously received regulatory approval in areas other than cancer treatment. SM-88 and the three agents within MPS are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and we do not believe unusual equipment would be required in the manufacturing process.
 Our tyrosine-based component is a derivative product that has been modified by a proprietary process to modify its functionality. This drug substance is being manufactured on an exclusive basis by a leading, FDA-audited contract manufacturer that has previously manufactured tyrosine-based products on a commercial scale. This manufacturer currently is our sole supplier of this drug substance. To our knowledge, the current manufacturer of this drug substance is the only FDA-approved supplier of this drug. We believe this cGMP contract manufacturer has sufficient capacity to meet our projected needs into the near future and we maintain inventory on hand to meet our immediate clinical needs. In the event of a catastrophic event or if this contract manufacturer is unable to meet our needs, we will need to find an alternative source. This will likely result in delays for the clinical development program or future commercial programs. It is not impossible to find a substitute for this supplier in the event that it becomes necessary, but it may be costly, including in terms of development time. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant supply of the drug substance.
 To date, we have, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer, produced cGMP drug substance for use in our planned clinical trials. In addition, we have produced cGMP clinical trial materials utilizing such drug substance, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer. Such newly produced drug substance and clinical trial materials are currently undergoing long term regulatory testing. We believe we have produced enough drug substance to create an inventory to meet our immediate needs regarding our planned clinical trials.
 For future work involving the drug product, it is anticipated that manufacture process development work will continue, focusing on manufacturing improvements, and increasing scale. It is anticipated that future manufacturing of clinical trial materials may be required to fill clinical trial needs. Additional tyrosine derivative drug product variations have also been developed for research purposes and some are being validated and tested for clinical purposes.
 23


The three APIs for MPS are available from several contract manufacturers, each holding Drug Master Files at the FDA for their respective APIs. We believe that the loss of or the inability of any single source to provide our required ingredients would not have any substantive delaying effect on our research program, clinical trials or future commercial sale of SM-88, as we believe other sources are readily available.
 TYME has started a development program focused on a new potential treatment of COVID-19, TYME-19. The Company is assessing manufacturing and clinical and service options for the TYME-19 development program.Employees and Human CapitalAs of March 31, 2021, we had a total of 17 employees, all full-time and all located in the United States. Of this total workforce, eight employees were engaged in or directly supported our research and development activities and nine perform general and administrative functions. The roles of certain employees, including our Chief Science Officer, Steve Hoffman, include both R&D activities and general administrative functions, and, as such, for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence they are categorized in more than one role based on time spent on each function. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. In order to enable us to further develop and potentially commercialize SM-88 and other pipeline candidates we will need to maintain and continue to hire additional experienced personnel as well as to rely on third-party consultants for certain activities. 

 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others. We have also historically offered our employees the ability to work remotely as well as in our office and expect to continue to do so in the future. These benefits provide our employees choices where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families, as well as access to tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors to improve their physical and mental health.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and “shelter in place” and similar orders issued by state and local governments, we restricted access to our New Jersey office, as well as suspended any non-essential business travel. Since March 2020, our employees have conducted their work remotely, and they otherwise have had minimal presence in our office for essential activities. The safety, health and well-being of our employees is paramount. As such, we will consider ongoing government regulations and local health conditions before lifting any restrictions on travel or allowing any gatherings at our offices.

 Consultants
 Where necessary, we have entered into consulting contracts to provide us with subject matter expertise. We believe there is a sufficient number of available contractors with appropriate subject matter expertise for our current and near-term needs. We retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement. Under such agreements, we generally pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, we have in the past and may again in the future grant options to purchase our common stock to consultants, subject to the vesting requirements contained in their consulting agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer, or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us.Collaboration with Eagle Pharmaceuticals On January 7, 2020, TYME and Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eagle”) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Eagle SPA”), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Eagle 10,000,000 shares of common stock, at a price of $2.00 per share. The Eagle SPA provides that Eagle will, subject to certain conditions, make an additional payment of $20 million upon the occurrence of a milestone event, which is defined as the earlier of (i) achievement of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the TYME-88-Panc pivotal trial; or (ii) achievement of the primary

endpoint of overall survival in the PanCAN Precision Promise SM-88 registration arm; or (iii) FDA approval of SM-88 in any cancer indication. This payment would be split into a $10 million milestone cash payment and a $10 million investment in TYME at a 15% premium to the then prevailing market price. Eagle’s shares will be restricted from sale until the earlier of three months following the milestone event or the three-year anniversary of the agreement.Also, on January 7, 2020, we entered into a Co-Promotion Agreement with Eagle (the “Co-Promote”), whereby Eagle agreed to provide sales representatives to cover 25% of the Company’s sales force requirements and will receive 15% of the net sales of all SM-88 products in the U.S. during the term of the Co-Promote. TYME will also be responsible for clinical development, regulatory approval, commercial strategy, marketing, reimbursement and manufacturing of SM-88. TYME retains the remaining 85% of net U.S. revenues and reserves the right to repurchase Eagle’s rights under the Co-Promote for $200 million.

Exchange Agreements
 
On May 20, 2020, the Company entered into exchange agreements with holders (the “Holders”) of the April 2019 Warrants. The April 2019 Warrants were offered and issued pursuant to the Company’s previous shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-211489).

Pursuant to exchange agreements (the “Share Exchange Agreements”) with Holders of April 2019 Warrants to purchase 5,833,333 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,406,250 shares of Common stock (the “Exchange Shares”) in exchange for such April 2019 Warrants. Concurrently therewith, each such Holder executed and delivered to the Company a leak-out agreement  (a “Share Leak-Out Agreement”) that contains trading restrictions with respect to the Exchange Shares, which (i) for the first 90 days, prohibit any sales of Exchange Shares, (ii) for the subsequent 90 days, limit sales of Exchange Shares on any day to 2.5% of that day’s trading volume of Common Stock, and (iii) prohibit new short positions or short sales on Common Stock for the combined 180 day period.

The Company also entered into an exchange agreement (the “Warrant Exchange Agreement”) with another Holder of April 2019 Warrants to purchase 2,166,667 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate.  Pursuant to the Warrant Exchange Agreement, the Company issued such Holder a new warrant (the “May 2020 Warrant”) to purchase the same number of shares of Common Stock. The May 2020 Warrant has the same expiration date, April 2, 2024, as the April 2019 Warrants, but has an exercise price of $1.80 and does not include the price protection, anti-dilution provisions or other restrictions on Company action from the April 2019 Warrants. Concurrently therewith, such Holder executed and delivered to the Company a leak-out agreement that contains trading restrictions on sales of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the May 2020 Warrant that are substantially similar to the restrictions on Exchange Shares in the Share Leak-Out Agreement, provided that the leak-out restrictions will only apply to the first 893,750 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the May 2020 Warrant.
