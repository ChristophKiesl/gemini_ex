Item 1. | Business

Our Company
Avaya is a global leader in digital communications products, solutions and services for businesses of all sizes delivering most of its technology through software and services. We enable organizations around the globe to succeed by creating intelligent communications experiences for our clients, their employees and their customers. Avaya builds open, converged and innovative solutions to enhance and simplify communications and collaboration in the cloud, on-premise or a hybrid of both. Our global, experienced team of professionals delivers award-winning services from initial planning and design, to seamless implementation and integration, to ongoing managed operations, optimization, training and support.
Businesses are built by the experiences they provide, and everyday Avaya delivers millions of those experiences globally through its software and solutions. Avaya is shaping the future of businesses and workplaces, with innovation and partnerships that deliver significant, tangible business results. Our cloud communications solutions and multi-cloud software ecosystem power tailored, intelligent, and effortless customer and employee experiences that enable our clients to effectively engage and interact with their customers.
During fiscal 2020, Avaya shifted its entire comprehensive portfolio of capabilities to Avaya OneCloud, which offers significant capabilities across contact center, unified communications and collaboration, and communications platform as a service (“CPaaS”). We believe Avaya OneCloud uniquely positions us to address a customer’s needs in creating a Digital Workplace for their campus-based and remote employees through Unified Communications and Collaboration and the Customer Experience Center, our name for contact centers, helping clients deliver tangible business results.
Avaya offers a range of sales and licensing models that can be deployed on-premise or via a public, private, or hybrid cloud. During fiscal 2020, our investments to transform our revenue generation model from one that was legacy on-premise to one that is cloud-facing began positively contributing to our financial performance. Avaya offers an open, extensible development platform, enabling customers and third parties to easily create custom applications and automated workflows for their unique needs, integrating Avaya’s capabilities into the customer's existing infrastructure and business applications. Our solutions enable a seamless communications experience that adapts to how employees work instead of changing how they work.
Avaya also offers one of the broadest portfolios of business devices in the industry, including handsets, video conferencing units and headsets to meet the needs of every type of worker across a customer’s organization and help them get the most out of their communications investments. Avaya IP-enabled handsets, multimedia devices and conferencing systems enhance collaboration and productivity, and position organizations to incorporate future technological advancements. 
Operating Segments
Our business has two operating segments: Products & Solutions and Services.
Products & Solutions
Products & Solutions encompasses our unified communications and contact center software platforms, applications and devices.
•Unified Communications and Collaboration ("UCC"): Avaya's UCC solutions enable organizations to reimagine collaborative work environments and help companies increase employee productivity, improve customer service and reduce costs. With Avaya's UCC solutions, organizations can provide their workers with a single application, or “app,” for all-channel calling, messaging, meetings and team collaboration with the same ease of use as existing consumer apps. Avaya embeds communications directly into the apps, browsers and devices employees use every day giving them a more natural, efficient and flexible way to connect, engage, respond and share - where and how they want. During fiscal 2020, we expanded our UCC portfolio to include cloud-based solutions.
•Contact Center ("CC"): Avaya’s industry-leading digital contact center solutions enable clients to build a customized portfolio of applications to drive stronger customer engagement and higher customer lifetime value. Our reliable, secure and scalable communications solutions include voice, email, chat, social media, video, performance management and third-party integration that can improve customer service and help companies compete more effectively. Like the UCC business, Avaya is evolving CC solutions for cloud deployment and, in fiscal 2020, we expanded our CC portfolio to include cloud-based solutions.
•We are also focused on ensuring an outstanding experience for mobile callers by integrating transformative technologies, including Artificial Intelligence ("AI"), mobility, big data analytics and cybersecurity into our CC solutions. As our customers use these solutions to gain a deeper understanding of their customer needs, we believe that their teams become more efficient and effective and, as a result, their customer loyalty grows.
Services
Complementing our product and solutions portfolio is a global, award-winning services portfolio, delivered by Avaya and our extensive partner ecosystem. Our services portfolio consists of our global support services, enterprise cloud and managed services and professional services. We also classify customers who upgrade and acquire new technology through our subscription offerings as part of our Services segment.
•Global Support Services provide offerings that help businesses protect their technology investments and address the risk of system outages. We help our customers gain a competitive edge through proactive problem prevention, rapid resolution and continual solution optimization. Most of our global support services revenue is recurring in nature. 
•Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services enable customers to take advantage of our technology via the cloud, on-premise, or a hybrid of both, depending on the solution and the needs of the customer. Most of our enterprise cloud and managed services revenue is recurring in nature and based on multi-year services contracts.
•Professional Services enable our customers to take full advantage of their IT and communications solution investments to drive measurable business results. Our experienced consultants and engineers partner with customers along each step of the solution lifecycle to deliver services that add value and drive business transformation. Most of our professional services revenue is non-recurring in nature.
With these comprehensive services, customers can leverage communications technology to help them maximize their business results. We help our customers use communications to minimize the risk of outages, drive employee productivity and deliver a differentiated customer experience.
Our services teams also help our customers transition at their desired pace to next generation communications technology solutions. Our customers can choose the level of support for their communications solutions best suited for their needs, which may include deployment, training, monitoring, solution management, optimization and more. Our systems and service team’s performance monitoring can quickly identify and address issues before they arise. Remote diagnostics and resolutions focus on fixing existing problems and avoiding potential issues in order to help our customers save time and reduce the risk of an outage.
Avaya OneCloud Deployment Options and Capabilities 
Cloud and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) models generally refer to the products and services that allow organizations to move from owning, managing and running solutions to paying only for the capabilities they need. Avaya OneCloud provides an option for customers to access all of this and customize as they see fit.
Avaya OneCloud provides the full spectrum of deployment options, including via private, public and hybrid cloud, as well as on-premise. This enables organizations to deploy our solutions in the way that best serves their business requirements and complements their existing investments, while moving with the speed and agility they require. 
Avaya OneCloud, delivered as Private, Public, Hybrid or On-Premise
•Private cloud: Each organization has its own instance of the software, although the platform is shared across multiple organizations.
•Public cloud: Each organization has a tenant of a shared instance of the software on a shared platform.
•Hybrid cloud: In a hybrid deployment, customers are able to leverage private cloud features that are already performing to their specifications and then integrate newly developed capabilities from the broader public cloud portfolio.
Avaya’s solutions are addressing the convergence of private and public cloud deployments observed across the industry. Used in conjunction with our private cloud solution, a customer can use a public cloud to provide capability at the edge of their network in a cost effective manner. Avaya’s investments in data-driven intelligent automation mean that if an organization needs to deploy an advanced, integrated, value-focused solution via a private cloud but needs it deployed in just hours, Avaya can deliver such a solution on the requested timeline. The benefit to the organization is “always available” access to the latest capabilities and innovation, quickly and at scale.
Avaya OneCloud, delivered as Subscription
Subscription begins the customer’s journey to the cloud by changing the commercial model from an ownership model with an existing on-premise solution to a usage model, with monthly or annual subscription payments. The customer only pays for the software and solutions that they need as opposed to buying an off the shelf solution that cannot be easily tailored to their needs, while providing access to the latest software.
Avaya OneCloud, delivered as a Managed Service
An organization can leverage its existing technology infrastructure investments without having to operate them. In this model, the organization will transition from a commercial model to a usage model and engage Avaya or a business partner to operate its investments on their behalf. The customer receives a tailored solution using the latest software with standardized cloud contracts.
Avaya OneCloud Migration
We believe our migration methodology differentiates us from many other cloud vendors in the market because of our range of services and ability to seamlessly migrate our customers to the cloud. We provide a range of cloud-facing deployment options best suited to a customer’s business and the capabilities to help our customers deploy these options. Our approach also provides flexible options based on standardized methodologies, a range of services, enterprise software expertise and tools to help organizations along every step of their journey to the cloud, by reducing transition complexities and risks as they move from their current deployment to a cloud-based one. 
With our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio and a long-term technology development roadmap in place, we are helping our customers build state-of-the-art digital workplaces and contact centers. Our customers can take advantage of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions at any stage in their journey, and leverage new capabilities and innovations from Avaya and its ever-expanding partner ecosystem by consuming these software capabilities from the cloud, over-the-top of their on-premise solutions.
On-Premise 
While a growing portion of our business is transitioning to our private, public and hybrid cloud-facing consumption models, there are customers that have business models and/ or requirements that mandate a premise-based infrastructure and therefore we will continue to support such solutions.
Application Developer Products
Along with off-the-shelf integrations with frequently used business applications used across an organization, Avaya’s unified communications platform simplifies the embedding of Avaya One Cloud communications and collaboration capabilities into business applications, including customer relationship management and enterprise resources planning. Our platform enables customers, third parties to work with Avaya to create customized engagement applications and to meet the unique operating requirements of a customer with unified communications and contact center capabilities including voice, video, messaging and meetings. Avaya also offers a cloud-based execution and test environment for developing proof-of-concept applications.
Avaya Client SDK provides a developer-friendly set of tools that enables the building of innovative user experiences for vertical or business specific applications. Any functionality Avaya uses in its own clients and applications is available to developers through the SDK. Developers can mix and match functionality from both our unified communications and contact center solutions.
Avaya has an extensive developer program boasting over one million active developers. Avaya DevConnect enables third parties to support and extend the capabilities of Avaya solutions to address business challenges. Thousands of companies around the world are program members, including developers, system integrators, service providers and Avaya customers.
Cloud, Alliance Partner and Subscription Revenues (“CAPS”) 
We measure our success in transforming our business to the cloud and our ability to reduce our dependence on premise-based perpetual licensing models by analyzing the contribution of our “CAPS revenue” to total consolidated revenue. CAPS revenue refers to revenue from cloud based solutions, together with revenues from our Strategic Alliance Partnerships and Subscription revenue. Our CAPS revenue as a percentage of total consolidated revenue, excluding the impact of fresh start accounting adjustments recognized upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy, has grown over the past three fiscal years, representing 26%, 15% and 14% of total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Alliances and Partnerships 
Avaya has formed commercial and partnering arrangements through global alliances to expand the availability of our products and services, enhance the value derived by customers and grow our revenue opportunity. 
Global Alliances
Avaya global alliances are strategically oriented technical and commercial relationships with key partners that we believe enhance both companies' go-to-market strategy. We have three primary types of global alliances: Global Service Provider alliances, Global Systems Integrator alliances and Ecosystem alliances.
•Global Service Provider alliances: Through these partnering arrangements with leading telecommunications service providers, we pursue sell-to and sell-through opportunities for Avaya solutions and services. These alliances are integral in selling and implementing our cloud-based services. We also see them as a principal route to market for our UCaaS and CCaaS solutions. During fiscal 2020, we entered a strategic partnership with RingCentral, Inc. (“RingCentral") and began deployment of Avaya Cloud Office, our OneCloud UCaaS solution.
•Global Systems Integrator alliances: These are similar to our Global Service Provider alliances, but refer to arrangements with systems integrator partners, as well as key channel partners with strong professional services and systems integration capabilities.
•Ecosystem alliances: These partnering arrangements are with industry leaders and leading technology companies. They feature deeper, R&D-led integrations and/or expanded go-to-market efforts, such as the DevConnect Select Product Program or the Avaya & Friends Program for international markets. 
Channel Partners
Our channel partners serve our customers worldwide through Avaya Edge, our business partner program. Through certifications, the Avaya Edge program positions Value Added Reseller partners to sell, implement and maintain our communications systems, applications and services. Avaya Edge offers clearly defined partner categories with financial, technical, sales and marketing benefits that grow with levels of certification and revenue contribution. We support partners in the program by providing our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio of solutions in addition to sales, marketing and technical support. Although the terms of individual channel partner agreements may deviate from our standard program terms, our standard program agreements for resellers generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms. Agreements may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 30-days' prior notice, and our standard program agreements for distributors may generally be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days prior notice. Certain of our contractual agreements with our largest distributors and resellers, however, permit termination of the relationship by either party for convenience upon prior notice of 180 days. Our partner agreements generally provide for responsibilities, conduct, order and delivery, pricing and payment, and include customary indemnification, warranty and other similar provisions. The Company's largest distributor, ScanSource Inc., is also its largest customer and represented 8% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2020. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-Our strategy depends in part on our reliance on our indirect sales channel" for additional information on the Company's reliance on its indirect sales channel.
Our Business Today
Our solutions address the needs of a diverse range of businesses, including large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, hospitality, education, government, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications. We employ a flexible go-to-market strategy with direct or indirect presence in approximately 190 countries. As of September 30, 2020, we had more than 4,000 active channel partners and for fiscal 2020 our product revenue from indirect sales through our channel partners represented 67% of our total Products & Solutions segment revenue.
For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 (on a combined basis), we generated revenue of $2,873 million, $2,887 million and $2,851 million, of which 37%, 42% and 44% was generated by Products & Solutions and 63%, 58% and 56% by Services, respectively. Revenue by business area is presented in the following table for the periods indicated:

(1) Upon our emergence from bankruptcy on December 15, 2017, we adopted fresh start accounting, which resulted in a new basis of accounting and the Company became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. For additional information on the effects of adopting fresh start accounting, see “Emergence from Bankruptcy” below.
One of our key focuses is increasing our recurring revenue. We define recurring revenue as revenue from products and services that are delivered pursuant to multi-period contracts including recurring subscription-based software revenue, maintenance, global support services and enterprise cloud and managed services. Non-recurring revenue consists of hardware, non-recurring perpetual-based software and one-time professional services. Hardware predominantly consists of endpoints, which include phones, video conferencing equipment and headsets. Non-recurring software is predominantly comprised of perpetual licenses. One-time professional services include installation services, as well as project-based deployment, design and optimization services. 
Trends Shaping Our Industry
We believe several trends are shaping our industry, creating a substantial opportunity for us and other market participants to capitalize on these trends. These trends include:
•Unified Communications and Collaboration, CPaaS and Contact Center are converging to become part of an integrated services offering delivering next-generation communications capabilities across a host of devices and channels. Avaya already has more than 10,000 customers that range in size from 10 seats to 250,000 seats on a converged premise-based UCC and CC platform.
•Businesses will continue to invest in more than one unified communications platform as they build a collaboration portfolio to be used by their employees to address use cases specific to their ability to service their end customers.
•Remote worker and workforce mobility requirements are growing as the needs to work from home, or from anywhere, accelerate—driving increased usage of mobile devices by consumers and employees. These trends are further amplified as business leaders shift IT priorities to digitally transform their companies and take advantage of disruptive technologies like cloud-based solutions and delivery models, big data, IoT, cybersecurity and AI.
•Preference for cloud delivery of applications and management of multiple and varied devices continues to grow, all of which must be handled with the security their business demands. 
•Demand for multi-experience as an evolution of omnichannel customer service continues to become an increasingly critical element of contact center solutions as consumers embrace new technologies and devices in creative ways.
•The Experience Economy will drive decision making in the future. These experience expectations mean that communications in serving the customer are continuing to become an increasingly critical element in contact center solutions, as consumers embrace new technologies and devices in creative ways and at an accelerating pace. Avaya is continuing to invest in AI-derived solutions delivered through cloud and subscription models to create “Experiences that Matter” for customers, employees and agents. This increased adoption and deployment of AI is providing significant new opportunities for enhanced UCC and CC solutions that improve the customer experience and transform the Digital Workplace. By expanding the use of AI, we can potentially reduce adoption costs, increase solution effectiveness and offer expanded alternatives to traditional methods for rendered services. 
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that these trends create significant market opportunity for the next-generation UCaaS, Collaboration, CCaaS and CPaaS solutions that Avaya has brought to the market in fiscal 2020. The limitations of traditional premise-based communications solutions and services and capital-intensive buying models present an opportunity for differentiated vendors to gain market share in the cloud. We believe that the total available market for these solutions includes spending on communications applications, and the business devices that improve the application experience, as well as spending on one-time and recurring professional, enterprise cloud and managed services, and support services to implement, maintain and manage these solutions. 
We are expanding our business in several of these areas, primarily with cloud-facing and subscription-based consumption models for customers, as well as providing them with managed services offerings. We are also growing in the customer segments that we serve, including large enterprises with more than 1,000 employees, as well as midmarket enterprises with between 50 and 250 agents in the contact center market and between 100 and 1,000 employees for customers using our UCC solutions. The growth opportunity in these markets comes from the need for enterprises to increase productivity and upgrade their unified communications and collaboration and contact center strategy to a more integrated approach, to account for the accelerated work from home / work from anywhere trend, increased mobility, and a host of devices and multiple communications channels. In response to these needs, we expect that aggregate total spending on UCC, CPaaS, CC, services and support, and enterprise cloud and managed services to grow, with the majority of growth coming from cloud services.
Although the decision makers for our solutions and services have traditionally been senior IT leadership, up to and including Chief Information Officers (“CIOs”), our research finds that now more of the buying decisions are being influenced by business units and the broader C-suite, including Chief Executive Officers (“CEOs”), Chief Marketing Officers (“CMOs”) and Chief Digital Officers (“CDOs”). They have become more involved as digital transformation has expanded beyond the data center and IT infrastructure to encompass lines of business operations and customer experiences. CEOs, CMOs and CDOs are recognizing growing customer and employee demand for better interactions across multiple channels of their choosing, and they see an opportunity to differentiate their companies and lines of business by providing their employees with an opportunity to deliver a superior customer experience. 
We believe that due to the increasing importance of technology as both an internal and external-facing presence of the enterprise, as well as the high stakes of data breaches, CEOs are increasingly engaged in the decision-making process. CMOs and CDOs are gaining additional budget authority as they are tasked with managing customer experience and marketing activities using sophisticated communications technology and rich data. We believe that because of the shifts in decision-making roles, the focus of customer experience solutions should be to provide businesses with better ways to engage with end users securely across multiple platforms and channels, creating better customer experiences, and ultimately, higher revenues for the business. 
In our experience, decision makers have three critical priorities:
•Shift to cloud-based solutions: Companies today seek technology that helps them lower Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”) and increase deployment speed and application agility, including a variety of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions. They are also shifting away from a complex, proprietary capital-intensive consumption model to one that is more flexible and efficient in gaining access to the latest technology.
•Leverage existing technology infrastructure while positioning for the future: The speed at which new technology enters the market is challenging companies to rapidly adopt and install new technology. We believe this pressure creates strong demand for scalable systems that do not require enterprise-wide overhauls of existing technology to implement newer solutions and technologies. Instead, it favors incremental, flexible, extensible technologies that are easy to adopt and compatible with, existing infrastructures.
•Manage the reliable and secure integration of an increasing number and variety of devices and endpoints: Today, business users leverage laptops, smartphones and tablets just as often – if not more than – desk-based devices. The ability to communicate seamlessly and securely across devices, applications and endpoints must be managed as part of an integrated communications infrastructure.
Our Answer
Position Avaya as the leader in cloud-based Digital Workplace and Customer Experience Solutions. To accomplish this, we plan to:
•Define innovation in our core market segments by delivering powerful AI-enabled cloud communications solutions,
•Win with global services capabilities that support customer cloud adoption and drive expansion, and
•Activate, convert and transform our installed base by providing a customer journey that enables them to effortlessly migrate to, and consume Avaya cloud services.
In addition, Avaya intends to:
•Increase our Midmarket Capabilities and Market Share: We believe our market opportunity for the portion of the midmarket segment that Avaya serves is growing. We define the midmarket as firms with between 50 and 250 agents for CC and between 100 and 1,000 employees for UCC. Not only do we believe this segment is growing, but we also believe midmarket businesses are underserved and willing to invest in IT enhancements. We intend to continue to invest in our midmarket offerings and go-to-market resources to increase market share and meet the growing demands of this segment.
•Increase Sales to Existing Customers and Pursue New Customers: We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our sales to our existing customers by offering new solutions from our Avaya OneCloud portfolio. This set of cloud capabilities is supported by our market leadership, global scale and extensive customer interaction, including at the C-suite level, and creates a strong platform from which to drive and shape the evolution of enterprise communications. Our track record with our customers has earned us credibility that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in helping them cope with this evolution. 
We also believe our refreshed product and services portfolio provides increased potential for acquiring new customers.
We have worked to become both HIPAA and PCI DSS compliant as we believe the ability to service these two areas will significantly expand our potential customer base and total addressable market. These certifications allow for market penetration into otherwise restrictive and difficult markets, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
•Invest in Sales and Distribution Capabilities: Our flexible go-to-market strategy consists of both a direct sales force and indirect sales through our alliances and channel partners, allowing us to reach customers across industries and around the globe. We believe our channel partner network is a valuable competitive differentiator. We intend to continue investing in our channel partners and sales force in order to optimize their market focus and enter new vertical segments. We provide our channel partners, including master agents and sales agents, with training, marketing programs and technical support through our Avaya Edge program that helps to further differentiate our offerings. These agents are our primary distribution channel for small to midmarket customers. Under our master agent program, small to midmarket sales agents connect potential customers with us and we then handle the rest of the transaction including contracting, provisioning, managing and billing the Avaya services for the business. The master agent program provides an option that rounds out the available choices for customers, channel partners and sales agents to access Avaya’s industry-leading communications solutions.
We also leverage our sales and distribution channels to accelerate customer adoption of our cloud-based solutions and generate an increasing percentage of our revenue from our new high-value software products, video collaboration, midmarket offerings and user experience applications.
•Expand Margins and Profitability: We maintain a tight focus on profitability levels and are continually evaluating the efficacy of our cost-saving initiatives. These initiatives have contributed to improvements in our gross margin and we expect to pursue additional cost-reduction opportunities. While we anticipate margin and profitability growth to increase over the long-term as a result of these cost-saving initiatives, we expect slight decreases in margin during fiscal 2021 as we invest in our new Avaya OneCloud offerings.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on the opportunities created by the market trends affecting our industry.
A Leading Position across our Primary Markets
With a full suite of UCC and CC solutions offered under Avaya OneCloud and our expansive go-to-market capability, we are a leader in business communications. We maintain a leading market share in worldwide contact center agents and are among the leaders in unified communications and collaboration seats. We were recognized as a Leader in the Aragon Research Globe for Unified Communications and Collaboration and Aragon Research Globe for Unified Communications and Collaboration 2020 reports. Additionally, we believe that we are a leading provider of private cloud and managed services and that our market leadership and incumbent position within our customer base provides us with a superior opportunity to cross-sell to existing customers and position ourselves to win over new customers. 
Our Open Standards Technology Supports Multi-vendor, Multi-platform Environments
Our open, standards-based technology is designed to accommodate customers with multi-vendor environments seeking to leverage existing investments. Providing enterprises with strong integration capabilities allows them to take advantage of new UCC and CC technology as it is introduced. It does not limit customers to a single vendor or add to the backlog of integration work. We also continue to invest in our developer ecosystem, Avaya DevConnect, which has grown to include more than 119,000 members as of September 30, 2020. Avaya DevConnect, together with our Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs"), which are a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications and applications development environments, allow our customers to derive unique and additional value from our architecture.
Building on our Leading Service Capabilities for a Significant Recurring Revenue Stream
Avaya services relationships have long been significant contributors to our large recurring revenue base, and provide us with significant visibility into our customers’ future collaboration needs. Our global support services and enterprise cloud and managed services are typically provided to customers through recurring contracts. These contracts generally have terms that range from one- to five-years for support services, and one- to seven-years terms for enterprise cloud and managed services. The launch of our Avaya OneCloud Subscription offer is a further evolution of our global support services business and provides our customers with flexibility in how they consume our solutions. 
In addition to insights into their ongoing operational needs, our professional services team engages in migration planning, security services, custom application integration and other consulting activities that position us to understand our customers’ business needs today and in the future.
•Support Services: Avaya is a leading provider of recurring support services for business communications solutions. Our worldwide services-delivery infrastructure and capabilities help customers address critical business communications needs from initial planning and design through implementation, maintenance and day-to-day operation, monitoring and solution management. With more than 4,000 trained and certified services professionals worldwide, we can help customers find and implement the right communications solutions.
We believe the Avaya support services team continues to be well-positioned for success due to our close collaboration between our R&D and service planning teams in advance of new product releases. We offer high levels of automation to onboard and manage a customer’s communications infrastructure, delivering faster, more effective deployments from proof of concept to production. This includes a robust communications automation platform with full event orchestration leveraging advanced AI functionality. As a pioneer of the omnichannel support experience in enterprise support, Avaya also gives customers the option to interact with our "Ava" virtual agent, to access immediate support answers online. Customers can also connect with one of our experts via web chat, web talk or web video. When necessary, Avaya Services can also directly access our R&D teams to resolve customer issues. All combined, these capabilities position Avaya to provide the highest-quality service for Avaya products.
•Professional Services: Avaya offers a broad portfolio of capabilities through its professional services, including implementation/enablement services, system optimization, innovation services, partner solution integration and custom applications development.
•Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services: With a focus on customer performance and growth, Avaya’s enterprise cloud solutions and managed services solutions range from managing software releases, to operating customer cloud, premise or hybrid-based communication systems, to helping customers migrate to next-generation business communications environments. We believe that our deep understanding of application management supporting unified communications, collaboration and contact center solutions positions us to best manage and operate cloud-based communications systems for our customers.
We believe our employees and consultants are among the best in our industry because they are trained and supported by the best in the industry. The high level of customer satisfaction ratings we receive for support transactions is a testament to the expertise of our people. These dedicated professionals are focused on satisfying customer needs, driving a proactive and preventive agenda to help customers maintain optimum levels of service.
We continue to broaden the options for cloud-based service offerings, expanding our consulting services capabilities and upselling our existing customers to our cloud-based and managed services offerings. We are investing to provide additional options along the spectrum of support service offerings, constantly developing our tools and infrastructure to improve our service levels. In addition, as our custom applications development team complete customer-funded application development engagements, they identify opportunities to monetize those solutions across our broader customer base.
Expanding Cloud Offerings and Capabilities
In our experience, technology and business leaders are increasingly turning to cloud-based technologies and business models that help enterprises cut costs, increase productivity, simplify IT environments and shift, when possible, to subscription-based models. We are investing in the expansion of our cloud and hybrid cloud solutions and through our Avaya OneCloud portfolio, offer solutions and technologies that span on-premise, private, public and hybrid cloud development models. Avaya Cloud Office, launched in fiscal 2020, will position us to further meet market demand for cloud-based unified communications and collaboration applications, while the launch of our next-generation CCaaS offering will support customer demand in contact center applications.
Open Standards, Product Differentiation and Innovation
Avaya’s open architecture provides a competitive advantage for us as potential customers consider migrating to our solutions and services because we can integrate with incumbent competitor systems and provide a path for gradual transition, while immediately achieving overall cost savings and improved functionality.
Throughout fiscal 2020, we enhanced our Avaya OneCloud portfolio by rolling out new solutions to address growing demand for our CCaaS, CPaaS, UCaaS and Subscription offerings, as customers transition to cloud-based and subscription consumption models to support public, private and hybrid cloud or on-premise deployments. 
We expect to continue investing in innovation across the portfolio to bring further enhancements and breakthroughs to market, encouraging customers to continue to add innovative new capabilities to their systems. As we expand our cloud and mobility opportunities, we are also identifying new ways to leverage virtual desktop infrastructure to securely deliver business communications to users. We are developing AI solutions internally and with partners to help organizations transform customer experiences. We are deploying these disruptive solutions to drive incremental value for our customers, and their customers.
Research and Development ("R&D")
Avaya makes substantial investments in R&D to develop new systems, solutions and software in support of business communications, including, but not limited to, converged communications systems, communications applications, multimedia contact center innovations, collaboration tools, messaging applications, video, speech-enabled applications, business infrastructure and architecture, converged mobility systems, cloud offerings, web services, artificial intelligence, communications-enabled business processes and applications, and services for our customers. Over the past three fiscal years, we have invested approximately $780 million in R&D, including technology acquisitions.
We invested 19.3%, 16.7% and 16.9% in R&D as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reflecting a consistent investment in R&D as a percentage of product revenue and evidencing our commitment to innovation. Our investments in fiscal 2020 focused on driving innovative cloud solutions across our portfolio and new releases of our UCC and CC solutions.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of patents important to our business and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our R&D investments in new products and services across all areas of our business. As of September 30, 2020, we had more than 4,400 patents and pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. These patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of products and services involving a variety of technologies. For the U.S., patents terms may be 20 years from the date of the patent's filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so both organically, through commercial relationships, and in connection with acquisitions.
We manage our patent portfolio to maximize return on investment by selectively selling patents at market prices and cross licensing with other parties when such sales or licensing are in best our interests. These monetization programs are conducted in a manner that helps to preserve Avaya’s freedom to operate and to help ensure that Avaya retains patents needed for defensive use.
From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us, and certain pending claims are in various stages of litigation. Based on our experience and customary industry practice, we believe that any licenses or other rights that might be necessary for us to continue with our current business could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Intellectual Property and Information Security-We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services."
Customers
Avaya employs a flexible, go-to-market strategy to support our diverse customer base, ranging in size from small businesses employing a few employees to large government agencies and multinational companies with more than 100,000 employees. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications, hospitality, health care, education and government. Our customers include leading Forbes Global 2000 companies across all these industries. For more information concerning the risks related to contracts with the U.S. federal government, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-Contracting with government entities can be complex, expensive and time-consuming."
Sales and Distribution
Our global go-to-market strategy is designed to focus and strengthen our reach and impact on large multinational enterprises, midmarket and regional enterprises and small businesses. Our go-to-market strategy is intended to serve our customers in the way they prefer to work with us, either directly with Avaya or indirectly through our sales channel, which includes our global network of strategic alliances, channel partners, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, telecommunications service providers, system integrators, master agents and sub-agents. Our sales organizations are equipped to sell our comprehensive Avaya OneCloud portfolio complemented by services offerings including product support, integration and other professional services, and enterprise cloud and managed services.
We continue to focus on efficient deployment of Avaya sales resources, both directly and indirectly through our channel partners, for maximum market penetration and global growth. Our investment in our sales organization includes fully integrated curricula on the sales process, guided selling, sales enablement and our solutions for all roles within our sales organization.
Seasonal trends impact the sale of our products. Typically, our second fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure-In addition to experiencing some seasonal trends, our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have historically fluctuated and the results of one period may not provide a reliable indicator of our future performance." 
Development Partnerships
The Avaya DevConnect program is designed to promote the development, compliance-testing and co-marketing of innovative third-party products that are compatible with Avaya’s standards-based products. Member organizations have expertise in a broad range of technologies, including IP telephony, contact center and unified communications and collaboration applications.
As of September 30, 2020, over 32,000 companies have registered with the program, including over 280 companies operating at higher program levels, eligible for technical support and to submit their products or services for compatibility testing through the program by the Avaya Solution Interoperability and Test Lab ("Avaya Test Lab"). Avaya DevConnect engineers work in concert with each submitting member company to develop comprehensive test plans for each application to validate the product integrations.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers produce the vast majority of our products in facilities located in southern China, with other products manufactured in facilities located in Mexico, Taiwan, Germany, Ireland and the U.S. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs, furnished or approved by Avaya, and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components from third-party Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), which we then resell separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand.
In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited number of suppliers. Delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations, although we have not yet had any such event have a material impact on us. We have also outsourced substantially all our warehousing and distribution logistics operations to several providers of such services on a global basis, and any delays or material changes in such services could cause significant disruption to our operations, although many alternative suppliers are active in the market today. For more information on risks related to products, components and logistics, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed."
The Company has not experienced any material impacts from the tariffs levied by the U.S. Government on goods manufactured in China and sold into U.S. markets.
Competition
Although we believe we are differentiated from any single competitor, the following represent the Company's primary competitors in various lines of our business:
•Enterprise UCC: Cisco, Microsoft, NEC, Atos Unify, Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise and Huawei.
•Midmarket UCC: Mitel, NEC, Cisco and Microsoft.
•Cloud Products and Services: Cisco, Microsoft, RingCentral, 8x8, Mitel, Google, LogMeIn, Fuze, Zoom and Twilio.
•Video Products and Solutions: Cisco, Microsoft, Zoom, LogMeIn, Google, Poly, Huawei, ZTE, Ring Central, BlueJeans, and LifeSize.
•Enterprise Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Aspect Software, Huawei, NEC and Enghouse Interactive.
•Midmarket Contact Center Products and Services: Genesys, Cisco, Five9, NICE InContact, Amazon, Twilio, Talkdesk and Vonage.
We also face competition in certain geographies with companies that have a particular strength and focus in these regions, such as Huawei in China and Intelbras in Latin America. 
While we believe our global, in-house end-to-end services organization as well as our indirect channel provide us with a competitive advantage, we face competition from companies offering products and services directly or indirectly through their channel partners, as well as resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and network service providers.
For more information on risks related to our competition, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition- We face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth."
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of September 30, 2020, we had 8,266 employees with 2,774 located in the U.S. and 5,492 located outside the U.S. There were 7,941 employees not represented by unions or similar organizations and 325 that were represented and covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the 325 full-time employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, 310 were located in the U.S. Over recent years, we have assembled a new senior management team that is action-oriented with a disruptive mindset and the willingness to move the business forward to achieve our objectives. 
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring our human capital management, including, among other aspects, management depth and strength assessment, leadership development, talent assessment, diversity, equality and inclusion and our employee survey results. While human capital management is overseen at the highest level of our Company, it is woven into the everyday fabric of Avaya’s culture. 
At Avaya, our people – and the richness of their ethnicities, perspectives, experiences and skills - are the driving force behind our every success. We established cultural principles that are the foundation of our success and put these into action by living our cultural principles in everything we do. Our cultural principles are: simplicity, accountability, teamwork, trust and empowerment. These cultural principles serve as the framework in which we hire, train and manage and assess the performance our global employee population. We believe these principles help differentiate us and, in part, allowed us to retain 96.4% of our top-rated employees throughout fiscal 2020. This represents a 2.1 point increase year over year. 
As part of Avaya’s overall dedication and investment in its employees and consistent with its people first strategy, we conduct employee engagement surveys. The surveys in each of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 focused on a variety of different areas, including employee trust in the leadership, effectiveness of leadership communication, and personal and professional employee development. As a result of our transition to a largely work from home workforce in response to global efforts to contain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our engagement survey in fiscal 2020 focused on remote working, including topics such as the employees’ continued effectiveness in a remote environment, access to the necessary resources to be successful in their roles, continued customer focus in a virtual environment and gauging our employees’ health and wellbeing. Avaya intends to continue to monitor engagement through different surveys. 
Lastly, Avaya continues to strive to make diversity, equality and inclusion a priority. As of September 30, 2020, 22% of the global employee headcount was female and 26% of our employees in the United States self-identified as part of a minority group. For additional information on the workplace elements of Avaya’s Corporate Responsibility Program see “--Corporate Responsibility and Culture at Avaya.”
Corporate Responsibility and Culture at Avaya
Creating experiences that matter not only defines how Avaya does business, but how we aspire to impact the world. The Avaya OneCloud portfolio of communications solutions contributes to environmental sustainability, supporting remote working initiatives through unified communications solutions such as video, collaboration and team rooms. Our company and our associates also drive positive change by taking action and building partnerships to address pressing environmental and community issues as part of our commitment to Corporate Responsibility. We are leveraging sustainability as an opportunity for innovation, such as developing new initiatives to eliminate single-use plastics in our operations and supply chain. Our employees, customers, partners and suppliers continue to make meaningful and lasting differences in the world, including donating their time and money to support charities and non-profit organizations worldwide. And we are advancing awareness of diversity and inclusion by engaging in dialogue with our employees and leaders.
Avaya’s Corporate Responsibility Program incorporates four key elements: Environment, Community, Marketplace and Workplace. For the Environment element, Avaya looks to implement environmental stewardship practices at our global locations. Community represents Avaya working to positively impact society and supporting the communities where we are located. Marketplace includes engaging in fair and ethical business dealings with our customers, our partners and our supply chain. Workplace focuses on developing a desirable place to work for our employees across the globe.
•With 8,266 global employees, diversity, inclusion and equity have been fundamental to Avaya’s core values. Avaya is a member of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion program to work toward a more inclusive and progressive workplace that values differences and evolves understanding and is also a signatory to the statement from the Silicon Valley Leadership Group standing up for racial justice and equality. This statement is available on www.avaya.com. Information on our website is not a part of this report.
•Avaya has also made a commitment to a newly established Avaya Diversity & Inclusion Council. This council, which is to be created by Avaya employees, aims to build a workplace where individuality is celebrated and harnessed, creating a culture of engagement, innovation and inclusivity. 
•Avaya has also created new employee resource groups, including the WIN@A (Women Inspired Network @ Avaya) group focused on women, and ABLE (Avaya Blacks Leading Empowerment) and is also creating new groups for Veterans, LGBTQ employees, Hispanics/Latinos and other employee-defined priority groups. 
•These Company-sponsored groups provide the global Avaya team with an opportunity to share open dialogue around issues, promote a culture of Diversity and Inclusion, and provide new business and audience insights into the Company’s diverse customer base.
•Avaya conducts unconscious bias training for all employees. This is not a new program, but has been accelerated to allow for more timely discussions and a greater sense of urgency. 
•The Company’s Talent Acquisition program has led to steady year-over-year increases in female and minority representation in leadership positions across Avaya, and the team is currently implementing a series of new tools and practices to further increase diversity in the Company’s candidate pools for hiring and advancement. 
The Company has taken an employee-first view of diversity and inclusion, and employees are encouraged to support each other and Avaya communities in light of recent events. We are closely tracking progress on these key items, while exploring other initiatives, from corporate social responsibility, to investments in non-profit organizations, to supporting employee efforts and supporting the global communities where Avaya employees live and work.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Avaya is subject to a wide range of governmental requirements relating to safety, health and environmental protection, including:
•certain provisions of environmental laws governing the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination;
•various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the material content and electrical design of our products that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products; and
•various employee safety and health regulations that are imposed in various countries within which we operate. 
We are currently involved in a few remediations at currently or formerly owned or leased sites, which we do not believe will have a material impact on our business or results of operations. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Global Operations and Regulations-We may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, costs and other liabilities" for a discussion of the potential impact such governmental requirements and climate change risks may have on our business.
Cybersecurity
Avaya has a vigorous, risk-based cybersecurity program, dedicated to protecting our data as well as data belonging to our customers and partners. We utilize a defensive in-depth strategy, with multiple layers of security controls to protect our data and solutions. Organizationally, we have a Product Security Council, cross-functional Cyber Incident Response teams, Security Operations Centers, and strong governance to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. These teams are comprised of experts across our enterprise, as well as outside experts, to ensure that we are monitoring the effectiveness of our cybersecurity governance and vulnerability management programs.
For more information on risks related to data security, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Intellectual Property and Information Security- A breach of the security of our information systems, products or services or of the information systems of our third-party providers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition."

Emergence from Bankruptcy
On January 19, 2017 (the "Petition Date"), Avaya Holdings Corp., together with certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Debtors"), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the "Bankruptcy Filing") under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). On November 28, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization filed by the Debtors on October 24, 2017 (the "Plan of Reorganization"). On December 15, 2017 (the "Emergence Date"), the Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.
Beginning on the Emergence Date, the Company applied fresh start accounting, which resulted in a new basis of accounting and the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting and the effects of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization, the Consolidated Financial Statements after December 15, 2017 are not comparable with the Consolidated Financial Statements on or prior to that date. Our financial results for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 are referred to as those of the "Predecessor" period. Our financial results for the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018 are referred to as those of the "Successor" period or periods. Our results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements for these periods are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 and the period from December 16, 2017 through September 30, 2018 separately, we have in certain instances in this report presented operating results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods because such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods.
For a more detailed discussion of our bankruptcy proceedings (the "Restructuring"), see Part II, Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Part II, Item 8, Note 24, "Fresh Start Accounting," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
