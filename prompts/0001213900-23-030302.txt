Corporate History and Structure



We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Cardigant Medical Inc. on April 17, 2009. Our initial business plan was focused on the development of novel biologic and peptide-based compounds and enhanced methods for local delivery of treatments for vascular diseases including peripheral artery disease and ischemic stroke.



Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of July 31, 2014, Yong Li, an individual purchased a total of 22,185,230 (pre- Reverse Stock Split) restricted shares of common stock of the Company from a group of three former shareholders of the Company. In consideration for the shares, Mr. Li paid the sellers $399,344 in cash which came from his own capital. The sellers were Jerett A. Creed, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, director and formerly a controlling shareholder of the Company, the Creed Family Limited Partnership and Ralph Sinibaldi. The shares represented approximately 95% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding common stock. The sale was consummated on August 28, 2014. As a result of the transaction, there was a change in control of the Company.



On August 27, 2014, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with Cardigant Neurovascular. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, we assigned all our assets, properties, rights, title and interest used or held for use by our business, (except for certain excluded assets set forth therein) which was the treatment of atherosclerosis and plaque stabilization in both the coronary and peripheral vasculature using systemic and local delivery of large molecule therapeutics and peptide mimetics based on high density lipoprotein targets (“Cardigant Business”). In consideration for such contribution of capital, Cardigant Neurovascular agreed to assume all our liabilities raising from the Cardigant Business prior to the date of the Contribution Agreement and thereafter with regard to certain contributed contacts. We granted Cardigant Neurovascular an exclusive option for a period of 6 months to purchase the excluded assets for $1. Cardigant Neurovascular exercised this option October 20, 2014 and the excluded assets were assigned to Cardigant Neurovascular on October 20, 2014.



Also on October 20, 2014, we acquired the business of Hong Kong Takung through the acquisition of all the share capital of Hong Kong Takung under a Share Exchange Agreement dated September 23, 2014 in exchange for 209,976,000 (pre-Reverse Stock Split) newly-issued restricted shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Hong Kong Takung.



Hong Kong Takung is a limited liability company incorporated on September 17, 2012 under the laws of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China. Although Hong Kong Takung was incorporated in late 2012, it did not commence business operations until late 2013.



As a result of the transfer of the excluded assets pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Hong Kong Takung, we ceased the Cardigant Business and assumed Hong Kong Takung’s business operations.



On November 5, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of the State of Delaware to change our name from “Cardigant Medical Inc.” to “Takung Art Co., Ltd.”



On July 28, 2015, Hong Kong Takung incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Takung (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.

On January 27, 2016, Hong Kong Takung incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Takung Cultural Development (Tianjin) Co., Ltd (“Tianjin Takung”) in the Tianjin Free Trade Zone (TJFTZ) in Tianjin, China with a registered capital of $1 million. Tianjin Takung provides technology development services to Hong Kong Takung and Shanghai Takung, and also carries out marketing and promotion activities in mainland China. On May 8, 2020, Shanghai Takung was deregistered and its operations were merged with Tianjin Takung in order to save administrative costs. During 2021, Hong Kong Takung lost its control over the operation of Tianjin Takung and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Tianjin Takung was deconsolidated.



On August 10, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-25 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Upon filing of the Certificate of Amendment, every twenty-five shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Shareholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to rounding up their fractional shares to the nearest whole number.

Recent Regulatory Developments




We and our subsidiaries are not based in mainland China and do not have operations in mainland China. We currently do not have or intend to set up any subsidiary in mainland China, or do not foresee the need to enter into any contractual arrangements with a VIE to establish a VIE structure in mainland China.     Pursuant to the Basic Law, which is a national law of the PRC and the constitutional document for Hong Kong, national laws of the PRC shall not be applied in Hong Kong except for those listed in Annex III of the Basic Law and applied locally by promulgation or local legislation. The Basic Law expressly provides that the national laws of the PRC which may be listed in Annex III of the Basic Law shall be confined to those relating to defense and foreign affairs as well as other matters outside the autonomy of Hong Kong. The basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong as a special administrative region of the PRC are reflected in the Basic Law, providing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy and executive, legislative and independent judicial powers, including that of final adjudication under the principle of “one country, two systems”.



However, in light of the PRC government’s recent expansion of authority in Hong Kong, we may be subject to uncertainty about any future actions of the PRC government or authorities in Hong Kong, and it is possible that all the legal and operational risks associated with being based in and having operations in the PRC may also apply to operations in Hong Kong in the future. There is no assurance that there will not be any changes in the economic, political and legal environment in Hong Kong. The PRC government may intervene or influence our current and future operations in Hong Kong at any time, or may exert more control over overseas offerings and listing and/or foreign investment in issuers like ourselves. Such governmental actions, if and when occur: (i) could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue our operations; (ii) could significantly limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our common stock to investors; and (iii) may cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or be worthless.



We are also aware that, recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in certain areas in mainland China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over mainland-China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. For example, on July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Strictly and Lawfully Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities to crack down on illegal activities in the securities market and promote the high-quality development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over mainland-China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws.



On December 28, 2021, the CAC and other PRC authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which took effect on February 15, 2022. In addition, the Cybersecurity Law, which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on November 7, 2016 and came into force on June 1, 2017, and the Cybersecurity Review Measures, or the “Review Measures”, provide that personal information and important data collected and generated by a critical information infrastructure operator in the course of its operations in mainland China must be stored in mainland China, and if a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services that affect or may affect national security, it should be subject to national security review by the CAC together with competent departments of the State Council. In addition, for critical information infrastructure operators, or the “CIIOs”, that purchase network-related products and services, the CIIOs shall declare any network-related product or service that affects or may affect national security to the Office of Cybersecurity Review of the CAC for cybersecurity review. Due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact scope of what constitutes a “CIIO” remains unclear. Further, the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws. In addition, the Review Measures stipulates that any online platform operators holding more than one million users/users’ individual information shall be subject to cybersecurity review before listing abroad. As of the date of this annual, neither we nor our subsidiaries received any notice from any authorities identifying us or our subsidiaries as a CIIO or requiring us or our subsidiaries to undertake a cybersecurity review by the CAC. Further, as of the date of this annual report, neither we nor our subsidiaries have been subject to any penalties, fines, suspensions, investigations from any competent authorities for violation of the regulations or policies that have been issued by the CAC.

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law requires that data shall not be collected by theft or other illegal means, and it also provides for a data classification and hierarchical protection system. The data classification and hierarchical protection system protects data according to its importance in economic and social development, and the damages it may cause to national security, public interests, or the legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations if the data is falsified, damaged, disclosed, illegally obtained or illegally used, which protection system is expected to be built by the state for data security in the near future. On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Regulations on the Data Security Administration Draft, or the “Data Security Regulations Draft”, to solicit public opinion and comments. Under the Data Security Regulations Draft, an overseas initial public offering to be conducted by a data processor processing the personal information of more than one million individuals shall apply for a cybersecurity review. Data processor means an individual or organization that independently makes decisions on the purpose and manner of processing in data processing activities, and data processing activities refers to activities such as the collection, retention, use, processing, transmission, provision, disclosure, or deletion of data. Our Hong Kong subsidiary, Metaverse HK may collect and store certain data (including certain personal information) from our clients who may be PRC individuals. We do not currently expect the Review Measures to have an impact on our business, operations or this offering as we do not believe that Metaverse HK is deemed to be a “CIIO” or a “data processor” controlling personal information of no less than one million users, that are required to file for cybersecurity review for overseas listing, because (i) Metaverse HK is incorporated and operating in Hong Kong without any subsidiary or VIE structure in mainland China and the Review Measures remains unclear whether it shall be applied to a Hong Kong company; (ii) as of the date of this annual report, Metaverse HK did not collect or store any personal information of individual clients of mainland China; and (iii) as of the date of this annual report, Metaverse HK has not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it file for a cybersecurity review.    Based on laws and regulations currently in effect in the PRC as of the date of this annual report, we believe our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not required to pass the cybersecurity review of the CAC in order to list our common stock in the U.S.



In addition, on February 17, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the “Trial Measures,” and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, shall complete filing procedures with the CSRC pursuant to the requirements of the Trial Measures within three working days following its submission of initial public offerings or listing application. If a domestic company fails to complete required filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject to administrative penalties, such as an order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines. According to the Notice on the Administrative Arrangements for the Filing of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies from the CSRC, or “the CSRC Notice,” the domestic companies that have already been listed overseas before the effective date of the Trial Measures (namely, March 31, 2023) shall be deemed as existing issuers (the “Existing Issuers”). Existing Issuers are not required to complete the filing procedures immediately, and they shall be required to file with the CSRC for any subsequent offerings. Based on laws and regulations currently in effect in the PRC as of the date of this annual report, we believe our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not required to obtain regulatory approval from the CSRC in order to list our shares of common stock in the U.S.

Dividend Policy and Cash Transfers



Metaverse HK is permitted under the laws of Hong Kong to provide funding to NFT Exchange, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in Wyoming, through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. We and our subsidiaries currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.   Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments.



Our management has determined to dispose Hong Kong Takung together with Hong Kong MQ and its subsidiary, Tianjin Takung. After the completion of the disposition, Metaverse HK will be the only subsidiary in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the PRC and the basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong are reflected in the Basic Law, providing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy and executive, legislative and independent judicial powers, including that of final adjudication under the principle of “one country, two systems”. The laws and regulations of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from Metaverse HK to NFT Exchange or from Metaverse HK to the Company and the investors in the U.S.



According to the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong, a Hong Kong company may only make a distribution out of profits available for distribution or other distributable reserves. Dividends cannot be paid out from share capital.



There are no restrictions or limitation under the laws of Hong Kong imposed on the conversion of HKD into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of Hong Kong.




Our Trading Platform



Our proprietary platform is an all-electronic trading system, consisting of host computers, client-side terminals and an interconnected communication system. Our trading system supports the trading and payment/settlement of artwork ownership units. It is an electronic platform developed by a third-party software development company and customized for us, primarily consisting of a matching system, a transaction monitoring system, an account managing system and a settlement system.



Matching is a core function of our trading platform. Our system concludes transactions by matching all the transactions submitted by the Traders (as defined below). Transaction monitoring system is responsible for monitoring the daily transactions in real-time to ensure fairness and accuracy in our trading platform. The settlement system verifies and reconciles daily statistical data with the banks’ transaction system, and completes the registration and settlement (or payment) of artwork units once the transaction data is verified.

Our website https://www.nftoeo.com/ is an essential part of our trading platform.



The website is important as it is the gateway to our trading platform. It publishes our membership and trading rules, trading information disclosure, and artwork introduction, and provides services to Traders, such as account management. Traders may open, close and manage their accounts with us on our website. Client-end terminal may be downloaded from our website. Through the terminal, Traders may access their account with us and conduct transactions in artwork units, such as purchasing and selling and submitting inquiries. Data transmission between the Traders and our trading system is encrypted to prevent data leaks.



In order to execute a trade, a Trader logs into his online bank account and must first transfer funds from his bank account to his trading account with us. This ensures that he has sufficient funds to consummate a trade.



Offering and trading of artwork on our platform involves a number of parties, namely, Original Owner, Offering Agent, and Traders.




● | An Original Owner is the original owner of the artwork to be offered and traded on our platform. Customarily, the Original Owner is also the artist or creator of the artwork although this is not always the case. The Original Owner must have good and marketable title to the artwork and have the right to dispose of the artwork.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An Offering Agent is an entity that is experienced with artwork or artwork investment and has a good reputation. The Offering Agent is engaged by the Original Owner to assist him or her with the offering and trading of artwork, such as preparation of listing application and assigning an investment value, research, organizing promotions and marketing activities, communicating with potential investors, etc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Trader is anyone who is 18 years or older or any entity that maintains a trading account with us through our electronic trading platform and participates in the trading of artwork units. Once a Trader acquires one or more units of an artwork, the Trader becomes a Co-Owner of that artwork. Presently, only residents of the People’s Republic of China, Australia, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan are eligible to become a Trader.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Additional parties such as insurer, appraisal firm, trader service organizations and custodian for artworks will be retained in connection with the offering and trading of artwork on our system. A trader service organization is an independent legal entity pre-approved by us to provide business consulting services to our Traders.



Our trading system hardware platform is hosted by a rendered service from Amazon web and their server is in Singapore. Our clearing system hardware platform is hosted in Hong Kong and our disaster recovery system is set up in the CITIC Telecom IDC room, located in Hong Kong. The real-time data synchronization ensures the safety of transaction data.



Revenue



We generate revenue from our services in connection with the offering and trading of artwork on our system. Our revenue mainly falls into three broad categories: (i) listing fees, (ii) trading commissions, and (iii) management fees. To a much smaller extent, we have two additional sources of revenue, which we began earning start in 2015. We charge an annual fee for providing Traders and Offering Agents with premium services, including more in-depth information and tools, on the trading platform. This revenue is recognized ratably over the service agreement period. We also began earning authorized agent subscription revenue which is an annual service fee paid by authorized agents to grant them the right to bring their network of artwork owners to list their artwork on our trading platform. This revenue is recognized ratably over the annual agreement period.

Sales and Marketing



The Company has a professional marketing team. After the platform is launched, it can be promoted online and offline simultaneously, so as to quickly increase its popularity, and use professional marketing solutions to attract more creators and purchasers to join the platform.



We expect that we will generate revenue from the offering and trading of NFT on our system, primarily consisting of membership fee, trading commissions, and advertising fees.



Customers



Our customers are the Traders, Original Owners and Offering Agents. We are constantly marketing and increasing our customer base, it is difficult to ascertain if the loss of a single customer, or a few customers would have a material adverse effect on us. Suffice it to say, no one customer constitutes in the aggregate 10% or more of our consolidated revenue.
Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had 22 full-time employees. As for the 22 employees, 1 is General Manager, 3 are from administrative department, 5 are from financial department, 5 are from technical department, 5 are from operation department, and 3 are from marketing department.




There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.



Regulation



U.S. Regulations



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”) was enacted by the U.S. government which included a wide range of tax reform affecting businesses including the corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, tax credits and deduction with majority of the tax provision effective after December 31, 2017.



The Act establishes a flat corporate income tax rate of 21% which supersedes the current tax rate ranging from 15% through 35% and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) effective in 2018.



Under the Act, U.S. federal net operating losses (NOLs) carryforwards will be carried forward indefinitely while the two-year NOL carrybacks for NOLs arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 was repealed. Furthermore, the Act imposes an annual limit of 80% on the amount of the taxable income that such NOLs can offset for the NOLs arising in taxable years ending December 31, 2019 and thereafter.





8







The Act has significantly modified the U.S. international business tax regime, essentially transforming the framework by which U.S. and non-U.S. headquartered businesses are taxed. The significant changes consist of:




● | A partial participation exemption system for profits derived by US-based multinationals from foreign subsidiaries, eliminating the friction of a US tax upon repatriation of overseas profits 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A minimum tax on foreign earnings of US-based multinationals with foreign subsidiaries 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A base erosion tax on transactions between US and non-US affiliated corporations, in structures involving US and non-US headquartered groups 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A one-time tax on the estimated US$2-3 trillion of overseas earnings accumulated by US-based multinationals, payable over eight years, and thus allowing those profits to be repatriated without further US tax 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Several other changes across the US international tax regime addressing the source of income, FTCs, deductibility of payments, and other issues, including ownership and transfers of intangible property (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income or GILTI). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security Act (“the CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act temporarily eliminates the 80% taxable income limitation (as enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) for net operation loss (“NOL”) deductions for 2018-2020 tax years and reinstated NOL carrybacks for the 2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also temporarily increases the business interest deduction limitations from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable year. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies qualified improvement property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus depreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively as if it was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements as of December 31, 2020 due to the recent enactment.



Corporate tax rate: The corporate tax rate remains at a flat rate of 21% for 2022 and onwards. There were no changes to the corporate tax rate in recent years.



Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): The corporate AMT was repealed in 2018 with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and there have been no recent changes to this policy.



Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit: The R&D tax credit has been made permanent and was not changed in recent years. However, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal of 2021 proposed some changes to the R&D tax credit, such as making it more accessible for small businesses.

In August 2022, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 (Public Law No. 117-169), which includes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with financial accounting profits over 1 billion US dollars (USD) and a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks.



Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT): BEAT was implemented in 2018 and there have been no significant changes in recent years. However, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal of 2021 proposed to increase the rate of BEAT to 15%.

Hong Kong Regulations



As a business operating in Hong Kong, we are subject to various regulations and rules promulgated by the Hong Kong government. The following is a brief summary of the Hong Kong laws and regulations that currently materially affect our business. This section does not purport to be a comprehensive summary of all present and proposed regulations and legislation relating to the industries in which we operate.
Securities & Futures



The securities and futures markets in Hong Kong are currently governed by the Securities & Futures Ordinance (“SFO”). The SFO consolidates and authorized the 10 previous ordinances regulating the securities and futures markets. The primary legislation and the subsidiary legislation commenced operation on April 1, 2003. By law, any person carrying on, among others, a business of dealing in securities in Hong Kong, has to be licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) unless falling within one of the licensing exemptions.



The term “securities” under the SFO is defined as:




(a) | shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes of, or issued by, or which it is reasonably foreseeable will be issued by, a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or a government or municipal government authority;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | rights, options or interests (whether described as units or otherwise) in, or in respect of, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






10








(c) | certificates of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificates for, receipts for, or warrants to subscribe for or purchase, such shares, stocks, debentures, loan stocks, funds, bonds or notes;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | interests, rights or property, whether in the form of an instrument or otherwise, commonly known as securities;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | interests, rights or property, whether in the form of an instrument or otherwise, prescribed by notice under section 392 as being regarded as securities in accordance with the terms of the notice.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our business model does not qualify as dealing in securities, as such term is defined in the SFO and as such, we are not required to obtain the requisite license from the SFC.



Sale of Goods



In the event an artwork is “delisted” from our platform, we would arrange to sell the artwork on behalf of all owners of the artwork and then distribute the proceeds of sale to them. We will be considered a “Commercial Agent” under the Hong Kong Factors Ordinance and a “Seller” under the Hong Kong Sales of Goods Ordinance.



The Sale of Goods Ordinance (“SGO”) provides that goods for sale must be:




● | Of merchantable (satisfactory) quality. Goods must meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price and all other relevant circumstances. The quality of goods includes their appearance and finish, their safety and their durability. Goods must be free from defects, even minor ones, except where these defects have been brought to your attention by the seller (section 16 of SGO); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fit for their purposes (section 16 of SGO); 
● | As described on the package or a display sign, or by the seller (section 15 of SGO); and 
● | Correspond with the sample (section 17 of SGO). 




If sellers fail to meet any one of the above conditions, they are in breach of contract. Under these circumstances, consumers are entitled to reject the goods and demand a full refund. We are accordingly bound by these implied warranties of sale in the event that we sell any artwork previously listed on our platform.



Supply of Services



We provide a platform to trade in artwork units for which we are compensated by receiving listing fees, management fees and trading commissions. The Hong Kong Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (“SSO”), provides that in the absence of provisions in the contract for services, services should be carried out with reasonable care and skill (which generally means the services must meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory) ( section 5 of the SSO), the services should be performed within a reasonable time if the time of performance has not been fixed by the contract (section 6 of the SSO); and a reasonable charge should be paid if the charge has not been fixed by the contract (section 7 of the SSO).



If service suppliers fail to meet any one of the above conditions, they would be “in breach of contract”. Under these circumstances, consumers are entitled to sue defaulting suppliers for compensation.





11







Section 8(1) of the SSO provides that as against a party to a contract for the supply of a service who deals as a consumer, the other party (the service supplier) cannot, by reference to any contract term, exclude or restrict any liability of his arising under the contract by virtue of this Ordinance. In other words, we cannot impose a contract term that excludes or restricts our liability on breach of contract.



In addition, the Hong Kong Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance subject any attempt by us to exclude our liability for financial loss or damage to property during the course of the provision of our services to the test of “reasonableness”. Our exemption clauses are also controlled by the rules of common law. For example, an exemption clause must be incorporated into the contract, and the person who is seeking to rely on the exemption clause must show that reasonable steps have been taken to bring the clause to the attention of the other party.



The Hong Kong Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance only applies to a contract for the sale of goods or supply of services in which one of the contracting parties is dealing as a consumer. If the Court finds out that the contract or any part thereof was unconscionable (unfair/not sensible) in circumstances relating to the contract at the time when it was made, the Court would have the jurisdiction under section 5 of the Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance to refuse to enforce the contract, or to enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable part, or to limit the application of, or to revise or alter, any unconscionable part so as to avoid any unconscionable result.



Fair Trading



The Trade Descriptions (Unfair Trade Practices) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012 (“Amendment Ordinance”) came into effect on July 19, 2013 and amended the Trade Descriptions Ordinance by prohibiting specified unfair trade practices that may be deployed against customers and strengthen the enforcement mechanism. The Customs and Excise Department is the principal enforcement agency under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance. Concurrent jurisdiction is conferred on the Office of the Communications Authority (“HKCA”) to enforce the new fair trading sections. The key amendments include:




● | the expansion of the definition of trade descriptions in relation to goods, as well as the extension of the scope to cover services; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the creation of new criminal offences on unfair trade practices, namely misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices, bait advertising, bait-and-switch and wrongly accepting payment; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the introduction of a compliance-based mechanism under which civil enforcement options, namely the acceptance of undertaking from Traders and the seeking of injunction from the court where necessary, can be drawn on to promote compliance with the new fair trading sections introduced by the Amendment Ordinance; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the creation of a new private right of action for damages to facilitate consumer redress. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On July 15, 2013, the Customs and Excise Department and the HKCA published the Enforcement Guidelines for the Amendment Ordinance to state the manner in which they will exercise their enforcement powers and provide guidance on the operation of the new legislative provisions.



Intellectual Property



Our business is dependent on a combination of trademarks, trademark application, trade secrets and industry know-how, and copyright, in order to protect our intellectual property rights. We have submitted trademark applications for “Takung” in Hong Kong, mainland China, Macau and the United States.



In China, the Trademark Law and the Unfair Competition Law governs our marks. The Hong Kong SAR’s trade mark registration system is separate from the system operating in other parts of China. Trade mark registrations obtained in Chinese Trade Marks Office, or elsewhere in the world, do not automatically get protection in the Hong Kong SAR. Trade marks must be registered in the Hong Kong SAR before they can be protected in the Hong Kong SAR under the Trade Marks Ordinance.

Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) of Hong Kong), or the PDPO



The PDPO imposes a statutory duty on data users to comply with the requirements of the six data protection principles (the “Data Protection Principles”) contained in Schedule 1 to the PDPO. The PDPO provides that a data user shall not do an act, or engage in a practice, that contravenes a Data Protection Principle unless the act or practice, as the case may be, is required or permitted under the PDPO. The six Data Protection Principles are:

● | Principle 1—purpose and manner of collection of personal data; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
● | Principle 2—accuracy and duration of retention of personal data;
● | Principle 3—use of personal data; 
● | Principle 4—security of personal data; 
● | Principle 5—information to be generally available; and 
● | Principle 6—access to personal data. 




Non-compliance with a Data Protection Principle may lead to a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (the “Privacy Commissioner”). The Privacy Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice to direct the data user to remedy the contravention and/ or instigate prosecution actions. A data user who contravenes an enforcement notice commits an offense which may lead to a fine and imprisonment.



The PDPO also gives data subjects certain rights, inter alia:




● | the right to be informed by a data user whether the data user holds personal data of which the individual is the data subject;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | if the if the data user holds such data, to be supplied with a copy of such data; and 
● | the right to request correction of any data they consider to be inaccurate. 




The PDPO criminalizes, including but not limited to, the misuse or inappropriate use of personal data in direct marketing activities, non-compliance with a data access request and the unauthorized disclosure of the right to request correction of any data they consider to be inaccurate.

Employment



Some of our employees are employed in Hong Kong and we are subject to the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance (“EO”). The EO is the main employment legislation in Hong Kong. It guarantees certain minimum benefits, including:

● | Paid annual leave. 
--+--------------------------
● | Paid sick leave. 
● | Paid maternity leave. 




Subject to limited exceptions, the EO applies to all employees working in Hong Kong, regardless of their nationality. Observing the terms of the EO is generally considered to be mandatory, although it is not specifically expressed to be an overriding statute.



Other mandatory laws that are likely to apply to the employment relationship with our employees include:




● | Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO). This ordinance regulates an employer’s collection or surveillance, use and disclosure of an employee’s personal data (including personal data contained in e-mails and phone calls). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance (MPFSO). Subject to very limited exceptions, this ordinance requires employers in Hong Kong to enroll employees in a Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Scheme (that is, a retirement scheme), to which the employer and employee must make certain contributions. Foreign nationals are exempt if they are posted in Hong Kong to work for a period not exceeding 13 months or belong to a retirement scheme outside of Hong Kong. In certain cases, a Hong Kong national working outside of Hong Kong may still be subject to this ordinance if the employment has sufficient connection with Hong Kong. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (OSHO). This ordinance imposes a duty on all employers, as far as is reasonably practical, to ensure the safety and health in the workplace of its employees. The OSHO covers most industrial and non-industrial workplaces in Hong Kong. 
● | Employees’ Compensation Ordinance (ECO). If an employee suffers injury arising out of and in the course of employment in Hong Kong (or overseas, if the travel is authorized by the employer), the employer is usually liable to compensate the employee under the ECO. Eligible family members of an employee killed in an accident at work can also be entitled to compensation. If an employer carries on business in Hong Kong, its employees are protected under the ordinance. (An employee can work outside Hong Kong but his employment contract must have been entered into in Hong Kong.) All employers must maintain valid employees’ compensation insurance policies to cover their liabilities under the ordinance and at common law. 






14









● | Companies Ordinance. Protects employees of a Hong Kong company (including a Hong Kong subsidiary of a foreign company) in relation to wages and other entitlements if the company is wound up. The employees become preferential creditors in the winding-up. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sex Discrimination Ordinance (SDO), Disability Discrimination Ordinance (DDO), Family Status Discrimination Ordinance (FSDO) and Race Discrimination Ordinance (RDO). All legislate against various forms of discrimination. 
● | Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. These safeguard certain rights of individuals, although they have limited application in the context of employment law. 
● | Labour Tribunal Ordinance. This ordinance empowers the Labour Tribunal to hear and resolve disputes relating to employment contracts as well as alleged breaches of the EO. It potentially covers disputes involving foreign nationals or Hong Kong residents working abroad. 
● | Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The POBO applies to employees, particularly to those who receive or solicit bribes from third parties (for example, an employee who receives bribes from a supplier of goods in return for placing orders with that supplier). In some cases, employees may also be subject to anti-corruption legislation in other jurisdictions. 




PRC Regulations



As of the date of this annual report, on the basis that we currently do not have any business operations in mainland China, we are not required to obtain approvals from the PRC authorities to operate our business or list on the U.S. exchanges and offer or continue to offer securities; specifically, we are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC, the CAC or any other PRC governmental authority to operate our business or to list our securities on a U.S. securities exchange or issue securities to foreign investors. The laws and regulations of mainland China do not currently have any material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and we are currently not subject to the PRC government’s direct influence or discretion over the manner in which we conduct our business activities outside of the mainland China.



Nevertheless, we are aware that recently, the PRC government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in mainland China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. It is also highly uncertain what potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operations, our ability to accept foreign investments and the listing of our common stock on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. If there is significant change to current political arrangements between mainland China and Hong Kong, the PRC government intervenes or influences operations of companies operated in Hong Kong like us, or exerts more control through change of laws and regulations over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in issuers like us, it may result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the securities we are registering for sale or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless.

Competition



Traditionally art galleries and auction houses provide a platform for owners of artworks to sell their collections. However, their trading model is substantially different from ours. We believe we do not have any direct competition due to our unique business model of trading artwork ownership units instead of the artworks. We are not aware of any other companies engaging in a similar business.
Research and Development



Currently, we do not have any research and development activity. We are still connecting third parties to explore research and development projects that will help us expand our business.
