ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel cell therapies for unmet medical needs. Our focus is to develop therapies for degenerative retinal diseases, neurological conditions associated with demyelination, and aiding the body in detecting and combating cancer. Specifically, Lineage is testing therapies to treat dry age-related macular degeneration, spinal cord injuries, and non-small cell lung cancer. Our programs are based on our proprietary cell-based therapy platform and associated development and manufacturing capabilities. From this platform, we develop and manufacture specialized, terminally or functionally differentiated human cells from established and well-characterized pluripotent cell lines. These differentiated cells are transplanted into a patient either to replace or support cells that are dysfunctional or absent due to degenerative disease or traumatic injury, or are administered as a means of helping the body mount an effective immune response to cancer.
Product Candidates & Other Programs
 
We have three allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” cell therapy programs in clinical development:
 

● | OpRegen®, a retinal pigment epithelium (“RPE”) cell replacement therapy currently in a Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial for the treatment of advanced dry age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”) with geographic atrophy (“GA”). There currently are no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for dry AMD, which accounts for approximately 85-90% of all AMD cases and is the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60.

● | OPC1, an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy currently in the long-term follow-up portion of a Phase 1/2a multicenter clinical trial for acute spinal cord injuries (“SCI”). This clinical trial has been partially funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | VAC2, an allogeneic cancer immunotherapy of antigen-presenting dendritic cells currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer. This clinical trial is being funded and conducted by Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent cancer research charity. 

 
In addition to seeking to create value for shareholders by developing product candidates and other technologies through our clinical development programs, we also seek to create value from our technologies through partnering and strategic transactions. We founded two companies that later became publicly traded companies: OncoCyte Corporation (“OncoCyte”) and AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. (“AgeX”).
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received approximately $12.6 million in gross proceeds in connection with our sale of shares of OncoCyte and AgeX. In August 2020, we also received $24.6 million from Juvenescence Limited (“Juvenescence”), representing principal and accrued interest under a promissory note we received in connection with our sale of AgeX shares to Juvenescence in August 2018.


We no longer hold any common stock in AgeX. The value of our OncoCyte holdings as of March 5, 2021, was approximately $4.2 million, based on the closing price of its common stock on that date. In this Report, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Capital Requirements—The value of our investments in public companies fluctuates based on their respective stock prices and could be negatively affected by poor business performance.”
 
Though our principal focus is on advancing our three cell therapy programs currently in clinical development, we may seek to create additional value through corporate transactions, as we have in the past, or by initiating new programs using our protocols or with new protocols and cell lines.

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading cell therapy company by developing allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” treatments that are comprised of differentiated cells derived from pluripotent cell lines, which have been directed to become specific cell types and use those cells as treatments to restore diseased or diminished functions, such as impaired vision, loss of movement and sensation, or to increase immune response to tumors. Significant near-term activities that underlie our business strategy include:

● | Presenting new and accumulated OpRegen data from the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical study on two occasions during the first and second quarters of 2021; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Completing VAC2 patient enrollment in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer by the end of the first half of 2021; 
● | Evaluating delivery improvements for our OPC1 program, which combined with our “ready-to-inject” formulation, will enable access to a greater number of clinical sites, currently ongoing and throughout 2021; 
● | Meeting with the FDA to discuss further development of the OPC1 program, including a late-stage clinical study, during the second half of 2021; 
● | Evaluating opportunities for new VAC product candidates based on manufacturing improvements and product improvements, including newly discovered tumor antigens/neoantigens, throughout 2021; and 
● | Evaluating partnership opportunities and expansion of existing external collaborations and identification of new collaborations for OpRegen, OPC1 and VAC2, currently ongoing and throughout 2021. 

Cell Therapy Technology
 
We believe we are a leader in pluripotent, cell-based asset development based on directed lineage derivation protocols and whole cell manufacturing capabilities. Pluripotent cells, which are widely published as capable of becoming any human cell type, have potential applications in many areas of medicine with large unmet patient needs, including certain age-related degenerative diseases and degenerative conditions for which there presently are no cures. We currently are focused on developing pluripotent cells into RPE cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and dendritic cells.
Pluripotent Stem Cells

Unlike pharmaceuticals that require a narrowly defined molecular target, cellular therapies are often aimed at regenerating or replacing the entire affected cell or tissue and therefore, may have broader or more suitable applicability than many traditional pharmaceutical products. Small molecules and biologic therapies that require systemic delivery into the body often have unexpected results, or side effects, that can limit their usefulness. When cell replacement is locally administered, particularly to anatomical compartments, systemic side effects are usually not the primary concern. The risk profile of cell therapy more closely resembles that of transplant medicine, focused more on whether the transplanted cells are rejected by the body and whether the cells function as expected. We currently are using our pluripotent stem cells as starting material from which we derive three separate and specific cell types, each of which are product candidates currently in clinical testing.
 
We maintain an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in the Bio Park on the campus of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility includes process development laboratories and a state-of-the-art, cGMP manufacturing facility. It is designed and equipped to enable simultaneous cGMP processes and to produce a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as developing scale suitable for commercial launch. All cGMP manufacturing processes, including cell banks and product manufacturing for our cell therapy product candidates, are conducted in this facility.
 
Cell Therapy Product Candidates 
 

OpRegen
 
OpRegen is our lead ophthalmic product candidate (currently in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial) for the treatment of advanced dry AMD with GA. AMD is a gradual, progressive, deterioration of the macula, the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear, high definition central vision. AMD affects over 30 million people worldwide and approximately 1.6 million people are diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a leading cause of vision loss in people over the age of 65 in the developed world. As the area of atrophy begins to include the fovea (the center of the macula), patients lose their central vision, making facial recognition, reading and driving difficult or impossible, and often resulting in legal blindness. The exact cause of dry AMD is unknown, but is thought to result from multiple factors, such as genetics, age and environmental effects. There are two clinical presentations of AMD, the dry form and the wet form, or neovascular form (growth of abnormal new blood vessels). Dry AMD typically advances slowly toward GA in which RPE cells and photoreceptors deteriorate over time. RPE cells support and nourish the retina by metabolizing waste by-products and producing a number of components useful for photoreceptor health and function. If the metabolic waste products accumulate, lesions known as drusen are generated. Approximately 85-90% of AMD patients suffer from dry AMD, for which there is no FDA-approved medical therapies. Dry AMD may also lead to wet AMD, a condition for which there are several FDA-approved treatments administered locally to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, but these treatments are not effective nor approved for the treatment of dry AMD. Physicians often recommend a healthy diet, exercise and/or nutritional supplements for dry AMD, but nutritional supplements have shown limited efficacy in delaying the onset of more progressive disease in longer-term studies. The schematics below show a representation of the process of drusen formation and the goal of cell replacement therapy.

Dry AMD involves the loss of retina cells, creating an area of geographic atrophy (GA), which causes impaired vision and blindness
 
We believe one of the most promising approaches to treat dry AMD is to replace the layer of damaged RPE cells with new, healthy and functional RPE cells manufactured from a well-characterized cell line. OpRegen is a cell replacement therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology in which our proprietary directed-differentiation methods convert pluripotent stem cells into nearly pure populations of RPE cells. Using this method, OpRegen is grown free of any animal products and consists of human RPE cells with high yield and purity that can be transplanted directly into the patient’s eye, where the patient’s own RPE cells are missing or dysfunctional. The OpRegen therapeutic approach is designed to replace damaged or lost RPE cells with the goal of slowing disease progression to preserve and/or restore visual function.
 

OpRegen is an injection of RPE cells delivered to the retina, to replace lost retinal cells and preserve or restore vision
 
Preclinical studies in the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model have shown that following a single subretinal injection, OpRegen as a suspension of cells rapidly organized into their natural monolayer structure and survived until the end of the study, which we believe is critical to the potential success of OpRegen in humans. Additionally, rats receiving OpRegen had objective evidence of improved optomotor tracking, indicating functional visual improvement compared to control animals.
 
OpRegen is intended to be an allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf,” product provided to retinal surgeons in an “easy-to-use” form for transplantation. We believe OpRegen could have a lasting benefit from a single administration, or once every several years. This approach differs from other investigational drugs for Dry AMD and approved agents currently marketed for wet AMD, such as Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) and Aflibercept (Eylea®), that require multiple, frequent intravitreal injections into the eye.

The patients in our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial are 50 years of age or older, whose dry AMD has advanced to the GA stage, with absence of additional concomitant ocular disorders. The eye in which the disease has progressed the most is treated, while their other eye serves as a measure of disease progression. Following injection, the patients are followed for 12 months at specified intervals to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen.
 
Following the initial 12-month period, patients are evaluated at longer intervals for up to an additional five years following administration. A secondary objective of the clinical trial is to examine the ability of transplanted OpRegen to engraft, survive, and modulate disease progression in the patients. In addition to thorough characterization of visual function, several vision tests are used to quantify stabilization or improvements in visual function. We also perform anatomical evaluation imaging to assess the restoration of the structure of the retina.
 
Interim data from the first 12 subjects in Cohorts 1-3 have been encouraging and suggest that OpRegen RPE cells are generally well-tolerated when administered by subretinal injection in these legally blind patients with large areas of GA that have encompassed the foveal area. The surgical procedures were generally well-tolerated, with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images showing absorption of the subretinal fluid in the bleb less than 48 hours after surgery and healing of the site of retinal penetration by the cannula within a few weeks. Initial findings using a variety of imaging modalities suggest presence of cells in the subretinal space, an observation consistent with, and supported by, the data from preclinical studies of OpRegen. Findings on clinical examination by different imaging modalities show potential improvements in retinal structure, which could precede visual functional improvements. Though it is not definitively known at this time whether these changes represent engraftment and survival of the transplanted cells, data from the preclinical animal studies suggest this is the most likely scenario.
 
Importantly, in this safety-focused aspect of the trial, no unexpected ocular adverse events have been observed and those events expected to occur based on the procedures involved in OpRegen administration, such as vitrectomy, have been predominately mild in severity. The majority of these subjects had pre-existing epiretinal membranes (ERMs) at the time of trial enrollment and in most cases, experienced new or worsening ERMs following the surgical procedure, which is believed to be partially attributable to the route of administration via pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and retinotomy. The majority were mild to moderate in severity, though two patients with severe ERM were successfully treated via a routine surgical procedure. These subjects are being monitored during trial follow-up. One instance of retinal detachment occurred in a patient who was legally blind prior to treatment. The event was not assigned as related to treatment, procedure or to the combination. The patient continued for a period of time in the trial following successful surgical repair but has since withdrawn due to other unrelated health issues. The independent data safety monitoring board approved moving to Cohort 4 based on the safety data from the Cohorts 1-3. Cohort 4 incorporates an additional variety of objective and subjective assessments to look for signs of potential efficacy as well as potential anatomical changes indicative of OpRegen cell function following implantation.
 
As described above, many of the adverse events (AEs) observed in subretinal procedures are likely related to the delivery technique utilized during the surgery. As previously described, in January 2019, we announced an exclusive partnership with Orbit Biomedical (now Gyroscope Therapeutics, Ltd.) to assess its FDA-cleared Orbit Subretinal Delivery System (SDS), a single-use vitrectomy-free delivery device designed to deliver products to the subretinal space for the administration of OpRegen within the ongoing clinical trial. The device allows for access to the subretinal space via a sclerotomy and suprachoroidal approach, which means that there are no openings created into the vitreous chamber. This could eliminate the possibilities of new or worsening epiretinal membranes and exacerbation or generation of a cataract, both known issues with the older standard method of delivery. We believe that the use of this device could significantly decrease the number of adverse events and improve retention and dose control of OpRegen in our clinical trials.
 
We completed enrollment in Cohorts 1-3 (12 patients) in the middle of 2018 and as previously reported, OpRegen was well tolerated with no unexpected systemic serious adverse events (SAEs) or ocular AEs. Importantly, there were several patients that exhibited improved retinal structure, reduction in drusen, alterations in the pattern of GA progression and indications of long-term survival of the OpRegen cells. We began enrollment of Cohort 4 (targeted for an additional 12 patients) shortly thereafter and treated three patients via the traditional route of administration. In 2019, we amended our clinical protocol to incorporate the Orbit SDS and our new thaw and inject formulation into our Phase 1/2a clinical trial. In February 2020, we announced that after reviewing promising preliminary data from the ongoing OpRegen Phase 1/2a clinical trial, our independent data safety monitoring board removed the protocol-mandated treatment stagger. The COVID pandemic slowed the rate of patient accrual but study enrollment was completed on November 10, 2020, with the treatment of the twelfth Cohort 4 patient, seven via the Orbit SDS and five via PPV/retinotomy. Five different surgeons at four centers successfully delivered OpRegen using the Orbit SDS and there were no unexpected AEs. Encouraging structural and clinical changes in these better vision patients, including better visual acuity and increased reading speed, are being followed and updates will be provided at major medical meetings or as findings merit.

In June 2020, we were able to report the first known example of retinal restoration following OpRegen administration in a Cohort 4 patient who was treated via the PPV/retinotomy route, with the findings confirmed by several independent reviewers. It is hypothesized that photoreceptor cells in the transition areas at the boundary of the GA are dysfunctional and dying, but not completely lost. The addition of new RPE cells may restore the microenvironment in surrounding tissue and contribute to the possibility of restoring function to existing cells that otherwise, if left untreated, would inevitably progress to further expansion of the atrophic region. Specifically, in this patient, the area of GA assessed at nine months following OpRegen treatment was approximately 25% smaller than the patient’s pre-treatment baseline. As reported in November at the 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Annual Meeting, this patient continues to show signs of a smaller area of GA and improved visual acuity. This unprecedented finding supports the view that dry AMD is not an irreversible, degenerative condition and that some portion of diseased retinal tissue may be recoverable in atrophic end-stage disease patients.
 
With enrollment complete, patients are being followed for safety and efficacy as per protocol. We plan to present OpRegen data to the FDA in the third quarter of 2021 for discussion about a subsequent, comparative clinical trial.
 
OPC1
 
OPC1 is our lead product candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury (“SCI”). SCI occurs when the spinal cord is subjected to a severe crush or contusion injury, such as that caused by a car or motorcycle accident and typically results in severe functional impairment, including limb paralysis, aberrant pain signaling, and loss of bladder and sexual function. There are approximately 18,000 new spinal cord injuries annually in the U.S. (NSCIC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2019)), and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of SCI, although methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid generally used as an anti-inflammatory drug, is sometimes prescribed on an off-label basis to reduce acute inflammation in the injured spinal cord immediately after injury. It is believed that to effect substantial benefit in treating this complex injury, multiple mechanisms of action are required, such as introduction of biologics that preserve surviving neurons and stimulate new nerve axon outgrowth, suppression of lesion formation at the injury site, generation of new blood vessels to repair the ischemic damage from injury, and myelination of the demyelinated and newly formed nerve axons. A key therapeutic target in SCI is replacement of oligodendrocytes that are selectively lost at the injury site. As the sole source of the insulating protein myelin in the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes wrap around nerve axons and allow conduction of electrical impulses throughout the central nervous system (“CNS”).
 
OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell therapy derived from our pluripotent cell technology under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions using a directed differentiation method. These cells are stored frozen until ready for use and prepared for direct administration into the injured spinal cord. Based on preclinical studies, when OPC1 is transplanted into the injured spinal cord, the cells undergo further maturation to generate a replacement population of oligodendrocytes at the injury site that are capable of remyelinating denuded and newly formed nerve axons. Prior to their maturation, the transplanted oligodendrocyte progenitor cells stimulate additional reparative processes, including promotion of neuron survival and nerve axon outgrowth, and induction of blood vessel formation in and around the injury site. In addition, OPC1 cells rapidly migrate from the injection point to the injury site where they generate a supportive tissue matrix and suppress cavitation. Cavitation is a destructive process that occurs within the spinal cord following SCI, and typically results in permanent loss of motor and sensory function. A patient with cavitation can develop a condition known as syringomyelia, which results in additional neurological and functional damage to the patient and can result in chronic pain. Based on the multiple reparative properties associated with OPC1, we believe this candidate cell therapy product is ideally suited to treat neurological conditions such as SCI and other demyelination and demyelination disorders of the CNS.
 
Under a grant for clinical development, the development of OPC1 has been supported by $14.3 million in funds from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”), from 2014 through the date of this Report. We intend to apply for additional grants from CIRM for the program’s continued development.

Prior to its acquisition, Asterias tested OPC1 in two clinical trials: a five patient Phase 1 safety trial and a 25-patient Phase 1/2a dose escalation trial, which we call the SCiStar trial. The SCiStar trial was an open-label, single-arm trial testing three sequential escalating doses of OPC1 administered at up to 20 million OPC1 cells with subacute, C-4 to C-7, motor complete (AIS-A or AIS-B) cervical SCI. These individuals have essentially lost all movement below their injury site and experience severe paralysis of the upper and lower limbs. AIS-A patients have lost all motor and sensory function below their injury site, while AIS-B patients have lost all motor function but may retain some minimal sensory function below their injury site. OPC1 was administered 21 to 42 days post-injury. Patients continue to be followed by neurological exams and imaging procedures to assess the safety and activity of the product. Enrollment was completed in December 2017 and consisted of five cohorts:
 

Cohort | Injury Type; OPC1 Dose | # of Patients 
-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------
Cohort 1 | AIS-A; 2 million OPC1 cells (low dose for safety evaluation) | 3 
Cohort 2 | AIS-A; 10 million OPC1 cells | 6 
Cohort 3 | AIS-A; 20 million OPC1 cells* | 6 
Cohort 4 | AIS-B; 10 million OPC1 cells | 6 
Cohort 5 | AIS-B; 20 million OPC1 cells* | 4 

 
* One patient from Cohort 3 and one patient from Cohort 5 were administered 10 million cells.
 
In January 2019, top-line 12-month data from the SCiStar trial were announced by Asterias, which included the following key findings:
 

● | Positive Safety Profile. Magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) scans at 12 months post-injection of OPC1 showed no evidence of adverse changes in any of the 25 patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cell Engraftment. All three patients in Cohort 1 and 21 of the 22 patients in Cohorts 2-5 had MRI scans at 12 months consistent with the formation of a tissue matrix at the injury site, which is encouraging evidence that OPC1 cells had engrafted at the injury site and helped to prevent cavitation. 
● | Improved Motor Function. At 12 months, 21 of the 22 patients who were administered either 10 million or 20 million cells of OPC1 (Cohorts 2-5) recovered at least one motor level on at least one side, and seven of the 22 patients recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side. Motor level recovery was based on the upper extremity motor score (“UEMS”), as measured by the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (“ISNCSCI”). None of these patients saw decreased motor function following administration of OPC1, and patients consistently retained the motor function recovery seen through six months or saw further motor function recovery from six to 12 months. 

 
In November 2019, we provided an update on the SCiStar trial that highlighted, among other things:
 

● | Positive Safety Profile. For the 21 SCiStar trial patients who had follow-up visits at 24 months post-injection of OPC1, MRI scans showed no evidence of adverse changes, and none of the patients had a decline in their motor function from their 12-month follow-up visit. There were no unexpected serious adverse events to date in any of these patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improved Motor Function. All 3 Cohort 1 patients continued to be stable 2-4 years out post treatment. At 24 months, five of the six Cohort 2 patients recovered at least two motor levels on at least one side, and one Cohort 2 patient recovered three motor levels, which has been maintained through that patient’s 36-month follow-up visit. Motor level recovery was based on the UEMS as measured by the ISNCSCI. 

 
In November 2020, the formal Clinical Study Report for the SCiStar study with the above supporting data was submitted to the FDA.
 
The FDA designated OPC1 as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), for the treatment of acute SCI and granted it Orphan Drug Designation, which includes the ability for increased interfacing with the FDA during clinical development, and a pathway to possible market exclusivity.

In 2019, we transferred all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of cell banks and the OPC1 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to our cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel. Improvements to the manufacturing process were completed in 2020 and include enhancements to the production process to ensure robust, controlled reproducible and commercially viable scale, and purity of OPC1. We also developed a thaw and inject formulation of OPC1 to facilitate logistics and handling at the point of care with the elimination of the dose preparation at the clinical site. An information amendment describing the new process, an improved analytical plan, and a proposed comparability plan has been filed with FDA. A meeting with the FDA is planned during the second half of 2021 to discuss our manufacturing improvements and the further development of OPC1 in SCI to best set the program up for success moving forward. Concurrently, we have announced a new partnership for the introduction of a novel delivery device for OPC1. Preliminary assessment of prototypes revealed promising compatibility with OPC1 product while simplifying the surgical procedure by providing surgeons with an instrument that is small, simple to use and would not require stopping the patient’s ventilator to perform the injection, allowing far more flexibility for accurate delivery to the injury site. We intend to complete development activities in the first half of 2021, then discuss with FDA the introduction of the new delivery device in our IND if supported by the collected data. We continue work to expand our partnerships with SCI advocacy and support organizations to support their mission to accelerate stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs and fast-track the development of the most promising stem cell technologies.
 
VAC2
 
VAC2 is our lead product candidate for the treatment of cancer. Cancer afflicts millions worldwide and is one of the largest unmet clinical needs with current treatment options providing limited efficacy and a wide range of debilitating side effects. To provide a more effective and targeted treatment, we are developing VAC2 as an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to an antigen hTERT, which is commonly expressed in cancerous cells but not in normal adult cells. VAC2, is produced by our pluripotent cell technology using a directed differentiation method, and is comprised of a population of mature dendritic cells to which the hTERT antigen was introduced. As the most potent type of antigen presenting cell in the body, dendritic cells instruct our body’s immune system to attack and eliminate harmful pathogens and unwanted cells. To target cancerous cells, VAC2 is engineered to express the tumor-selective antigen telomerase, which is found in over 85% of all cancers. The tumor antigen is loaded exogenously into the dendritic cells. The VAC1 autologous program, which preceded VAC2, serves as an effective and encouraging proof of concept behind our approach to dendritic cell vaccines targeting telomerase, which is the backbone of the VAC2 program.
 
Using pluripotent cells as the starting material for VAC2 production adds several additional advantages to this therapeutic candidate. Compared to technologies that rely on the use of a patient’s own blood, our pluripotent cell technology provides a scalable system for production of a large number of vaccine doses in a single lot, lower manufacturing costs, greater product consistency, and more notably, off-the-shelf availability to provide broader and immediate access to patients. In addition, we believe that as an allogeneic therapy, VAC2 has the potential to stimulate a more robust immune response through an adjuvant effect resulting from the partial immune mismatch between the VAC2 cells and patients receiving the therapy. We believe that VAC2 can be used as a platform technology that can be modified to carry any antigen, including patient-specific tumor neo-antigens.
 
In September 2014, Asterias initiated clinical development of VAC2 by entering into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CRUK Agreement”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited (“CRT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CRUK, under which CRUK agreed to fund Phase 1 clinical development of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2. Patient enrollment began in June 2018 and six patients have now completed dosing in the initial aspect of the trial.
 
In May 2020, Lineage and its wholly owned subsidiary Asterias entered into a Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CTOA Amendment”) with CRUK and CRT, which amends the Clinical Trial and Option Agreement entered into between Asterias, CRUK and CRT dated September 8, 2014, as amended September 8, 2014. Pursuant to the CTOA Amendment, Lineage assumed all obligations of Asterias and exercised early its option to acquire data generated in the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer being conducted by CRUK. CRUK will continue conducting the VAC2 study.

Lineage and CRT effectuated the option by simultaneously entering into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) pursuant to which Lineage agreed to pay the previously agreed signature fee of £1,250,000 (approximately $1.6 million). In consideration of Lineage’s agreement to exercise the option prior to completion of the study, the parties agreed to defer the signature fee as follows: £500,000 in September 2020, £500,000 in January 2021 and £250,000 in April 2021. For the primary licensed product for the first indication, the License Agreement provides for milestone fees of up to £8,000,000 based upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial and the filing for regulatory approval and up to £22,500,000 in sales-based milestones payments. Additional milestone fees and sales-based milestone payments would be payable for other products or indications, and mid-single-digit royalty payments are payable on sales of commercial products.
 
We completed the transfer of all cGMP manufacturing processes, including the establishment of cell banks and the VAC2 process development and manufacturing for clinical studies, to our cell therapy manufacturing facility in Jerusalem, Israel. In 2021, we will focus on updating and optimizing the manufacturing process for VAC to ensure reliable supply for future clinical studies and possible commercial development. An improved VAC manufacturing process will be the subject of a key interaction with FDA in the future to introduce VAC in an IND.
 
The allogeneic VAC2 program was preceded by the autologous VAC1 program which isolated dendritic cells from a patient’s own blood, modified those cells to stimulate immune responses to telomerase and then administered those cells back to the patient as a therapeutic modality. VAC1 was studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. A Phase 2 clinical trial of VAC1 demonstrated that it successfully manufactured and released in 24 out of the 33 patients enrolled in the trial. Twenty-one patients received VAC1 in the trial, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Asterias performed follow-up data collection on the 19 patients treated while in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival.
 
VAC1 utilized an autologous approach where the cellular vaccine needs to be created specifically for each patient. This results in a longer time prior to administration of therapy as compared to the allogeneic approach of the VAC2 program, which is disadvantageous in advanced cancer patients given the rapidity of disease progression. The VAC1 autologous program which preceded VAC2 serves as an effective and encouraging proof of concept behind our approach to dendritic cell vaccines targeting telomerase, which is the backbone of the VAC2 program.
 
Research Programs
 
Vision restoration
 
In 2017, we expanded our ophthalmology portfolio by acquiring exclusive global rights to technology that allows the generation of three-dimensional human retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent cells. This tissue contains all the cell types and layers of the human retina and has shown evidence of functional integration in proof of concept animal models for advanced retinal degeneration. The technology is being developed to potentially treat or prevent a variety of retinal degenerative diseases and injuries. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) awarded us a grant of up to $1.6 million to further develop this innovative, next generation vision restoration program for retinal diseases and injuries, which severely impact the quality of life for millions of people who have limited treatment options. In 2019, we received an additional grant of $0.7 million to continue work on this program. We completed work under this grant in 2020 and submitted final reports to the NIH.
 
In 2020, the Israeli Innovation Authority approved a budgeted grant of approximately $0.6 million for us to manufacture novel retinal implants aimed to treat patients with severe retinal impairment such as retinitis pigmentosa. We are eligible for 60% reimbursement of our costs under this grant. This program allows us to combine our knowledge in manufacturing RPE cells and photoreceptors with 3D printing technology.
 
Demyelination
 
OPC1 exhibits multiple reparative properties that may have broad applicability to neurological injury and disease, particularly as a treatment for demyelination. Past research efforts investigated the potential development of OPC1 as a candidate treatment for certain forms of ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis (“MS”), two severely debilitating conditions for which demyelination is a central component to their pathology.

To develop OPC1 as a treatment for MS, initial proof-of-concept efficacy data has been demonstrated in collaboration with Yale University using a non-human primate model of MS. Results of this study showed OPC1 engraftment that was associated with substantial remyelination of the lesioned primate spinal cord up to five months post-treatment. Subsequently, we initiated a collaboration with University of California Irvine to assess OPC1 efficacy in additional mouse models of MS that better recapitulate the autoimmune components of the disease. Preliminary results indicated that in addition to OPC1’s capacity to remyelinate the lesioned spinal cord, the cells may also help stimulate proliferation of a distinct class of immune cells known as regulatory T cells that can help reduce or eliminate autoimmunity.
 
For ischemic stroke, initial proof-of-concept efficacy data for OPC1 has been demonstrated in a collaborative study with the University of California Los Angeles using a mouse model of white matter ischemic stroke. Results of this study demonstrated that within the stroke injury site, OPC1 cells engrafted, reduced lesion formation and inflammation, and increased myelination, culminating in improved functional recovery. A second preclinical study was completed in collaboration with the University of South Florida to test two different doses of OPC1 in a rat model of ischemic subcortical and white matter stroke. Results from this study demonstrated the ability of OPC1 to impact the restoration of motor function in a rat model of white matter stroke. Further, histological assessments showed a treatment-associated reduction in stroke lesion size, including in the white matter, as well as reduced inflammation and sustained OPC1 engraftment in the injured brain.
 
While we are not actively pursuing OPC1 for MS and ischemic stroke at this time, we may use the results of these studies to seek additional funding and guide further preclinical development of OPC1 for these or other conditions of demyelination.
 
Products for Other Indications
 
We also have rights to intellectual property applicable to other indications such as for producing cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and other cell types for which development of new therapies represent significant commercial opportunities. We may elect to pursue these or other programs at any time.
Other Products
 
We also have rights to HyStem, a patented biomaterial that mimics naturally occurring extracellular matrix, the structural network of molecules surrounding cells in organs and tissues essential to cellular function and tissue structure. HyStem may be useful as a scaffold for cell replacement and retention. We sold HyStem-related assets and licensed the applicable technology in late 2019, but retained the rights for other uses, including for Renevia, our facial aesthetics product, which received a Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark in September 2019.

Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We seek to protect and rely on our proprietary cell-based therapy platform and associated development and manufacturing capabilities and derived product candidates through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our platform technologies and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. For example, in addition to protecting our proprietary rights with patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, improvements, know-how and innovation, and we take steps necessary to protect these rights, including through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and internationally. We may also file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements on our clinical products, clinical product candidates, and related technologies. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee complete or adequate protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also enter into collaborative and other similar arrangements with third parties, such as license agreements, to in-license and/or out-license intellectual property rights. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain rights to commercially valuable patents, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing any intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we assess our patents and pending applications covering our products and product candidates. If we determine that any patents or patent applications no longer provide adequate or necessary protection, we may transfer or abandon such patents and patent applications to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
 
We own or license, directly or through our subsidiaries, several patent families that include hundreds of U.S. and international patents and patent applications. We cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending applications will result in issued patents.
 
OpRegen
 
We and our subsidiary, Cell Cure, have rights to issued U.S. and international patents and pending patent applications covering OpRegen. The issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2036. The pending applications if issued, will have estimated expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2041. These U.S. and international issued patents and pending applications also include those in-licensed from Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”), the commercial arm and a wholly owned subsidiary of Hadassah Medical Organization. We also solely own pending U.S. and Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications relating to cryopreserving the cell population and then shipping it to the clinical trial site so the cells can be immediately thawed and delivered to the patient without further processing. The U.S. patent applications, and any filed international patent applications based on the PCT applications, if issued, will have estimated expiration dates in 2038.

Cell Cure was a party to two pending opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office (“EPO”) involving EP Patent Numbers 2147094 (issued 08-Oct-2014) and 2554661 (issued 19-Nov-2014), both entitled, “Stem Cell-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells”. The oral proceedings took place on March 16, 2017 and March 17, 2017, respectively. Both patents were upheld by the EPO and the patents issued as amended during the opposition proceedings. Both patents cover OpRegen until 2028.
 
OPC1
 
We have numerous U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications that are relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, including patent families acquired from Geron Corporation (“Geron”) that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem (“hES”) cells, into various neural cell types, as well as various culture and purification methods. These U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications also include those in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California. Additionally, there are four patent families with pending patent applications owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. There is also a patent family directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods for the treatment of stroke using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells which is jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California. The expiration dates of the patents and pending patent applications acquired from Geron and in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California range from 2023 to 2036. The estimated expiration dates of the four patent families with pending applications owned by us range from 2036 to 2040. The commercial success of OPC1 depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition for this product with the existing patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, undisclosed know-how and/or trade secrets, or a combination of these barriers to entry.
 
VAC1 and VAC2
 
We have numerous U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications that are relevant to dendritic cells, including patent families acquired from Geron or in-licensed from third parties that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including hES cells, into hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature and mature dendritic cells. In addition, these patent rights include a patent family with claims directed to immunogenic compositions comprising antigen-presenting dendritic cells and methods of eliciting an anti-telomerase immune response in a subject by administering to the subject such compositions. The expiration dates of the patents, and the estimated expiration dates of the pending applications, acquired from Geron or in-licensed to us range from 2022 to 2041. The commercial success of VAC1 and VAC2 products depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, undisclosed know-how and/or trade secrets, or a combination of these barriers to entry.
 
Other Patents and Patent Applications
 
We have U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications related to producing cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The expiration dates of these patents and pending patent applications range from 2020 to 2032. In addition, we have U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications related to suspension cultures and feeder-free cultures for culturing and proliferating pluripotent stem cells. The expiration dates for these patents and pending patent applications range from 2021 to 2026.
 
We also have U.S. and international issued patents and pending applications covering Renevia, include those in-licensed from the University of Utah Research Foundation (“UURF”) having expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027, and a pending patent application in Europe having an estimated expiration date of 2024. We also solely own pending U.S. and European patent applications filed in 2018 that, if issued, will have estimated expiration dates in 2038.

General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
Because patent applications are confidential until a patent is issued, we may not know if our competitors have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference/derivation proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference/derivation proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events. Accordingly, there is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid in view of third party patent applications and/or patents. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed any amounts that we may accrue on our financial statements as a reserve for contingent liabilities. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.
 
The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 55 employees, of which 20 were Lineage employees and 35 were employees of Cell Cure in Israel and of which 49 were employed on a full-time basis and six were employed on a part-time basis. Ten employees hold Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of science. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Manufacturing
 
We maintain an innovative cell therapy manufacturing facility in the Bio Park on the campus of the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. The facility includes process development laboratories and a state-of-the-art, cGMP manufacturing facility. It is designed and equipped to enable simultaneous cGMP processes and to produce a range of cell therapy products for human use in clinical trials as well as at a scale suitable for commercial launch. All cGMP manufacturing processes, including cell banks and product manufacturing for our cell therapy product candidates are conducted in this facility.
 
We obtain key components required for the manufacture of our cell therapy product candidates from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain certain key components used in the manufacture of our cell therapy product candidates.
 
Licensed Technology and Product Development Agreements
 
Lineage has obtained the right to use technology that we believe has great potential in our product development efforts, and that may be useful to other companies that are engaged in the research and development of products for human therapeutic and diagnostic use.

Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement and License Agreement with Cancer Research UK 
 
On May 6, 2020, Lineage and its wholly owned subsidiary Asterias entered into a Second Amendment to Clinical Trial and Option Agreement (the “CTOA Amendment”) with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited (“CRT”), which amends the Clinical Trial and Option Agreement entered into between Asterias, CRUK and CRT dated September 8, 2014, as amended September 8, 2014. Pursuant to the CTOA Amendment, Lineage assumed all obligations of Asterias and exercised early its option to acquire data generated in the Phase 1 clinical trial of VAC2 in non-small cell lung cancer being conducted by CRUK. CRUK is continuing to conduct the VAC2 study.
 
Lineage and CRT effectuated the option by simultaneously entering into a license agreement (the “CRT License Agreement”) pursuant to which Lineage agreed to pay the previously agreed signature fee of £1,250,000 (approximately $1.6 million). In consideration of Lineage’s agreement to exercise the option prior to completion of the study, the parties agreed to defer the signature fee as follows: £500,000 in September 2020, £500,000 in January 2021 and £250,000 in April 2021. For the primary licensed product for the first indication, the CRT License Agreement provides for milestone fees of up to £8,000,000 based upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial and the filing for regulatory approval and up to £22,500,000 in sales-based milestones payments. Additional milestone fees and sales-based milestone payments would be payable for other products or indications, and mid-single-digit royalty payments are payable on sales of commercial products.
 
Either party may terminate the CRT License Agreement for the uncured material breach of the other party. CRT may terminate the CRT License Agreement in the case of Lineage’s insolvency or if Lineage ceases all development and commercialization of all products under the CRT License Agreement.
 
Hadasit Research and License Agreement
 
In June 2017, Cell Cure entered into a Second Amended and Restated License Agreement with Hadasit (the “Hadasit License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Hadasit License Agreement, Hadasit granted Cell Cure an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license (with the right to grant sublicenses) in its intellectual property portfolio of U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications relevant to materials and technology related to human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells and RPE cells, to use, commercialize and exploit any part thereof, in any manner whatsoever in the fields of the development and exploitation of: (i) human stem cell derived photoreceptor cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders; and (ii) human stem cell derived RPE cells, solely for use in cell therapy for the diagnosis, amelioration, prevention and treatment of eye disorders. This intellectual property licensed includes patents and pending applications having expiration dates, and estimated expiration dates, respectively, ranging from 2025 to 2028. Cell Cure and Hadasit also jointly own U.S. and international issued patents and patent applications directed to methods of selecting RPE cells, which patents and patent applications will expire in 2033.
 
Pursuant to the Hadasit License Agreement, Cell Cure paid a small one-time lump sum payment for reimbursement of intellectual property related expenses and will pay a royalty in the mid-single digits of net sales from sales of licensed intellectual property by any invoicing entity and a royalty of 21.5% on sublicensing receipts. In addition, Cell Cure will pay Hadasit an annual minimal non-refundable royalty, which will become due and payable the first January 1 following the completion of services to Cell Cure by a research laboratory.
 
Cell Cure agreed to pay Hadasit non-refundable milestone payments upon the recruitment of the first patient for the first Phase 2b clinical trial, upon the enrollment of the first patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trials, upon delivery of the report for the first Phase 3 clinical trials, upon the receipt of an NDA or marketing approval in the EU, whichever is the first to occur, and upon the first commercial sale in the United States or EU, whichever is the first to occur. Such milestones, in the aggregate, may be up to $3.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, Cell Cure had not accrued any of these milestone payments.
 
The Hadasit License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of Cell Cure’s obligation to pay royalties for all licensed products, unless earlier terminated. In addition, the Hadasit License Agreement may be terminated by (i) Hadasit if, among other reasons, Cell Cure fails to continue the clinical development of the licensed intellectual property or fails to take actions to commercialize or sell the licensed intellectual property over any consecutive 12-month period, and (ii) by either party for: (a) a material breach which remains uncured following a cure period; or (b) the granting of a winding-up order in respect of the other party, or upon an order being granted against the other party for the appointment of a receiver or a liquidator in respect of a substantial portion of such other party’s assets. The Hadasit License Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations of Cell Cure.

License Agreement with University of California
 
We are party to an exclusive license agreement with The Regents of the University of California dated February 20, 2003 (the “UC License Agreement”) for U.S. and international issued patents and pending patent applications covering a method for directing the differentiation of pluripotent cells to glial-restricted progenitor cells that generate pure populations of oligodendrocytes for remyelination and treatment of spinal cord injury. Under the UC License Agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license under such patents, including the right to grant sublicenses, to create products for biological research, drug screening, and human therapy using the licensed patents. These issued patents and pending applications have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2024.
 
Under the UC License Agreement, we will pay the university a royalty of 1% from sales of products that are covered by the licensed patent rights, and a minimum annual royalty of $5,000 starting in the year in which the first sale of a product covered by any licensed patent rights occurs and continuing for the life of the applicable patent right under the agreement. Under certain conditions, we will pay the university 7.5% of any proceeds, excluding debt financing and equity investments, and certain reimbursements, that we receive from sublicensees.
 
The UC License Agreement terminates on the expiration of the last-to-expire of the university’s issued licensed patents. If no further patents covered by the UC License Agreement are issued, it will terminate in 2024. The university may terminate the UC License Agreement if we breach it, and we can terminate with 60 days’ notice.
 
WARF Agreements
 
We have rights to certain U.S and international issued patents, pending patent applications and stem cell lines with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) under a Commercial License and Option Agreement entered into between Lineage and WARF in January 2008 and a Non-Exclusive License Agreement entered into between Asterias and WARF in October 2013 (collectively, the “WARF Agreements”).
 
Under the WARF Agreements, we have a worldwide non-exclusive license under certain WARF patents and WARF-owned primate (including human) stem cell lines covered by such patents for use in internal research, and to make, use and sell products that are used as research tools and products that are discovered or developed through our internal research using such patents and stem cells. We paid upfront license fees and have agreed to additional payments upon the attainment of specified clinical development milestones, royalties on sales of commercialized products, and, subject to certain exclusions, a percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicenses that we may grant to use the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
The WARF Agreements will terminate with respect to licensed patents upon the expiration of the last licensed patent to expire and with respect to licensed cell lines until terminated by a party. We may terminate the WARF Agreements at any time with prior written notice, and WARF may terminate the WARF Agreements upon a breach. We have agreed to indemnify WARF and certain other designated affiliated entities from liability arising out of or relating to the death or injury of any person or damage to property due to the sale, marketing, use or manufacture of products that are covered by the licensed patents, licensed stem cell lines or inventions or materials developed or derived from the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
Royalty Agreement with Geron
 
In connection with Asterias’s acquisition of Geron’s stem cell assets, in October 2013, we entered into a royalty agreement with Geron (the “Royalty Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to pay Geron a 4% royalty on net sales (as defined in the Royalty Agreement) by us or any of our affiliates or sales agents of any products that we develop and commercialize that are covered by the patents Geron contributed to us. In the case of sales of such products by a person other than us or one of our affiliates or sales agents, we will be required to pay Geron 50% of all royalties and cash payments received by us or by our affiliate in respect of a product sale. Royalty payments will be subject to proration in the event that a product covered by a patent acquired from Geron is sold in combination with another product that is not covered by a patent acquired from Geron. The Royalty Agreement will terminate at the expiration or termination date of the last issued patent contributed by Geron under the Royalty Agreement. We estimate that the latest patent expiration date will be in 2032.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, safety, efficacy, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”).
 
FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologics or medical devices, depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and HCT/Ps are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Certain cell therapy proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies.
 
Our domestic human drug and biologic products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Phase 3 clinical trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the trial to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application by way of a Complete Response Letter if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications including gene therapy products (“GTPs”) to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require HCT/P establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To maintain compliance with CGMPs, GTPs, and GCPs, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies.
 
The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A drug is eligible for designation as an RMAT if: the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under certain other sections; the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Some of our current and future products may be eligible for RMAT designation.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Combination Products
 
If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. For example, our HyStem hydrogel products may be used to administer one or more pluripotent stem cell-based therapy products. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, the regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. The Office of Combination Products at the FDA coordinates the review of such products and determines the primary mode of action of a combination product. The definition and regulatory requirements for combination products may differ significantly among countries in which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. See “Manufacturing.” The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.

FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion
 
The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biologic products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA, a BLA, or an amendment to an NDA or a BLA, and must be consistent with the FDA-approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Pharmaceutical and biologic products may be promoted only for the approved indications in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Federal Funding and State Regulations
 
Effective July 7, 2009, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) adopted guidelines on the use of hES cells in federally funded research. The central focus of the guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research are derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, are no longer needed for this purpose, and are voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines used in our research must be acceptably derived. California regulations further require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used. Lineage programs that involve the use of stem cells have been reviewed by a SCRO Committee to confirm compliance with federal and state guidelines.
 
The hES cell lines that we use are all on the NIH registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants. All of our research programs utilize stem cells from established and well-characterized cell lines and which are capable of self-renewal and expansion through normal cellular division (mitosis). Our research programs do not require new tissue or cells from donors of any kind.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Other Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations impose obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process individually identifiable protected health information, with respect to protecting the privacy, security, and transmission of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for covered health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. Additionally, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal and state laws prohibit fraud and abuse. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for HHS, and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. These contractors include Recovery Audit Contractors, Medicaid Integrity Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. In addition, CMS conducts Comprehensive Error Rate Testing audits, the purpose of which is to detect improper Medicare payments. Any overpayments identified must be repaid unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the federal Anti- Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit certain common activities within the health care industry, the Office of Inspector General for HHS has issued a series of statutory exceptions and regulatory “safe harbors.” However, these exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of their facts and circumstances. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens on behalf of the government, through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
 
HIPAA also created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
 
Many states have laws similar to the federal laws described above and the state laws may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above, or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with medical products. Accordingly, market acceptance of medical products can depend on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities, private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Pharmaceutical companies may be required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products it sells to certain government funded programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and those rebates or discounts have increased over time. The ACA increased many of these mandatory discounts and rebates required and imposed a new branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers fee payable each year by certain pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers.
 
Outside of the United States, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.

Healthcare Reform
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 
In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional, and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. In addition, legislation enacted in 2017, informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Since the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when or how the Supreme Court will rule. Accordingly, it is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The likelihood of implementation of any of these, or the other Trump administration reform initiatives is uncertain, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Marketing
 
Therapeutic Products and Medical Devices
 
Because our planned therapeutic products and medical devices are still in the research and development stage, we will not initially need to have our own marketing personnel. If we or our subsidiaries are successful in developing marketable therapeutic products and medical devices, we will need to build our own marketing and distribution capability for those products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we and our subsidiaries will need to find collaborative marketing partners, independent sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of those products.
 
If we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. This means that our gross profit from product sales may be less than would be the case if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. On the other hand, selling to distributors or through independent sales representatives would allow us to avoid the cost of hiring and training our own sales employees. There can be no assurance we will be able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.
 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition in all fields of business in which we engage. That competition is likely to intensify as new products and technologies reach the market. Superior new products are likely to sell for higher prices and generate higher profit margins if acceptance by the medical community is achieved. Those companies that are successful at being the first to introduce new products and technologies to the market may gain significant economic advantages over their competitors in the establishment of a customer base and track record for the performance of their products and technologies. Such companies will also benefit from revenues from sales that could be used to strengthen their research and development, production, and marketing resources. Companies engaged in the medical products industry face the risk of obsolescence of their products and technologies as more advanced or cost-effective products and technologies are developed by competitors. As the industry matures, companies will compete based upon the performance and cost-effectiveness of their products. Specific efforts in the development of treatments for dry AMD include, but are not limited to, neuroprotection, reducing by-product accumulation, and suppressing inflammation. Specific approaches include small molecules, antibodies, and cell therapies. Some of these efforts have reached clinical development and at least one approach, complement inhibition, is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial. We believe that replacing the entire cell rather than attempts to fix one aberrant pathway or signal confer a greater probability of success for individuals suffering with dry AMD.

Products for Regenerative Medicine
 
The cell therapy industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford the smaller companies’ potential research and development as well as commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities, which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing.
 
We believe that some of our competitors are trying to develop pluripotent cells and human embryonic progenitor cell-based technologies and products that may compete with our stem cell products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions. Ocata Therapeutics, Inc. (“Ocata”), which was acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma Inc. for approximately $379 million in 2016, and Retinal Patch Technologies Inc. have conducted clinical trials of hES cell products designed to treat dry AMD. If their products are proven to be safe and effective, they may reach the market ahead of OpRegen.
 
We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the propagation and differentiation of stem cells. Those companies include Ocata, which in 2015 had certain U.S. patents issue with claims directed to methods of producing RPE cells and isolating and purifying such cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain products proposed by us, and such licenses may not be granted.
