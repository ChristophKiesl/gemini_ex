Item 1. Business
Summary
 
Laredo Oil, Inc. (the Company) is an oil exploration and production (E&P) company primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral properties. From June 14, 2011 to December 31, 2020, the Company was a management services company managing the acquisition and conventional operation of mature oil fields and the further recovery of stranded oil from those fields using enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods for its sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation (SORC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation (Alleghany).
 
From its inception through October 2009, the Company was primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for mineral properties. After a change in control in October 2009, the Company shifted its focus to locating mature oil fields with the intention of acquiring those oil fields and recovering stranded oil using EOR methods. The Company was unable to raise the capital required to purchase any suitable oil fields. On June 14, 2011, the Company entered into several agreements with SORC to seek recovery of stranded crude oil from mature, declining oil fields by using the EOR method known as Underground Gravity Drainage (UGD). Such agreements consisted of a license agreement between the Company and SORC (the SORC License Agreement), a license agreement between the Company and Mark See, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (the MS-Company License Agreement), an Additional Interests Grant Agreement between the Company and SORC, a Management Services Agreement between the Company and SORC (the MSA), a Finders Fee Agreement between the Company and SORC (the Finders Fee Agreement), and a Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement) among the Company, SORC and Alleghany Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of Alleghany (Alleghany Capital), each of which were dated June 14, 2011 (collectively, the 2011 SORC Agreements).
 
Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement dated December 31, 2020 (the SORC Purchase Agreement), by and among the Company, Alleghany, SORC, and SORC Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (SORC Holdings), SORC Holdings purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of SORC stock (the SORC Shares) in a transaction that closed on December 31, 2020 (the SORC Purchase Transaction). As consideration for the SORC Shares, SORC Holdings paid Alleghany $72,678 (comprised of $55,000 purchase price plus a $17,678 working capital adjustment calculated in accordance with the SORC Purchase Agreement), and the Company agreed to pay to Alleghany a revenue royalty of 5.0% of the Companys future revenues and net profits relating to oil, gas, gas liquids and all other hydrocarbons, subject to certain adjustments, for a period of seven years after the closing. The SORC Purchase Agreement provides for customary adjustments to the purchase price based on the effective date of December 31, 2020. In connection with the SORC Purchase Transaction, the 2011 SORC Agreements were terminated effective as of December 31, 2020.
 
Further, pursuant to the SORC Purchase Agreement, the Company and Alleghany entered into a Consulting Agreement dated as of December 31, 2020 (the Alleghany Consulting Agreement), pursuant to which Alleghany agreed to pay an aggregate of approximately $1.245 million during calendar year 2021 in consideration of the Company causing certain individuals, including Mark See, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Chris Lindsey, the Companys General Counsel and Secretary, to provide consulting services to Alleghany (for a period of three years for Mr. See and one year for Mr. Lindsey).
 
The Company believes that the SORC Purchase Transaction was advantageous as it simplified in a timely manner the unwinding of the 2011 SORC Agreements and allowed the Company to acquire vehicles and oil field assets that can be utilized in future oil recovery projects.
 
As the Company now owns SORC and the 2011 SORC Agreements have been terminated, the Company no longer receives any payments from SORC (including any Royalty payable by SORC to the Company) outlined in the 2011 SORC Agreements. As a result, except for the payments to be made in calendar year 2021 to the Company under the Alleghany Consulting Agreement, the Company will no longer receive management fee revenue from Alleghany or reimbursement from Alleghany for the monthly expenses of its employees, which fees and reimbursements were effectively all of the Companys revenues prior to the closing of the SORC Purchase Transaction.

During the period from June 14, 2011 through December 31, 2020, Company management gained specialized know-how and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring, operating and developing oil and gas properties while implementing UGD projects, as well as gaining expertise designing, drilling and producing conventional oil wells. Based upon the knowledge gained, the Company has identified and has acquired 23,739 acres of mineral properties in Montana. An initial target of 10 drilling locations has been identified with the intention to drill a development well there in calendar year 2021 and, if that well yields anticipated results, the Company plans to develop the field thereafter.


On June 30, 2020, the Company entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement (the LLC Agreement) of Cat Creek Holdings LLC (Cat Creek), a Montana limited liability company formed as a joint venture with Lipson Investments LLC (Lipson) and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC (Viper) for the purchase of certain oil and gas properties in the Cat Creek Field in Petroleum and Garfield Counties in the State of Montana (the Cat Creek Properties). Cat Creek entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Cat Creek Purchase Agreement) with Carrell Oil Company (Carrell Oil) on July 1, 2020 for the purchase of the Cat Creek Properties from Seller. Upon closing under the Cat Creek Purchase Agreement, Carrell received consideration of $400,000, subject to certain adjustments resulting from pre- and post-effective date revenue, expense and tax allocations. In accordance with the LLC Agreement, the Company invested $448,900 in Cat Creek for 50% of the ownership interests in Cat Creek using cash on hand. Each of Lipson Investments LLC and Viper Oil & Gas, LLC, the other two members of Cat Creek, have ownership interests in Cat Creek of 25% in consideration of their respective investments of $224,450. Cat Creek will be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of four directors, two of which shall be designated by the Company.
 
The original UGD method used conventional mining processes to establish a drilling chamber underneath an existing oil field from where closely spaced wellbores were intended to be drilled up into the reservoir, using residual radial pressure and gravity to then drain the targeted reservoir through the wellbores. As experience has been gained through practical application of the processes involved in oil recovery, variants of the UGD concept are continually developed and evaluated. The UGD method is applicable to mature oil fields that have very specific geological characteristics. The Company has done extensive research and has identified oil fields within the United States that it believes are qualified for UGD recovery methods. We believe the costs of implementing the UGD method are significantly lower than those presently experienced by other commonly used EOR methods. We also estimate that we can materially increase the field oil production rate from prior periods and, in some cases, recover amounts of oil equal to or greater than amounts previously recovered from the mature fields selected.
 
Our shares are currently listed for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) under the symbol LRDC. As of the date of this report, there has been light to medium trading for our common stock and we cannot provide assurance that an active trading market for our securities will ever develop.
 
General – Company Business during the Reporting Period until December 31, 2020
 
A description of the 2011 SORC Agreements effective during all periods shown prior to and including December 31, 2020 follows. In connection with the SORC Purchase Transaction, the 2011 SORC Agreements were terminated effective as of December 31, 2020.
 
The 2011 SORC Agreements stipulated that the Company and Mark See, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), will provide to SORC, management services and expertise through exclusive, perpetual license agreements and a management services agreement (the Management Service Agreement) with SORC. As consideration for the licenses to SORC, the Company will receive an interest in SORCs net profits as defined in the Agreements (the Royalty). The Management Service Agreement (MSA) outlines that the Company will provide the services of various employees (Service Employees), including Mark See, in exchange for monthly and quarterly management service fees. The monthly management service fees provide funding for the salaries, benefit costs, and FICA taxes for the Service Employees identified in the MSA. SORC remits payment for the monthly management fees in advance and is payable on the first day of each calendar month. The quarterly management fee totals $137,500 and is paid on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the last payment being received October 1, 2020. In addition, prior to December 31, 2020, SORC reimbursed the Company for monthly expenses incurred by Service Employees in connection with their rendition of services under the MSA. The Company could also submit written requests to SORC for additional funding for payment of the Companys operating costs and expenses, which SORC, in its sole and absolute discretion, determined whether or not to fund.

As consideration for the licenses to SORC, the Company was to receive a 19.49% interest in SORC net profits as defined in the SORC License Agreement (the SORC License Agreement). Under the SORC License Agreement, the Company agreed that a portion of the Royalty equal to at least 2.25% of the net profits (Incentive Royalty) be used to fund a long-term incentive plan for the benefit of its employees, as determined by the Companys board of directors. On October 11, 2012, the Laredo Royalty Incentive Plan (the Plan) was approved and adopted by the Board and the Incentive Royalty was assigned by the Company to Laredo Royalty Incentive Plan, LLC, a special purpose Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company formed to carry out the purposes of the Plan (the Plan Entity). Through February 28, 2021 the subsidiary has received no distributions from SORC. As a result of the assignment of the Incentive Royalty to the Plan Entity, the Royalty retained by the Company has been reduced from 19.49% to 17.24% subject to reduction to 15% under certain events stipulated in the SORC License Agreement. Additionally, in the event of a SORC initial public offering or certain other defined corporate events, the Company was to receive 17.24%, subject to reduction to 15% under the SORC License Agreement, of the SORC common equity or proceeds emanating from the event in exchange for termination of the Royalty. Under certain circumstances regarding termination of exclusivity and license terminations, the Royalty could be reduced to 7.25%. If any Incentive Royalty is funded as a result of those conditions being met, the Company may record compensation expense for the fair value of the Incentive Royalty, once all pertinent factors are known and considered probable. As the Royalty is no longer payable by SORC to the Company as a result of the SORC Purchase Transaction referenced above, there are also no longer any Incentive Royalties payable pursuant to the Plan.
 
Prior to the Company receiving any Royalty cash distributions from SORC, all SORC preferred share accrued dividends would have been required to be paid (in excess of $200 million as of December 31, 2020), preferred shares redeemed (in excess of $270 million as of December 31, 2020), and debt retired to comply with any loan agreements. No Royalties have been received by the Company. As referenced above, as a result of the SORC Purchase Transaction, no Royalties will be paid to the Company by SORC in the future.
 
Competition
 
Our operating results are largely dependent upon competition from other oil companies in all areas of operation, including the acquisition of mature fields, and that such competitors may include large, well established companies with substantial capital resources.
Pandemic; Oil and Gas Price Volatility
 
Market prices for oil and gas collapsed in the first six months of calendar year 2020 as the combination of the COVID-19 global pandemic (the Pandemic) and geopolitical tensions among the worlds energy producers resulted in the simultaneous reduction of demand and increase in supply of crude. The price shock has adversely affected the results, prospects and values of investments in energy-related businesses which businesses are likely to remain pressured until the uncertainty around the Pandemic and the price of energy products recovers. Although prices recovered somewhat over the first half of calendar year 2021, they still remain volatile.
 
The long-term impacts of the global emergence of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on our business are currently unknown. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive, aggressive action from the earliest signs of the outbreak in China to adopt social distancing policies at our locations, including working from home, limiting the number of employees attending meetings, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. We anticipate that the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact business activity. We have observed declining demand and price reductions in the oil and gas sector as business and consumer activity decelerates across the globe. When COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, we anticipate a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments.

Item 1. Business - continued
 
We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and prospects, or on our financial results for the remainder of 2021.
 
Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks
 
Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. We believe that the cost and timing of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and that drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including low oil prices, title problems, reservoir characteristics, weather conditions, equipment failures, delays by project participants, compliance with governmental requirements, shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services and increases in the cost for such equipment and services. Future oil recovery activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Company operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil, such as fires, natural disasters, explosions, encountering formations with abnormal pressures, blowouts, craterings, pipeline ruptures and spills, any of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons, environmental pollution, personal injury claims and other damage to Company properties and those of others. The Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. In particular, the insurance we maintain does not cover claims relating to failure of title to oil leases, loss of surface equipment at well locations, business interruption, loss of revenue due to low commodity prices or loss of revenues due to well failure. The occurrence of an event that is not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance which we maintain or may acquire, could have a material adverse effect on our sales in the period such event may occur.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Oil and natural gas exploration, production, transportation and marketing activities are subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations promulgated by federal and state legislatures and agencies, including but not limited to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and various state regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with such laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties, including the delay or stopping of our operations. The legislative and regulatory burden on the oil industry increases our cost of doing business.
 
State regulatory agencies, as well as the federal government when operating on federal or Indian lands, require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil. These governmental authorities also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. In each jurisdiction, we will most likely need exceptions to some regulations requiring regulatory approval. All of these matters could affect our operations.
 
Environmental Matters
 
The oil industry is subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, as well as safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and this trend is likely to continue. These laws and regulations may require a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences, and for certain other activities, limit or prohibit access, seismic acquisition, construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas, impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations, and require the reclamation of certain lands.

Item 1. Business - continued
 
The permits that are required for oil and gas operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.
 
Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill prevention, control countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. For onshore and offshore facilities that may affect waters of the United States, the OPA requires an operator to demonstrate financial responsibility. Regulations are currently being developed under federal and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on participants in the oil and gas industry. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require permits to be obtained to authorize discharge into surface waters or to construct facilities in wetland areas. The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its subsequent amendments in 1990 and 1997 also impose permit requirements and necessitate certain restrictions on point source emissions of volatile organic carbons (nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide) and particulates with respect to certain of our operations. The EPA and designated state agencies have in place regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff and stationary sources of air emissions. These programs require covered facilities to obtain individual permits, participate in a group or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. Most agencies recognize the unique qualities of oil and natural gas exploration and production operations. A number of agencies, including but not limited to MSHA, the EPA, the BLM, and similar state commissions, have adopted regulatory guidance in consideration of the operational limitations on these types of facilities and their potential to emit pollutants.
