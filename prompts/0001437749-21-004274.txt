ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a leading vertically integrated company that is primarily engaged in the geothermal and recovered energy power businesses. We leveraged our core capabilities and global presence to expand our activity into different energy storage services and solar photovoltaic (PV) (including hybrid geothermal and solar PV as well as energy storage plus Solar PV). Our objective is to become a leading global provider of renewable energy and we have adopted a strategic plan to focus on several key initiatives to expand our business.
 
We currently conduct our business activities in three business segments:
 

• | Electricity Segment. In the Electricity segment, which contributed 76.8% of our total revenues in 2020, we develop, build, own and operate geothermal, solar PV and recovered energy-based power plants in the United States and geothermal power plants in other countries around the world and sell the electricity they generate. In 2020, we derived 63.1% of our Electricity segment revenues from our operations in the U.S. and 36.9% from the rest of the world.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product Segment. In the Product segment, which contributed 21.0% of our total revenues in 2020, we design, manufacture and sell equipment for geothermal and recovered energy-based electricity generation and remote power units and provide services relating to the engineering, procurement and construction of geothermal and recovered energy-based power plants. In 2020, we derived 3.9% of our Product segment revenues from our operations in the United States and 96.1% from the rest of the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Energy Storage Segment. In the Energy Storage segment, which contributed 2.2% of our total revenues in 2020, we mainly provide energy storage, related services as well as services relating to the engineering, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance of energy storage units. In 2020, we derived all of our Energy Storage segment revenues from our operations in the United States.

Technology and products we use in our operations include geothermal, recovered energy, solar PV and energy storage.
 
Our owned geothermal power plants include both power plants that we have built and power plants that we have acquired. The substantial majority of the power plants that we currently own or operate produce electricity from geothermal energy sources. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable and generally sustainable form of energy derived from the natural heat of the earth. Unlike electricity produced by burning fossil fuels, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources is produced without emissions of certain pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, and with far lower emissions of other pollutants such as carbon dioxide. As a result, electricity produced from geothermal energy sources contributes significantly less to global warming and local and regional incidences of acid rain than energy produced by burning fossil fuels. In addition, compared to power plants that utilize other renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar, geothermal power plants are generally available all year-long and all day-long and can therefore provide base-load electricity services. Geothermal power plants can also be custom built to provide a range of electricity services such as baseload, voltage regulation, reserve and flexible capacity. Geothermal energy is also an attractive alternative to other sources of energy and can support a diversification strategy to avoid dependence on any one energy source or politically sensitive supply sources. We own and operate a geothermal and solar PV hybrid project and have similar projects currently  under construction, in which the electricity generated from a solar PV power plant is used to offset the equipment’s energy use at the geothermal facility, thus increasing the renewable energy delivered by the project to the grid.
 
In addition to our geothermal energy business, we manufacture and sell products that produce electricity from recovered energy or so-called “waste heat”. We also construct, own, and operate recovered energy-based power plants. We have built all of the recovered energy-based plants that we operate. Recovered energy comes from residual heat that is generated as a by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing. Such residual heat, which would otherwise be wasted, may be captured in the recovery process and used by recovered energy power plants to generate electricity without burning additional fuel and without additional emissions.
 
In our Energy Storage segment, we commissioned three energy storage facilities with a total of 42 MW in New Jersey and Vermont, a 10 MW facility in Texas and acquired a 20 MW facility in California. We plan to accelerate long-term growth in the Energy Storage segment market to  establish a leading position in the U.S..
 
Our Power Generation Business (Electricity Segment)
 
Each of our current geothermal power plants sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed price PPAs to various counterparties denominated in or linked to the US dollar or Euro. These contracts had a total weighted average remaining term, based on contributions to segment revenue, of approximately 16 years at December 31, 2020. In addition, the counterparties to our PPAs in the United States had a credit rating of between Aa3 to Baa2 by Moody's and  BB- to A by S&P. The purchasers of electricity from our foreign power plants are mainly state-owned entities in countries with below investment grade rating.
Power Plants in Operation 
 
We own and operate 25 geothermal, REG and solar sites globally with an aggregate generating capacity of 932 MW. Geothermal comprises 94% of our generating capacity. In 2020, our geothermal and REG power plants generated at a capacity factor of 87% and 59%, respectively, which is much higher than typical capacity factors for wind and solar producers that are usually at 20% to 30%.

1. | We indirectly own and operate all of our power plants, although financial institutions hold equity interests in three of our subsidiaries: (i) Opal Geo subsidiaries, which own the McGinness Hills Phases 1 and 2 geothermal power plants, the Tuscarora and Jersey Valley power plants and the second phase of the Don A. Campbell power plant, all located in Nevada; (ii) ORNI 41, which owns the McGinness Hills Phase 3 located in Nevada; and (iii) ORNI 43, which owns the Tungsten Mountain geothermal power plant located in Nevada. In the table above, we list these power plants as being 100% owned because all of the generating capacity is owned by these subsidiaries and we control the operation of the power plants. The nature of the equity interests held by the financial institution is described below in Item 8 — “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under Note 13.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Notwithstanding our 63.75% equity interest in the Bouillante power plant, 60% equity interest in the Neal Hot Spring power plant and 63.25% direct equity interest in the Puna plant, the first phase of Don A. Campbell, OREG 1, OREG 2 and OREG 3 power plants as well as the indirect interest in the second phase of the Don A. Campbell complex owned by our subsidiary, ORPD, we list 100% of the generating capacity of the Bouillante power plant, the Neal Hot Springs power plant and the power plants in the ORPD portfolio in the table above because we control their operations. We list our 12.75% share of the generating capacity of the Sarulla complex as we own a 12.75% minority interest. Revenues from the Sarulla complex are not consolidated and are presented under “Equity in earnings (losses) of investees, net” in our financial statements.
 

2. | References to generating capacity generally refer to gross generating capacity less auxiliary power. We determine the generating capacity of these power plants by taking into account resource and power plant capabilities. In any given year, the actual power generation of a particular power plant may differ from that power plant’s generating capacity due to variations in ambient temperature, the availability of the geothermal resource, and operational issues affecting performance during that year.

3. | The Steamboat complex includes the Steamboat Hills enhancement that commenced commercial operation in June, 2020. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Tungsten Mountain is a hybrid geothermal and solar power plant that uses the solar energy for geothermal power plant auxiliary power. The solar power plant generates 7 MW and is presented separately in the table above.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | We own 60% and Enbridge owns 40% of the Neal Hot Springs power plant.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | The Puna geothermal power plant has been shut down since May 3, 2018 when the Kilauea volcano located in close proximity to it erupted following a significant increase in seismic activity in the area. In November 2020, Puna resumed operations and currently it is operating at a generating capacity of approximately 13MW . In addition, we signed an amended PPA to extend its duration and expand its contract capacity as described below in Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings "Recent Development".
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | In Zunil, power plant revenues used to be calculated based on 24 MW of generating capacity and was unrelated to the performance of the reservoir. In 2019 and onward, revenues are calculated based on the actual generation of the power plant, therefore the generating capacity was updated to reflect the current generating capacity.

8. | Capacity factor for Olkaria adds back the curtailed MWh.
---+---------------------------------------------------------


9. | We own 63.75%, CDC owns 21.25% and Sageos owns 15.0% of the Bouillante power plant.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10. | The total availability of the geothermal power plants excludes the Puna power plant that is not in operation, as discussed above.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11. | The OREG 4 power plant is not operating at full capacity due to low run time of the compressor station that serves as the power plant’s heat source. This has resulted in lower power generation.

New Power Plants
 
We are currently in various stages of construction of new power plants and expansion of existing power plants. Our construction and expansion plans include 92 MW in generating capacity from geothermal and solar PV power plants in the United States. In addition, we have several geothermal and solar PV projects in the United States, Indonesia, Guatemala and Guadeloupe that are either under initial stages of construction or under different stages of development with an aggregate capacity of between 98 MW and 108 MW.
 
    13 

  

We have substantial land positions across 31 prospects in the United States and 10 prospects in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia and New Zealand that we expect will support future geothermal development and on which we have started or plan to start exploration activity. These land positions are comprised of various leases, exploration concessions for geothermal resources and an option to enter into leases.
 
We expect adding between 250 MW to 270 MW of Geothermal and Solar PV by the end of 2023.
 
Our Product Business (Product Segment)
 
We design, manufacture and sell products for electricity generation and provide the related services described below. In addition, we recently started to provide cementing services for well drilling to third parties. We primarily manufacture products to fill customer orders, but in some situations, we manufacture products as inventory for future projects that we will own and for future third party projects.
Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants

We design, manufacture and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. In geothermal power plants using OECs, geothermal fluid (either hot water, also called brine, or steam or both) is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead to a vaporizer that heats a secondary working fluid, which is vaporized and used to drive the turbine. The secondary fluid is then condensed in a condenser, which may be cooled directly by air through an air cooling system or by water from a cooling tower and sent back to the vaporizer. The cooled geothermal fluid is then reinjected back into the reservoir. Our customers include contractors, geothermal power plant developers, owners and operators.
Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation

We design, manufacture and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy, or so-called “waste heat”. This heat is generated as a residual by-product of gas turbine-driven compressor stations, solar thermal units and a variety of industrial processes, such as cement manufacturing, and is not otherwise used for any purpose. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, and other companies engaged in other energy-intensive industrial processes.
 
EPC of Power Plants
 
We serve as an EPC contractor for geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered energy-based power units as described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe that our competitive advantage is in using equipment that we manufacture allowing us better quality and control over the timing and delivery of required equipment and its related costs.
 
Remote Power Units and Other Generators

We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. Our customers include contractors who install gas pipelines in remote areas and offshore platform operators and contractors. In addition, we design, manufacture, and sell generators, including heavy duty direct-current generators, for various other uses.
Our Energy Storage Segment
 
Our energy storage segment has grown consistently in 2019 and 2020 and we expect continuous and even stronger growth over the coming years, while we target the sector as one of our major segments for further investment and growth.
 
    14 

  

In 2020, we successfully brought on line one new Ormat-owned BESS project, the 10 MW/10 MWh Rabbit Hill project in Georgetown, Texas.  We also acquired the operating 20 MW / 80 MWh Pomona BESS project in southern California, that has been in commercial operation since December 2016 under a 10-year resource adequacy agreement with Southern California Edison. These activities brought our total operating portfolio at the end of 2020 to approximately 73 MW / 136 MWh within the footprint of 4 RTOs or ISOs: CAISO, PJM Interconnect, ERCOT and ISONE.
 
We are currently in the final commissioning stage of our 10 MW / 40 MWh Vallecito project in southern California, for which we secured a 20-year resource adequacy agreement with Southern California Edison. We are also in the process of constructing a 5 MW / 20 MWh Tierra Buena project in northern California, which we expect to reach commercial operation by the end of 2021 and our Andover 20 MW project in NJ, which we expect to reach commercial operation in the first quarter of 2022 and Howel 7 MW project in NJ, which we expect to reach commercial operation in the second quarter of 2022. We acquired rights in a project under development, in Upton County, Texas, and plan to start the construction of a 25 MW / 25 MWh BESS project there before the end of 2021. 
 
We have a approximately 1.2 GW pipeline of additional potential projects, in different stages of development across the United States that we believe we will be able to commission between 200 MW and 300 MW by 2023. The development of such projects is dependent, inter alia, on site permitting, interconnection agreement and economic viability, which are not certain. We plan to continue leveraging our experience in project development and finance, as well as our engineering, procurement and construction know-how and our relationships with utilities and other market participants, to develop additional BESS projects.

Industry Background 
 
Geothermal Energy 
 
There are several different sources or methods of obtaining geothermal energy, which are described below.
 
Hydrothermal geothermal-electricity generation — Hydrothermal geothermal energy is derived from naturally occurring hydrothermal reservoirs that are formed when water comes sufficiently close to hot rock to heat the water to temperatures of 300 degrees Fahrenheit or more. The heated water then ascends toward the surface of the earth where, if geological conditions are suitable for its commercial extraction, it can be extracted by drilling geothermal wells. Geothermal production wells are normally located within several miles of the power plant, as it is not economically viable to transport geothermal fluids over longer distances due to heat and pressure loss. The geothermal reservoir is a renewable source of energy if: (i) natural ground water sources and reinjection of extracted geothermal fluids are adequate over the long-term to replenish the geothermal reservoir following the withdrawal of geothermal fluids and (ii) the well field is properly operated. Geothermal energy power plants typically have higher capital costs (primarily because of the costs attributable to well field development) but tend to have significantly lower variable operating costs (principally consisting of maintenance expenditures) than fossil fuel-fired power plants that require ongoing fuel expenses.
EGS — An EGS is a subsurface system that may be artificially created to extract heat from hot rock where the permeability and aquifers required for a hydrothermal system are insufficient or non-existent. A geothermal power plant that uses EGS techniques recovers the thermal energy from the subsurface rocks by creating or accessing a system of open fractures in the rock through which water can be injected, heated through contact with the hot rock, returned to the surface in production wells and transferred to a power unit.
 
Co-produced geothermal from oil and gas fields, geo-pressurized resources — Another source of geothermal energy is hot water produced as a by-product of oil and gas extraction. When oil and gas wells are deep, the extracted fluids are often at high temperatures and if the water volume associated with the extracted fluids is significant, the hot water can be used for power generation in equipment similar to a geothermal power plant.
 
Geothermal Power Plant Technologies 
 
Geothermal power plants generally employ either binary systems or conventional flash design systems, as briefly described below. In our geothermal power plants, we also employ our proprietary technology of combined geothermal cycle systems.
 
    18 

  

Binary System
 
In a geothermal power plant using a binary system, geothermal fluid (either hot water (also called brine) or steam or both) is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead through a gathering system of insulated steel pipelines to a vaporizer that heats a secondary working fluid. This is typically an organic fluid, such as pentane or butane, which is vaporized and is used to drive the turbine. The organic fluid is then condensed in a condenser, which may be cooled directly by air or by water from a cooling tower and sent back to the vaporizer through a pump. The cooled geothermal fluid is then reinjected back into the reservoir. The operation of our air-cooled binary geothermal power plant is depicted in the diagram below.
Flash Design System
 
In a geothermal power plant using flash design, geothermal fluid is extracted from the underground reservoir and flows from the wellhead through a gathering system of insulated steel pipelines to flash tanks and/or separators. There, the steam is separated from the brine and is sent to a demister, where any remaining water droplets are removed. This produces a stream of dry saturated steam, which drives a steam turbine generator to produce electricity. In some cases, the brine at the outlet of the separator is flashed a second time (dual flash), providing additional steam at lower pressure used in the low-pressure section of the steam turbine to produce additional electricity. Steam exhausted from the steam turbine is condensed in a surface or direct contact condenser cooled by cold water from a cooling tower. The non-condensable gases (such as carbon dioxide) are removed by means of a vacuum system in order to maintain the performance of the steam condenser. The resulting condensate is used to provide make-up water for the cooling tower. The hot brine remaining after separation of steam is injected (either directly or after passing through a binary plant to produce additional power from the residual heat remaining in the brine) back into the geothermal resource through a series of injection wells. The flash technology is depicted in the diagram below.
 


In some instances, the wells directly produce dry steam and the steam is fed directly to the steam turbine with the rest of the system similar to the flash technology described above.

Our Proprietary Technology
 
Our proprietary technology may be used either in power plants operating according to the ORC alone or in combination with various other commonly used thermodynamic technologies that convert heat to mechanical power, such as gas and steam turbines. It can be used with a variety of thermal energy sources, such as geothermal, recovered energy, biomass, solar energy and fossil fuels. Specifically, our technology involves original designs of turbines, pumps, and heat exchangers, as well as formulation of organic motive fluids (all of which are non-ozone-depleting substances). By using advanced computational fluid dynamics techniques and other computer aided design software as well as our test facilities, we continuously seek to improve power plant components, reduce operations and maintenance costs, and increase the range of our equipment and applications. We are always examining ways to increase the output of our plants by utilizing evaporative cooling, cold reinjection, configuration optimization, and topping turbines.
 
We also developed, patented and constructed GCCU power plants in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. Our Geothermal Combined Cycle technology is depicted in the diagram below.
 


In the conversion of geothermal energy into electricity, our technology has a number of advantages over conventional geothermal steam turbine plants. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant consumes significant quantities of water, causing depletion of the aquifer and requiring cooling water treatment with chemicals and consequently a need for the disposal of such chemicals. A conventional geothermal steam turbine plant also creates a significant visual impact in the form of an emitted plume from the cooling towers, especially during cold weather. By contrast, our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants have a low profile with minimal visual impact and do not emit a plume when they use air-cooled condensers. Our binary and combined cycle geothermal power plants reinject all of the geothermal fluids utilized in the respective processes into the geothermal reservoir. Consequently, such processes generally have no emissions.
 
Other advantages of our technology include simplicity of operation and maintenance and higher yearly availability. For instance, the OEC employs a low speed and high efficiency organic vapor turbine directly coupled to the generator, eliminating the need for reduction gear. In addition, with our binary design, there is no contact between the turbine blade and geothermal fluids, which can often be very erosive and corrosive. Instead, the geothermal fluids pass through a heat exchanger, which is less susceptible to erosion and can adapt much better to corrosive fluids. In addition, with the organic vapor condensed above atmospheric pressure, no vacuum system is required.
 
    20 

  

We use the same elements of our technology in our recovered energy products. The heat source may be exhaust gases from a Brayton cycle gas turbine, low-pressure steam, or medium temperature liquid found in the process industries such as oil refining and cement manufacturing. In most cases, we attach an additional heat exchanger in which we circulate thermal oil or water to transfer the heat into the OEC’s own vaporizer in order to provide greater operational flexibility and control. Once this stage of each recovery is completed, the rest of the operation is identical to that of the OECs used in our geothermal power plants and enjoys the same advantages of using the ORC. In addition, our technology allows for better load following than conventional steam turbines, requires no water treatment (since it is air cooled and organic fluid motivated), and does not require the continuous presence of a licensed steam boiler operator on site.
 
Our REG technology is depicted in the diagram below.
 


Patents 
 
As of February 24, 2021, we have 62 issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application. These patents and patent applications cover our products (mainly power units based on the ORC) and systems (mainly geothermal power plants and industrial waste heat recovery plants for electricity production). The product-related patents cover components that include turbines, heat exchangers, air coolers, seals and controls as well as control of operation of geothermal production well pumps. The system-related patents cover not only particular components but also the overall energy conversion system from the “fuel supply” (e.g., geothermal fluid, waste heat, biomass or solar) to electricity production.
 
The system-related patents also cover subjects such as waste heat recovery related to gas pipeline compressors and industrial waste heat, solar power systems, disposal of non-condensable gases present in geothermal fluids, reinjection of other geothermal fluids ensuring geothermal resource sustainability, power plants for very high-pressure geothermal resources, two-phase fluids, low temperature geothermal brine as well as processes related to EGS. 55 of our patents cover combined cycle geothermal power plants, in which the steam first produces power in a backpressure steam turbine and is subsequently condensed in a vaporizer of a binary plant, which produces additional power. The remaining terms of our issued patents range from one year to 16 years. The loss of any single patent would not have a material effect on our business or results of operations.

Market Opportunities 
 
Geothermal Market Opportunities 
 
Renewable energy in general provides a sustainable alternative to the existing solutions to two major global issues: climate change and diminishing fossil fuel reserves. Renewable energy is sustainable, clean and decarbonizes the grid. These environmental benefits have led major countries to focus their efforts on the development of renewable energy sources in general and geothermal specifically.
 
Based on the IGA, as of January 2021, geothermal power is generated in 29 countries with a total installed power generation capacity of 15,600 MW at the end of 2020. The leading countries are the U.S., Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, Mexico and New Zealand. The IGA estimates an additional 4,000 MW will be added by 2025.
 
Having realized the importance of renewable energy including geothermal alternatives, various governments have been preparing regulatory frameworks and policies, and providing incentives to develop the sector.
 
United States
 
Interest in geothermal energy in the United States remains strong for numerous reasons, including legislative support, RPS goals (as described below), coal, natural gas and nuclear power plant retirements, and an increasing awareness of the positive value of geothermal characteristics when compared to intermittent renewable technologies.
 
Today, electricity generation from geothermal resources is concentrated mainly in California, Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, and we believe there are opportunities for expansion in other states such as New Mexico due to the potential of its geothermal resources and recent legislation that has increased its renewable energy goals to 100% by 2045 for investor-owned utilities.
 
Geothermal energy provides numerous benefits to the U.S. grid and economy. Geothermal development and operation bring economic benefits in the form of taxes and long term high-paying jobs, and it currently has one of the lowest LCOE of all power sources in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's report published in February 2019. Additionally, improvements in geothermal production make it possible to provide ancillary and on-demand services. This helps load serving entities avoid additional costs from purchasing and then balancing intermittent resources with storage or new transmission.
 
At the end of 2020, the United States Congress passed one of its most significant energy legislation in over a decade as part of the omnibus spending and coronavirus relief package. The legislation includes a budget for the Geothermal Technology Office to support geothermal research and development, a one-year extension of the production tax credit, and specific language to improve permitting efforts for renewable projects on federal land.
 
    22 

  

State level legislation
 
Many state governments have enacted an RPS program under which utilities are required to include renewable energy sources as part of their energy generation. Under an RPS, participating states have set targets for the production of their energy from renewable sources by specified dates. Renewable energy generation under RPS programs are tracked through the production of RECs. Load serving entities track the RECs to ensure they are meeting the mandate prescribed by the RPS.
 
Currently in the United States, 42 states plus the District of Colombia and four territories have enacted an RPS, renewable portfolio goals, or similar laws or incentives (such as clean energy standards or goals) requiring or encouraging load serving entities in such states to generate or buy a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable energy or recovered heat sources. The vast majority of Ormat’s geothermal projects can be found in California, Nevada, and Hawaii which have some of the most stringent RPS programs in the country.
 
We see the impact of RPS and climate legislation as the most significant driver for us to expand existing power plants and to build new renewable projects.
 
Below are RPS targets in the states in which we are operating:
 

State | RPS Target | Year | Remarks
-----------+------------+------+--------
California | 60 | % | 2030 | RPS targets set for future years: 44% – 2024, 52% – 2027, and 60% – 2030. 100% zero carbon by 2045. 
Nevada | 50 | % | 2030 | RPS target of 50% by 2030 and 100% zero carbon by 2050. The state has a credit multiplier for photovoltaic and on peak energy savings. 
Hawaii | 100 | % | 2045 | RPS targets set for future years: 30% by 2020, 40% by 2030, 70% by 2040 and 100% by 2045 
Oregon | 25 | % | 2025 | Increased RPS of 50% by 2040 applies to IOUs who have a share of more than 3% of the state’s load; for utilities with a load-share of 1.5% – 3%, requirement is 10% in 2025, and for utilities with a load share of less than 1.5%, it is 5% in 2025

 
States also provide incentives to geothermal energy producers. Nevada provides a property tax abatement of up to 55% for real and tangible personal property used to generate electricity from geothermal sources. The abatement may extend up to twenty years if certain job creation requirements are met. The California Energy Commission provides favorable grants and loans to promote the development of new or existing geothermal resources and technologies within the state. In Idaho, geothermal energy producers are exempt from property tax and, in lieu, pay a tax of 3% of gross energy earnings.
 
Global

We believe the global markets continue to present growth and expansion opportunities in both established and emerging markets.
 
Operations outside of the United States may be subject to and/or benefit from increasing efforts by governments and businesses around the world to fight climate change and move towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. According to a recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency entitled Toward 100% Renewable Energy, in 2019, a total of 61 countries had set a 100% renewable energy target in at least one end-use sector, up from 60 countries in 2018.
 
We believe that several global initiatives will create business opportunities and support global growth of the renewable sector. One such initiative is the historic Paris Agreement that was approved by the Twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12, 2015. The Paris Agreement, for the first time, created a commitment by parties to this agreement to setting nationally determined efforts with the view to strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change and reporting on their progress. Following this agreement, the EIB and other multilateral institutions have committed to provide $100 billion of new financing for climate action projects over the next five years to assist countries in reaching their targets. Although former President Donald J. Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement in 2020, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will enter into force for the United States on February 19, 2021.
 
    23 

  

In addition, in 2015, a group of 20 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, China and India, pledged to double their respective budgets for renewable energy technology over five years as part of a separate initiative called Mission Innovation.  Mission Innovation celebrated its fifth year in 2020, and has since grown to 24 countries and the European Commission. Over the past five years members have raised the profile of clean energy innovation and increased investments by $4.9 billion annually.
 
Also in 2015, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition was launched by a group of 28 private investors with the objective of bringing companies with the potential to deliver affordable, reliable and carbon free power from the research lab to the market. In the same vein, in 2020, several global organizations joined the Rockefeller Foundation to form a coalition aimed at providing sustainable energy for one billion people by 2030. Joining this call to action include the African Development Bank, CDC Group plc (the UK’s development finance institution), European Investment Bank, International Energy Agency, IRENA, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The coalition aims to unleash the full potential of distributed renewable and sustainable energy systems, including technologies such as mini-grids, grid-connected local generation and storage, renewable power solutions for industrial and commercial clusters, and stand-alone commercial appliances.
 
We believe that as a general matter these developments and governmental plans will create growth and expansion opportunities for us internationally.
 
Outside of the United States, the majority of power generating capacity has historically been owned and controlled by governments. Since the early 1990s, however, many foreign governments have privatized their power generation industries through sales to third parties encouraging new capacity development and/or refurbishment of existing assets by independent power developers. These foreign governments have taken a variety of approaches to encourage the development of competitive power markets, including awarding long-term contracts for energy and capacity to independent power generators and creating competitive wholesale markets for selling and trading energy, capacity, and related products. Some foreign regions and countries have also adopted active government programs designed to encourage clean renewable energy power generation such as the following countries in which we operate, sell products and/or are conducting business development activities:
 
Europe
 
Europe has the fourth largest geothermal power capacity, the majority of which stems from Italy and Turkey. A significant part of our European operations is in Turkey. We are looking for opportunities to expand in Europe.
Turkey
 
Until recently, Turkey was the fastest growing geothermal market worldwide with the theoretical potential for 31 GW of geothermal capacity and with a proven geothermal capacity of 4.5 GW, according to the Turkish Mineral Technical Exploration Agency. Due to the economic situation in Turkey, there has been a slowdown.
 
Since 2004, we have established strong business relationships in the Turkish market and provided our range of solutions including our binary systems, to over 40 geothermal power plants with a total capacity of over 950 MW, of which one power plant is currently under construction.
 
The incentive plan and regulation for renewable energy generation in Turkey was renewed at the beginning of February 2021 for another 5 years. The updated FIT is lower than the previous one and the structure of the incentivized local manufactured items is not published yet, but will also change, to increase locally made parts. The structure of adjusting the exchange rate of the USD to the YTL has changed dramatically, both with applying the adjustment only once every three months, and by having an adjustment mechanism that takes into consideration changes not only on the USD / YTL rate, but also local indexes and the Euro exchange. Turkey’s external debt and economic status also create big burden on any project financing process. Until things improve, we estimate that the slowdown in development of new sites will continue.
 
    24 

  

The potential for geothermal growth in Turkey is still high, specifically in center-south and east areas of the country. In addition, there is a growing interest in waste heat utilization to generate electricity.
 
Latin America
 
Several Latin American countries have renewable energy programs and pursue the development of the geothermal market. We currently operate in some countries in Latin America and are looking for opportunities in others.
Guatemala
 
In Guatemala, where our Zunil and Amatitlan power plants are located, the government approved and adopted the Energy Policy 2013-2027 that secure, among other things, a supply of electricity at competitive prices by diversifying the energy mix with an 80% renewable energy share target for 2027.
Honduras
 
In Honduras, where we operate our Platanares power plant, the government set a target to reach at least 80% renewable energy production by 2034.
 
Caribbean
 
Many island nations in general and specifically the Caribbean nations, depend almost entirely on petroleum to meet their electricity needs. Caribbean nations have quite significant renewable energy potential, yet most have relatively small demand.  Other than in Guadeloupe, where the geothermal power plant that we acquired has been operating since 1985, there are no other operating geothermal projects in the Caribbean region. Although few, we believe there are geothermal opportunities for us in the Caribbean islands of St. Kitts, Nevis, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Montserrat.
New Zealand
 
In New Zealand, where we have been actively providing geothermal power plant solutions since 1988, the government’s policies to fight climate change include a net zero GHG emissions reduction target by 2050 and a renewable electricity generation target of 90% of New Zealand’s total electricity generation by 2035. We continue selling power plants and products to our New Zealand customers, secured two projects in the last two years and intensified our cooperation with other potential customers for adding more geothermal power generation capacity within the coming years.
Asia
 
Indonesia
 
 In Indonesia, where we hold a 12.75% equity interest in the Sarulla complex, we are currently conducting exploration activity in the Ijen geothermal power plan in East Java, in which we own a 49% equity interest and whose first phase we plan to commission by the end of 2023. The government intends to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix, aiming to meet a target of 23% of domestic energy demand by 2025, and announced its intention to reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by 26% by 2020. Under the current local regulation, the tariff policy for geothermal PPAs is mainly determined based on the location of the relevant power plant.
 
We consider Indonesia an important geothermal market, where potential for future development is significant along with an active geothermal industry that is supported by regulatory incentives and commitment from the local government.
 
In addition to project development, we are also pursuing various supply opportunities in Indonesia, and in other countries in Southeast Asia, including several optimization projects.
 
    25 

  

China
 
In China, where we supplied our equipment to one of our clients’ geothermal projects, the National Energy Administration will adopt the 14th Renewable Energy Development Five Year Plan by March 2021 that establishes targets for renewable energy deployment until 2025. Key objectives under the plan include, among others, to increase the share of non-fossil fuel energy in total primary energy consumption to 20% by 2030.
Japan
 
The installed capacity of Japan places ninth in the world, the potential output of 23,470 MW is third in the world after the United States and Indonesia. In 2018, the Japanese government established as its goal a target of 22% to 24% renewable energy of the Japanese energy installed base by 2030. This outlook expects new geothermal plant installation in the range of 380 MW to 850 MW - 1,000 MW. State-owned resources agency JOGMEC will conduct test bores as part of the financially risky early phase of development on behalf of potential developers starting in the fiscal year from April 2020. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) determined 24 successful applicants for the full year 2019 Research Project for Developing Resources for Geothermal Power Generation managed by State-owned resources agency JOGMEC.
East Africa
 
In East Africa the geothermal potential along the Rift Valley is estimated at several thousand MW. The different countries along the Rift Valley are at different stages of development of their respective geothermal potential.
Kenya
 
In Kenya, there are already several geothermal power plants, including our 150 MW Olkaria III complex. The Kenyan government has identified the country's untapped geothermal potential as the most suitable indigenous source of electricity, and it aspires to reach 5 GW of geothermal power generation by 2030.
 
The Kenyan government is aiming to reach 10 GW of power generating capacity by 2037, under the Least-Cost Power Development Plan 2017-37 with a target of 62% of such capacity generated from renewable energy sources (including large hydro and solar). 
 
Other Countries
 
The governments of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zambia are exploring ways to develop geothermal resources in their countries, mostly through the help of international development organizations such as the World Bank.
 
Ethiopia electrification targets for 2025 require additional investment in generation capacities. Such growth in demand was expected to be principally met with the GERD. However, IPP’s are encouraged to participate directly in the renewable development in order to meet expected local growth. Moreover, the current government sees electricity export to neighboring countries as a strategic asset. The country recently completed an interconnection with Kenya and plans to further increase connections to Djibouti, Sudan, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi. These exports will improve foreign exchange reserves in Ethiopia . We hold rights for four geothermal concessions in Ethiopia, for which we have completed initial exploration studies.
 
In January 2014, energy ministers and delegates from 19 countries committed to the creation of the Africa Clean Energy Corridor Initiative (Corridor), at a meeting in Abu Dhabi convened by the International Renewable Energy Agency. The Corridor will boost the deployment of renewable energy and aims to help meet Africa’s rising energy demand with clean, indigenous, cost-effective power from sources including hydro, geothermal, biomass, wind and solar.

Energy Storage
 
Globally, there is a continued increase in the use of renewable energy. In the United States and Europe, this increase is placing strains on the electric grid as adding wind and solar PV power creates situations where a significant amount of power plant capacity must be available to ramp up and down to accommodate wind and mostly solar PV daily output cycles and variations due to atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the output from wind and solar PV power plants can change significantly over short periods of time due to environmental conditions like cloud movement and fog burn off and cause instability on the electric grid. As a result, energy storage is becoming a key component of the future grid.
 
Energy storage systems utilize surplus, available electricity that enables utilities and grid operators to optimize the operation of the grid, run generators closer to full capacity for longer periods, and operate the grid more efficiently and effectively. As penetration of wind and solar resources increases, so does the need for services that energy storage systems can provide to “balance the grid”, such as local capacity, frequency regulation, ramping, reactive power, black start and movement of energy from times of excess supply to times of high demand. Common applications for energy storage systems include ancillary services, wind/solar smoothing, peaker replacement, and transmission and distribution deferral.
 
According to Wood Mackenzie's (formerly GTM Research) Energy Storage Monitor for Q3 2020, approximately 3.3 GWh of new energy storage projects were installed in the United States in 2020 and this number is expected to grow more than seven times to approximately 24.4 GWh in 2025.
 
2020 saw  record growth in BESS deployment in the United States, despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, and significant growth in BESS deployment is expected to continue primarily for  grid-connected (also referred to as “in front of the meter”) applications, but also  for “behind the meter” applications, where end-users, such as small municipal utilities, electric cooperative, educational and health facilities, commercial and industrial customers, benefit from savings through demand charge reductions and create revenues through active market participation. Many power systems are also undergoing significant challenges and changes such as grid aging, grid congestion, retirement of aging generators, implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction rules and increasing penetration of variable renewable energy resources.
 
We own and operate several grid-connected BESS facilities, where revenues come from selling energy, capacity and/or ancillary services in merchant markets like PJM Interconnect, ISO New England, the ERCOT and the CAISO. We are pursuing the development of additional grid-connected BESS projects in multiple regions, with expected revenues coming from providing energy, capacity or ancillary services on a merchant basis,or through bilateral contracts with load serving entities, e.g. investor owned utilities, publicly owned utilities and community choice aggregators. We are also pursuing the development of storage plus Solar PV facilities. We put in place financial instruments, where appropriate, to hedge some of the merchant risk.
 
C&I and Community BESS
 
The electricity industry continues to shift from a purely centralized topology where electricity flows only in one direction from centralized power plants to consumers, into a more distributed architecture, that includes distributed energy resources and consumers selling excess electricity generated on-site to the grid. Many C&I companies, campuses, and communities (e.g. electric cooperatives and small municipal utilities) are motivated to purchase renewable energy to meet sustainability goals and reduce costs. While the C&I industry could be a natural expansion of our customer base, our current  focus is on the much larger and rapidly growing utility-scale front-of-the-meter applications, as well as on utility-scale behind the meter applications. The opportunity is mainly with municipal utilities and electric cooperatives, such as our Hinesburg project with Vermont Electric Cooperative, where one of the revenue streams our BESS generates comes from selling peak load contribution reduction services to the local utility, which allows it to reduce the demand charges paid to the local RTO/ISO.
 
Solar PV
 
The solar PV market continues to grow, driven by constant decline in equipment prices and an increasing desire to replace conventional generation with renewable resources that are commonly supported by favorable regulatory policies.  We are monitoring market drivers with the potential to develop solar PV power plants in locations where we can offer competitively priced power generation. Our current focus is in adding solar PV systems in some of our operating geothermal power plants to reduce internal consumption loads, developing standalone solar PV projects in targeted regions where economics are favorable as well as developing combined solar PV and BESS projects. In 2019 we successfully placed in service a solar PV augmentation system at our Tungsten Mountain geothermal power plant in Churchill County, Nevada. We are also constructing the 20 MW(AC) Wister solar PV project in Imperial County, California, for which a power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric is in effect and we are currently targeting commercial operation in 2021. Additional potential projects are undergoing feasibility analysis, and some are in earlier phases of development.
 
    27 

  

Other Opportunities 

Recovered Energy Generation 

In addition to our geothermal power generation activities, we are pursuing recovered energy-based power generation opportunities in the United States and worldwide. We believe recovered energy-based power generation will ultimately benefit from the efforts to reduce GHG emissions. We have built 23 power plants in North America which generate electricity utilizing “waste heat” from gas turbine-driven compressor stations along interstate natural gas pipelines, from midstream and gas processing facilities, and from other applications.
 
Several states, and to some extent the federal government, have recognized the environmental benefits of recovered energy-based power generation. For example, 18 states currently allow electric utilities to include recovered energy-based power generation in calculating such utilities' compliance with their mandatory or voluntary RPS and/or Energy Efficient Resources Standards. In addition, California modified the Self Generation Incentive Program to allow recovered energy-based power generation to qualify for a per watt incentive. 
 
At the end of 2020, the United States Congress passed legislation including a provision that makes recovered energy generation property eligible for the energy investment tax credit. Recovered energy property that begins construction in 2021 or 2022 is eligible for a 26 percent tax credit, and property that begins construction in 2023 is eligible for a 22 percent tax credit.
 
In Europe, and specifically in Turkey, we see increasing interest in waste heat utilization to generate electricity.
 
In 2016, the Canadian government ratified its commitments in the Paris Agreement, which features a commitment to reduce emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. Pursuant to the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, Canadian provinces must have an emission reduction plan in place or be subject to a federal carbon tax in 2018. 
 
This comprehensive climate policy, once fully implemented, will encourage the development of renewable energy technologies, including waste heat recovery, throughout Canada. We believe that Europe and other markets worldwide may offer similar opportunities in recovered energy-based power generation.
 
In summary, the market for the recovery of waste heat converted into electricity exists either when already available electricity is expensive or where the regulatory environment facilitates construction and marketing of power generated from recovered waste heat. However, such projects tend to be smaller than 9 MW and we expect any growth to be relatively slow and geographically scattered.
 
Operations of our Electricity Segment 
 
How We Own Our Power Plants
 
We customarily establish a separate subsidiary to own interests in each of our power plants. This ensures that the power plant, and the revenues generated by it, will be the only source for repaying indebtedness, if any, incurred to finance the construction or the acquisition (or to refinance the construction or acquisition) of the relevant power plant. If we do not own all of the interest in a power plant, we enter into a shareholders’ agreement or a partnership agreement that governs the management of the specific subsidiary and our relationship with our partner in connection with the specific power plant. Our ability to transfer or sell our interests in certain power plants may be restricted by certain purchase options or rights of first refusal in favor of our power plant partners or the power plant’s power purchasers and/or certain change of control and assignment restrictions in the underlying power plant and financing documents. All of our domestic geothermal and REG power plants are Qualifying Facilities under the PURPA and are eligible for regulatory exemptions from most provisions of the FPA and certain state laws and regulations.
How We Explore and Evaluate Geothermal Resources
 
Since 2006, we have expanded our exploration activities, initially in the United States and in the last few years with an increasing focus internationally. It generally takes two to three years from the time we start active exploration of a particular geothermal resource to the time we have an operating production well, assuming we conclude the resource is commercially viable and determine to pursue its development. Exploration activities generally involve the phases described below.
 
    28 

  

Initial Evaluation
 
We identify and evaluate potential geothermal resources by sampling and studying new areas combined with information available from public and private sources. We generally adhere to the following process, although our process can vary from site to site depending on geological circumstances and prior evaluation:

• | We evaluate historic, geologic and geothermal information available from public and private databases, including geothermal, mining, petroleum and academic sources.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We visit sites, sampling fluids for chemistry if necessary, to evaluate geologic conditions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We evaluate available data, and rank prospects in a database according to estimated size and perceived risk. For example, pre-drilled sites with extensive data are considered lower risk than “green field” sites. Both prospect types are considered critical for our continued growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We generally create a digital, spatial geographic information systems (GIS) database and 3D geologic model containing all pertinent information, including thermal water temperature gradients derived from historic drilling, geologic mapping information (e.g., formations, structure, alteration, and topography), and any available archival information about the geophysical properties of the potential resource.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We assess other relevant information, such as infrastructure (e.g., roads and electric transmission lines), natural features (e.g., springs and lakes), and man-made features (e.g., old mines and wells).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate potential generation capacity using several methods and based on analogous producing geothermal fields. This assessment is refined throughout the exploration process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our initial evaluation is usually conducted by our own staff, although we might engage outside service providers for some tasks from time to time. The costs associated with an initial evaluation vary from site to site, based on various factors, including the acreage involved and the costs, if any, of obtaining information from private databases or other sources. On average, our expenses for an initial evaluation range from approximately $10,000 to $50,000 including travel, chemical analyses, and data acquisition.

If we conclude, based on the information considered in the initial evaluation, that the geothermal resource could support a commercially viable power plant, taking into account various factors described below, we proceed to land rights acquisition.
 
Land Acquisition
 
We acquire land rights to any geothermal resources our initial evaluation indicates could potentially support a commercially viable power plant. For domestic power plants, we either lease or own the sites on which our power plants are located. For our foreign power plants, our lease rights for the power plant site are generally contained in the terms of a concession agreement or other contract with the host government or an agency thereof. In certain cases, we also enter into one or more geothermal resource leases (or subleases) or a concession or an option agreement or other agreement granting us the exclusive right to extract geothermal resources from specified areas of land, with the owners (or sublessors) of such land. In some cases, we first obtain the exploration license and once certain investment requirements are met, we can obtain the geothermal exploitation rights. This usually gives us the right to explore, develop, operate, and maintain the geothermal field, including, among other things, the right to drill wells (and if there are existing wells in the area, to alter them) and build pipelines for transmitting geothermal fluid. In certain cases, the holder of rights in the geothermal resource is a governmental entity and in other cases a private entity. Usually the duration of the lease (or sublease) and concession agreement corresponds to the duration of the relevant PPA, if any. In certain other cases, we own the land where the geothermal resource is located, in which case there are no restrictions on its utilization. The BLM and the Minerals Management Service regulate leasehold interests in federal land in the United States. These agencies have rules governing the geothermal leasing process as discussed below under “Description of Our Leases and Lands”.
 
    29 

  

For most of our current exploration sites in the United States, we acquire rights to use the geothermal resource through land leases with the BLM, with various states, or through private leases. Under these leases, we typically pay an up-front non-refundable bonus payment, which is a component of the competitive lease process. In addition, we undertake to pay nominal, fixed annual rent payments for the period from the commencement of the lease through the completion of construction. Upon the commencement of power generation, we begin to pay to the lessors long-term royalty payments based on the use of the geothermal resources as defined in the respective agreements. These payments are contingent on the power plant’s revenues. A summary of our typical lease terms is provided below under “Description of our Leases and Lands”. The up-front bonus and royalty payments vary from site to site and are based on, among other things, current market conditions.
 
Surveys
 
We conduct geological, geochemical, and/or geophysical surveys on the site we acquire. Following the acquisition of land rights for a potential geothermal resource, we conduct additional surface water analysis, soil surveys, and geologic mapping to determine proximity to possible heat flow anomalies and up-flow/permeable zones. We augment our digital database with the results of those analysis and create conceptual and digital geologic models to describe geothermal system controls. We then initiate a suite of geophysical surveys (e.g., gravity, magnetics, resistivity, magnetotellurics, reflection seismic, LiDAR, and spectral surveys) to assess surface and sub-surface structure (e.g., faults and fractures) and improve the geologic model of fluid-flow conduits and permeability controls. All pertinent geological and geophysical data are used to create three-dimensional geologic models to identify drill locations. These surveys are conducted incrementally considering relative impact and cost, and the geologic model is updated continuously.
 
We make a further determination of the commercial viability of the geothermal resource based on the results of this process, particularly the results of the geochemical surveys estimating temperature and the overall geologic model, including potential resource size. If the results from the geochemical surveys are poor (i.e., low derived resource temperatures or poor permeability) or the geologic model indicates small or deep resource, we re-evaluate the commercial viability of the geothermal resource and may not proceed to exploratory drilling. We generally only move forward with those sites that we believe have a high probability of successful development.
 
Exploratory Drilling
 
We drill one or more exploratory wells on the high priority, relatively low risk sites to confirm and/or define the geothermal resource. If we proceed to exploratory drilling, we generally use outside contractors to create access roads to drilling sites and related activities. We have continued efforts to reduce exploration costs and therefore, after obtaining drilling permits, we generally drill temperature gradient holes and/or core holes that are lower cost than slim holes (used in the past) using either our own drilling equipment, whenever possible, or outside contractors. If the obtained data supports a conclusion that the geothermal resource can support a commercially viable power plant, it will be used as an observation well to monitor and define the geothermal resource. If the core hole indicates low temperatures or does not support the geologic model of anticipated permeability, it may be plugged, and the area reclaimed. In undrilled sites, we typically step up from shallow (500-1000 feet) to deeper (2000-4000 feet) wells as confidence improves. Following proven temperature in core wells, we typically move to slim and/or full- size wells to quantify permeability.
 
Each year we determine and approve an exploration budget for the entire exploration activity in such year. We prioritize budget allocation between the various geothermal sites based on commercial and geological factors. The costs we incur for exploratory drilling vary from site to site based on various factors, including the accessibility of the drill site, the geology of the site, and the depth of the resource. However, on average, exploration costs, prior to drilling of a full-size well are approximately $1.0 million to $3.0 million for each site, not including land acquisition. We only reach such spending levels for sites that proved to be successful in the early stages of exploration.
 
    30 

  

At various points during our exploration activities, we re-assess whether the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant based on information available at that time. Among other things, we consider the following factors:
 

• | New data and interpretations obtained concerning the geothermal resource as our exploration activities proceed, and particularly the expected MW capacity power plant the resource can be expected to support. The MW capacity can be estimated using analogous systems and/or quantitative heat in place estimates until results from drilling and flow tests quantify temperature, permeability, and resulting resource size.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current and expected market conditions and rates for contracted and merchant electric power in the market(s) to be serviced.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability of transmission capacity.
--+---------------------------------------


• | Anticipated costs associated with further exploration activities and the relative risk of failure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anticipated costs for design and construction of a power plant at the site.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anticipated costs for operation of a power plant at the site, particularly taking into account the ability to share certain types of costs (such as control rooms) with one or more other power plants that are, or are expected to be, operating near the site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we conclude that the geothermal resource involved will support a commercially viable power plant, we proceed to constructing a power plant at the site.
 
How We Construct Our Power Plants. 
 
The principal phases involved in constructing one of our geothermal power plants are as follows:
 

• | Drilling production and injection wells.
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Designing the well field, power plant, equipment, controls, and transmission facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtaining any required permits, electrical interconnection and transmission agreements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing (or in the case of equipment we do not manufacture ourselves, purchasing) the equipment required for the power plant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembling and constructing the well field, power plant, transmission facilities, and related facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In recent years, it has taken us two to three years from the time we drill a production well until the power plant becomes operational.
 
Drilling Production and Injection Wells 
 
We consider completing the drilling of the first production well to be the beginning of our construction phase for a power plant. However, this is not always sufficient for a full release of a project for construction. The number of production wells varies from plant to plant depending on, among other things, the geothermal resource, the projected capacity of the power plant, the power generation equipment to be used and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected through injection wells to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions. We generally drill the wells ourselves although in some cases we use outside contractors.
 
The cost for each production and injection well varies depending on, among other things, the depth and size of the well and market conditions affecting the supply and demand for drilling equipment, labor and operators. In the last five years, our typical cost for each production and injection well is approximately $3.3 million with a range of $1.0 million to $8.5 million.

    31 

  

Design
 
We usually use our own employees to design the well field and the power plant, including equipment that we manufacture and that will be needed for the power plant. In some cases, depending on complexity and location, we use third parties to help us with the design. The designs vary based on various factors, including local laws, required permits, the geothermal resource, the expected capacity of the power plant and the way geothermal fluids will be re-injected to maintain the geothermal resource and surface conditions.
Permits
 
We use our own employees and from time to time, depending on complexity and location, outside consultants to obtain any required permits and licenses for our power plants that are not already covered by the terms of our site leases. The permits and licenses required vary from site to site and are described below under “Environmental Permits”.
Manufacturing
 
Generally, we manufacture most of the power generating unit equipment we use at our power plants. Multiple sources of supply are generally available for all other equipment we do not manufacture.
Construction
 
We use our own employees to manage the construction work. For site grading, civil, mechanical, and electrical work we use subcontractors.
 
During 2020, in the Electricity segment, we focused on the commencement of operations at Steamboat Hills Repower in Nevada and we also began construction of CD4, Dixie Meadows and Tungsten Mountain enhancement as well as with enhancement work in some other of our operating power plants worldwide. 
 
When deciding whether to continue holding lease rights and/or to pursue exploration activity, we diligently prioritize our prospective investments, taking into account resource and probability assessments in order to make informed decisions about whether a particular project will support commercial operation. As a result, during fiscal year 2020 we decided to discontinue our holding in one site in Nevada.
 
After conducting exploratory studies at those sites, we concluded that the respective geothermal resources would not support commercial operations. Costs associated with exploration activities at these sites were expensed accordingly (see “Write-off of Unsuccessful Exploration Activities” under Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”).
 
We added to our exploration inventory two prospective sites in 2020.
 
How We Operate and Maintain Our Power Plants 
 
Our operations and maintenance practices are designed to minimize operating costs without compromising safety or environmental standards while maximizing plant flexibility and maintaining high reliability. Our operations and maintenance practices for geothermal power plants seek to preserve the sustainable characteristics of the geothermal resources we use to produce electricity and maintain steady-state operations within the constraints of those resources reflected in our relevant geologic and hydrologic studies. Our approach to plant management emphasizes the operational autonomy of our individual plant or complex managers and staff to identify and resolve operations and maintenance issues at their respective power plants; however, each power plant or complex draws upon our available collective resources and experience, and that of our subsidiaries. We have organized our operations such that inventories, maintenance, backup, and other operational functions are pooled within each power plant complex and provided by one operation and maintenance provider. This approach enables us to realize cost savings and enhances our ability to meet our power plant availability goals.

    32 

  

Safety is a key area of concern to us. We believe that the most efficient and profitable performance of our power plants can only be accomplished within a safe working environment for our employees. Our compensation and incentive program include safety as a factor in evaluating our employees, and we have a well-developed reporting system to track safety and environmental incidents, if any, at our power plants.
    How We Sell Electricity 
 
In the United States, the purchasers of power from our power plants are typically investor-owned electric utility companies or electric cooperatives including public owned utilities and recently we signed a PPA with CCAs. Outside of the United States, our purchasers are either state-owned utilities or privately-owned-entities and we typically operate our facilities under rights granted to us by a governmental agency pursuant to a concession agreement. In each case, we enter into long-term contracts (typically, PPAs) for the sale of electricity or the conversion of geothermal resources into electricity. Although previously our power plants’ revenues under a PPA generally consisted of two payments, energy payments and capacity payments, our recent PPAs provide for energy payments only. Energy payments are normally based on a power plant’s electrical output actually delivered to the purchaser measured in kWh, with payment rates either fixed or indexed to the power purchaser’s “avoided” power costs (i.e., the costs the power purchaser would have incurred itself had it produced the power it is purchasing from third parties) or rates that escalate at a predetermined percentage each year. Capacity payments are normally calculated based on the generating capacity or the declared capacity of a power plant available for delivery to the purchaser, regardless of the amount of electrical output actually produced or delivered. In addition, we have six domestic power plants located in California, Nevada and Hawaii that are eligible for capacity bonus payments under the respective PPAs upon reaching certain levels of generation, or subject to a capacity payment reduction if certain levels of generation are not reached.
How We Finance Our Power Plants 
 
Historically we have funded our power plants with different sources of liquidity such as a non-recourse or limited recourse debt, lease financing, tax monetization transactions, internally generated cash, which includes funds from operation, as well as proceeds from loans under corporate credit facilities, public equity offerings, senior unsecured corporate bonds, and the sale of equity interests and other securities. Such leveraged financing permits the development of power plants with a limited amount of equity contributions, but also increases the risk that a reduction in revenues could adversely affect a particular power plant’s ability to meet its debt obligations. Leveraged financing also means that distributions of dividends or other distributions by our power plant subsidiaries to us are contingent on compliance with financial and other covenants contained in the applicable financing documents.
 
Non-recourse debt or lease financing refers to debt or lease arrangements involving debt repayments or lease payments that are made solely from the power plant’s revenues (rather than our revenues or revenues of any other power plant) and generally are secured by the power plant’s physical assets, major contracts and agreements, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in our affiliate that owns that power plant. These forms of financing are referred to as “project financing”.
 
In the event of a foreclosure after a default, our affiliate that owns the power plant would only retain an interest in the power plant assets, if any, remaining after all debts and obligations have been paid in full. In addition, incurrence of debt by a power plant may reduce the liquidity of our equity interest in that power plant because the equity interest is typically subject both to a pledge in favor of the power plant’s lenders securing the power plant’s debt and to transfer and change of control restrictions set forth in the relevant financing agreements.
 
Limited recourse debt refers to project financing as described above with the addition of our agreement to undertake limited financial support for our affiliate that owns the power plant in the form of certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities. These obligations and contingent liabilities may take the form of guarantees of certain specified obligations, indemnities, capital infusions and agreements to pay certain debt service deficiencies. Creditors of a project financing of a particular power plant may have direct recourse to us to the extent of these limited recourse obligations.
 
    33 

  

In 2020, we completed an equity offering, issued senior unsecured corporate bonds and raised corporate credit facilities to support our geothermal and storage growth.
 
We have used financing structures to monetize PTCs and depreciation, such as our tax equity partnership transaction involving McGinness Hills phase 3, Tungsten, and an operating lease arrangement relating to our Puna complex power plants that was recently retired in 2019.
 
We have also used a sale of equity interests in three of our geothermal assets and nine of our REG facilities to fund corporate needs including funding for the construction of new projects. We may use some of the same financing structures in the future.

How We Mitigate International Political Risk. 
 
We generally purchase insurance policies to cover our equity exposure to certain political risks involved in operating in developing countries, as described below under “Insurance”. However, insurance may not cover all political risks or coverage amounts may not be sufficient.
Description of Our Leases and Lands 
 
We have domestic leases on approximately 338,123 acres of federal, state, and private land in California, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah Idaho and Oregon. The approximate breakdown between federal, state and private leases and owned land is as follows:

• | 78% of the acreage under our control is leased from the U.S. government, acting mainly through the BLM;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 18% is leased or subleased from private landowners and/or leaseholders;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2% is owned by us; and
--+-----------------------


• | 2% is leased from various states.
--+----------------------------------

 
Each of the leases within each of the categories above has standard terms and requirements, as summarized below. Internationally, our land position includes approximately 60,903 acres.
 
BLM Geothermal Leases
 
Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with the U.S. government, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on federally-owned land. These leases are made pursuant to the Geothermal Steam Act and the lessor under such leases is the U.S. government, acting through the BLM.
 
BLM geothermal leases grant the geothermal lessee the right and privilege to drill for, extract, produce, remove, utilize, sell, and dispose of geothermal resources on certain lands, together with the right to build and maintain necessary improvements thereon. The actual ownership of the geothermal resources and other minerals beneath the land is retained in the federal mineral estate. The geothermal lease does not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to develop the lands, although the geothermal lessee does hold the exclusive right to develop geothermal resources within the lands. Since BLM leases do not grant to the geothermal lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, BLM may grant rights to others for activities that do not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee’s uses of the same land, including use, off-road vehicles, and/or wind or solar energy developments.
 
Typical BLM leases issued to geothermal lessees before August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years and will renew so long as geothermal resources are being produced or utilized in commercial quantities but cannot exceed a period of forty years after the end of the primary term. If at the end of the forty-year period geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease for a second forty-year term, under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate.
 
    34 

  

BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005 have a primary term of ten years. If the geothermal lessee does not reach commercial production within the primary term, the BLM may grant two five-year extensions. If the lessee is drilling a well for the purposes of commercial production, the lease may be extended for five years and thereafter as long as steam is being produced and used in commercial quantities the lease may be extended for up to thirty-five years. If, at the end of the extended thirty-five-year term, geothermal steam is still being produced or utilized in commercial quantities and the lands are not needed for other purposes, the geothermal lessee will have a preferential right to renew the lease under terms and conditions as the BLM deems appropriate.
 
For BLM leases issued before August 8, 2005, the geothermal lessee is required to pay an annual rental fee (on a per acre basis), which escalates according to a schedule described therein, until production of geothermal steam in commercial quantities has commenced. After such production has commenced, the geothermal lessee is required to pay royalties (on a monthly basis) on the amount or value of (i) steam, (ii) by-products derived from production, and (iii) commercially de-mineralized water sold or utilized by the project (or reasonably susceptible to such sale or use).
 
For BLM leases issued after August 8, 2005, (i) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a non-competitive bidding process will pay an annual rental fee equal to $1.00 per acre for the first ten years and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter; and (ii) a geothermal lessee who has obtained a lease through a competitive process will pay a rental equal to $2.00 per acre for the first year, $3.00 per acre for the second through tenth year and $5.00 per acre each year thereafter. Rental fees paid before the first day of the year for which the rental is owed will be credited towards royalty payments for that year. For BLM leases issued, effective, or pending on August 5, 2005 or thereafter, royalty rates are fixed between 1.0-2.5% of the gross proceeds from the sale of electricity during the first ten years of production under the lease. The royalty rate set by the BLM for geothermal resources produced for the commercial generation of electricity but not sold in an arm’s length transaction is 1.75% for the first ten years of production and 3.5% thereafter. The royalty rate for geothermal resources sold by the geothermal lessee or an affiliate in an arm’s length transaction is 10.0% of the gross proceeds from the arm’s length sale.
 
In the event of a default under any BLM lease, or the failure to comply with any of the provisions of the Geothermal Steam Act or regulations issued under the Geothermal Steam Act or the terms or stipulations of the lease, the BLM may, 30 days after notice of default is provided to the relevant project, (i) suspend operations until the requested action is taken, or (ii) cancel the lease.
 
Private Geothermal Leases
 
Certain of our domestic project subsidiaries have entered into geothermal resources leases with private parties, pursuant to which they have obtained the right to conduct their geothermal development and operations on privately owned land. In many cases, the lessor under these private geothermal leases owns only the geothermal resource and not the surface of the land.
 
Typically, the leases grant our project subsidiaries the exclusive right and privilege to drill for, produce, extract, take and remove from the leased land water, brine, steam, steam power, minerals (other than oil), salts, chemicals, gases (other than gases associated with oil), and other products produced or extracted by such project subsidiary. The project subsidiaries are also granted certain non-exclusive rights pertaining to the construction and operation of plants, structures, and facilities on the leased land. Additionally, the project subsidiaries are granted the right to dispose geothermal fluid as well as the right to re-inject into the leased land water, brine, steam, and gases in a well or wells for the purpose of maintaining or restoring pressure in the productive zones beneath the leased land or other land in the vicinity. Because the private geothermal leases do not grant to the lessee the exclusive right to use the surface of the land, the lessor reserves the right to conduct other activities on the leased land in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the geothermal lessee’s uses of the same land, which other activities may include agricultural use (farming or grazing), recreational use and hunting, and/or wind or solar energy developments.
 
The leases provide for a term consisting of a primary term in the range of five to 30 years, depending on the lease, and so long thereafter as lease products are being produced or the project subsidiary is engaged in drilling, extraction, processing, or reworking operations on the leased land.
 
As consideration under most of our project subsidiaries’ private leases, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor a certain specified percentage of the value “at the well” (which is not attributable to the enhanced value of electricity generation), gross proceeds, or gross revenues of all lease products produced, saved, and sold on a monthly basis. In certain of our project subsidiaries’ private leases, royalties payable to the lessor by the project subsidiary are based on the gross revenues received by the lessee from the sale or use of the geothermal substances, either from electricity production or the value of the geothermal resource “at the well”.
 
    35 

  

In addition, pursuant to the leases, the project subsidiary typically agrees to commence drilling, extraction or processing operations on the leased land within the primary term, and to conduct such operations with reasonable diligence until lease products have been found, extracted and processed in quantities deemed “paying quantities” by the project subsidiary, or until further operations would, in such project subsidiary’s judgment, be unprofitable or impracticable. The project subsidiary has the right at any time within the primary term to terminate the lease and surrender the relevant land. If the project subsidiary has not commenced any such operations on said land (or on the unit area, if the lease has been unitized), or terminated the lease within the primary term, the project subsidiary must pay to the lessor, in order to maintain its lease position, annually in advance, a rental fee until operations are commenced on the leased land.
 
If the project subsidiary fails to pay any installment of royalty or rental when due and if such default continues for a period of fifteen days specified in the lease, for example, after its receipt of written notice thereof from the lessor, then at the option of the lessor, the lease will terminate as to the portion or portions thereof as to which the project subsidiary is in default. If the project subsidiary defaults in the performance of any obligations under the lease, other than a payment default, and if, for a period of 90 days after written notice is given to it by the lessor of such default, the project subsidiary fails to commence and thereafter diligently and in good faith take remedial measures to remedy such default, the lessor may terminate the lease.
 
We do not regard any property that we lease as material unless and until we begin construction of a power plant on the property, that is, until we drill a production well on the property.

(6)On May 3, 2018, the Kilauea volcano located in close proximity to our Puna 38 MW geothermal power plant in the Puna district of Hawaii's Big Island erupted following a significant increase in seismic activity in the area. The power plant was shut down immediately and resumed partial operation in November 2020. We plan to continue drilling and workovers and get back to full operation by mid-2021. In 2019, we reached an agreement with HELCO and signed a new PPA that was filed with the local PUC for approval. The new PPA extends the current term until 2052 and increases the current contract capacity by 8 MW to 46MW. In addition, the new PPA has a fixed price with no escalation, regardless of changes to fossil fuel pricing, which impacts the majority of our current pricing under the existing PPA.

Future Projects 
 
Projects Released for Construction 
 
We have several projects in various stages of construction, including six projects that we have fully released for construction and one project that is in the early stage of construction. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and other factors, we saw continuous delays in getting all relevant permits and as a result we are seeing continuous delays in the expected COD.
 
These projects are expected to have a total geothermal generating capacity between 82 MW and 87 MW (representing our interest) and one solar PV projects with a total of 20 MW .

Projects under Various Stages of Development that were not Released for Construction
 
We also have projects under various stages of development in the United States and Guadeloupe. We expect to continue to explore these and other opportunities for expansion so long as they continue to meet our business objectives and investment criteria.
 
The following is a description of the projects currently under various stages of development and for which we are able to estimate their expected generating capacity. Upon completion of these projects, the generating capacity of our geothermal projects would increase by approximately between 68 MW to 73 MW (representing our interest) and solar PV projects with a total of 20 MW . However, we prioritize our investments based on their readiness for continued construction and expected economics and therefore we are not planning to invest in all of such projects in 2021.

Future Prospects
 
We have a substantial land position that is expected to support future development and on which we have started or plan to start exploration activity. When deciding whether to continue holding lease rights and/or to pursue exploration activity, we diligently prioritize our prospective investments, taking into account resource and probability assessments in order to make informed decisions about whether a particular project will support commercial operation.
 
During fiscal year 2020, we discontinued holding a lease at one prospect at Mary's River, Nevada and we moved one prospect to construction (Tungsten Mountain 2) and one prospect (North Valley) to development. In 2019 we discontinued holding two prospects at Glamis, California and at Lake View, Oregon. We added three new prospects in 2020, in the United States and Indonesia.

Operations of our Product Segment 
 
Power Units for Geothermal Power Plants
 
We design, manufacture, and sell power units for geothermal electricity generation, which we refer to as OECs. Our customers include contractors and geothermal plant owners and operators.
 
The power units are usually paid for in installments, in accordance with milestones set forth in the supply agreement. We also provide the purchaser with spare parts (either upon their request or our recommendation). We provide the purchaser with at least a 12-month warranty for such products. We provide the purchaser with performance guarantees (usually in the form of standby letters of credit), which partially terminates upon delivery of the equipment to the site and terminates in full at the end of the warranty period.
 
Power Units for Recovered Energy-Based Power Generation
 
We design, manufacture, and sell power units used to generate electricity from recovered energy or so-called “waste heat”. Our existing and target customers include interstate natural gas pipeline owners and operators, gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators, and other companies engaged in other energy-intensive industrial processes. We manufacture and sell the power units for recovered energy-based power generation to third parties for use in “inside-the-fence” installations or otherwise. Our customers include gas processing plant owners and operators, cement plant owners and operators and companies in the process industry.
 
    42 

  

Remote Power Units and other Generators
 
We design, manufacture and sell fossil fuel powered turbo-generators with capacities ranging from 200 watts to 5,000 watts, which operate unattended in extreme hot or cold climate conditions. The remote power units supply energy to remote unmanned installations and along communications lines and provide cathodic protection along gas and oil pipelines. Our customers include contractors installing gas pipelines in remote areas. In addition, we manufacture and sell generators, including heavy duty direct current generators, for various other uses. The terms for sale of the turbo-generators are similar to those for the power units we produce for power plants.
 
EPC of Power Plants
 
We engineer, procure and construct, as an EPC contractor, geothermal and recovered energy power plants on a turnkey basis, using power units we design and manufacture. Our customers are geothermal power plant owners as well as our target customers for the sale of our recovered-energy based power units described above. Unlike many other companies that provide EPC services, we believe that our advantage is in using our own manufactured equipment and thus have better quality and control over the timing and delivery of equipment and related costs. The consideration for such services is usually paid in installments, in accordance with milestones set forth in the EPC contract and related documents. We provide performance guarantees (usually in the form of standby letters of credit) securing our obligations under the contract.
 
In connection with the sale of our power units for geothermal power plants, power units for recovered energy-based power generation, remote power units and other generators, we enter into sales agreements, from time to time, with sales representatives for the marketing and sale of such products pursuant to which we are obligated to pay commissions to such representatives upon the sale of our products in the relevant territory covered by such agreements by such representatives or, in some cases, by other representatives in such territory.
 
Our manufacturing operations and products are certified ISO 9001, ISO 14001, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and TÜV, and we are an approved supplier to many electric utilities around the world.
 
Backlog 
 
We have a product backlog of approximately $33.4 million as of February 24, 2021, which includes revenues for the period between January 1, 2021 and February 24, 2021, compared to $141.9 million as of February 25, 2020, which included revenues for the period between January 1, 2020 and February 25, 2020. The reduction in 2021 backlog is mainly related to the impact of COVID 19 on our business as described in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
The following is a breakdown of the Product segment backlog amount (in $ millions) by countries as of February 24, 2021:

Energy Storage Pipeline
 
For an energy storage prospect to move into the EPC phase, it requires site control, an executed interconnection agreement, permits from all authorities and a viable financial model. We have a substantial pipeline of approximately 1.2 GW of projects in different stages of development for future development in the United States that we expect to commission between 200 MW and 300 MW by 2023.
Competition 
 
     Electricity Segment
 
In our Electricity segment, we face competition from geothermal power plant owners and developers as well as other renewable energy providers and developers.
 
Competition in the Electricity segment occurs in the very early stage of development and in advanced stages when obtaining a PPA. The early stage is primarily obtaining the rights to the resource for development of future projects or acquiring a site already in a more advanced stage of development. From time to time and in different jurisdictions competing geothermal developers become our customers in the Product segment.
 
    44 

  

Our main competitors in the geothermal sector in the United States are CalEnergy, Calpine Corporation, Terra-Gen Power LLC, Enel Green Power S.p.A., Cyrq Energy Inc. and other smaller pure play developers. Outside the United States, in many cases our competitors are companies that are gaining experience developing geothermal projects in their own countries such as Mercury (formerly Mighty River Power) and Contact Energy in New Zealand, Energy Development Corporation from the Philippines and Enel Green Power from Italy. Some Turkish developers are also focusing on the international market. Additionally, we face competition from country-specific companies and smaller pure play geothermal developers.
 
In obtaining new PPAs, we also face competition from companies engaged in the power generation business from other renewable energy sources, such as wind power, biomass, solar power and hydroelectric power. In the United States we primarily compete against solar power generation combined with energy storage. We also face competition from existing geothermal power plants as they are re-contracted.
 
As a geothermal company, we are focused on niche markets where our baseload and flexibility advantages can allow us to develop competitive projects.
 
  Product Segment 
 
In our Product segment, we face competition from power plant equipment manufacturers and system integrators as well as engineering or project management companies.
 
Our competitors among power plant equipment suppliers are divided by technology, steam turbines and binary power plant manufacturers. Our main steam turbine competitors are industrial steam turbine manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation of Japan, GE/Nuovo Pignone and Ansaldo Energia of Italy.
 
Our binary technology competitors are binary systems manufacturers using the ORC such as Fuji Electric Co., Ltd of Japan, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries through Turboden, TICA, a Chinese air conditioning company that acquired Italian Exergy, Egesim, a Turkish electrical contractor who is collaborating with Atlas Copco mainly in the Turkish market and internationally, and Kaishan, a compressor manufacturer from China who develops its own projects. While we believe that we have a distinct competitive advantage based on our accumulated experience and current worldwide share of installed binary generation capacity (which is approximately 82%), an increase in competition, which we are currently experiencing, has started to affect our ability to secure new purchase orders from potential customers. The increased competition led to a reduction in the prices that we are able to charge for our binary equipment, which in turn impacted our profitability.
 
In the REG business, our competitors are other ORC manufacturers (such as GE, Exergy and Mitsubishi/Turboden), manufacturers that use Kalina technology (such as Geothermal Energy Research & Development Co., Ltd in Japan), other manufacturers of conventional steam turbines and small developers of small scale ORCs.
 
Currently, none of our competitors competes with us in both the Electricity and the Product segments.
 
In the case of proposed EPC projects we also compete with other service suppliers, such as project/engineering companies or EPC contractors.
 
Energy Storage Segment
 
In our Energy Storage segment, we face significant competition from companies that already have established businesses in those technologies and markets as well as companies seeking to acquire established businesses and other new market entrants like us.
 
In the demand response markets, our Viridity business competes primarily with specialized demand management providers and traditional curtailment service providers. Viridity differentiates itself from its competitors by its proprietary software and analytical strengths, wider use cases, customer base, business model, and market presence.
 
The energy storage space is comprised of many companies divided into different verticals and sub verticals like independent power producers, project developers, system integrators, EPC contractors , component suppliers (e.g. batteries, inverters, control software, and balance of plant), scheduling coordinators, etc. Our proprietary software, analytical operational platform and experience in energy storage operation and integration with electricity markets, as well as our engineering and system integration capabilities, allow us to provide multiple value streams (commonly referred to as value stacking) from a single storage installation. We have continued and plan to continue to grow our energy storage business in these markets.

Customers 
 
All of our revenues from the sale of Electricity in the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from fully-contracted energy and/or capacity payments under long-term PPAs with governmental, public or private utility entities. The percentage of total revenues above 5% is detailed in the table below:

Utility | % of total revenues for the year ended
-------------------+---------------------------------------
 | December 31, 2020 
SCPPA (U.S.) | 20.6% 
NV Energy (U.S.) | 17.5% 
KPLC (Kenya) | 16.4% 

 
Based on publicly available information, as of December 31, 2020, the credit ratings of our rated electric utility customers are as set forth below:
 

Issuer | Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services | Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
-----------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------
Southern California Edison | BBB (Negative) | Baa2 (Stable) 
HELCO | BBB- (Positive) | Ratings withdrawn 
Sierra Pacific Power Company | A (Stable) | Baa1 (Stable) 
Nevada Power Company | A (Stable) | Baa1 (Stable) 
SCPPA | BBB+ (Stable) | (Stable) 
PG&E | BB- (Negative) | B1 (Stable) 
EDF | BBB+ (Stable) | A3 (Negative) 

 
The credit ratings of any power purchaser may change from time to time. There is no publicly available information with respect to the credit rating or stability of the power purchasers under the PPAs for our foreign power plants other than EDF (France).
 
While we have historically been able to collect on substantially all of our receivable balances, we have received late payments and have amounts overdue from KPLC in Kenya related to our Olkaria III Complex and from ENEE in Honduras related to our Platanares power plant. We believe we will be able to collect all past due amounts.
 
Our revenues from the Product segment are derived from contractors, owners, or operators of power plants, process companies, and pipelines.
 
Our revenues from the Energy Storage segment is derived from selling energy, capacity and/or ancillary services in merchant markets like PJM, ISO New England, ERCOT and CAISO. We are pursuing the projects that will serve entities, such as investor owned utilities, publicly owned utilities and community choice aggregators.
 
Raw Materials, Suppliers and Subcontractors 
 
In connection with our manufacturing activities, we use raw materials such as steel and aluminum. We do not rely on any one supplier for the raw materials used in our manufacturing activities, as all of these raw materials are readily available from various suppliers.
 
We use subcontractors for some of the manufacturing activities with respect to our products components and for construction activities with respect to our power plants, which allows us to expand our construction and development capacity on an as-needed basis. We are not dependent on any one subcontractor and expect to be able to replace any subcontractor or assume such manufacturing and construction activities ourselves, if necessary or desirable, without adverse effect to our operations.
 
    46 

  

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,402 employees, of whom 572 were located in Israel, 585 were located in the United States and 245 were located in other countries. We expect that any material future growth in the number of our employees will be generally attributable to the purchase or development of new power plants and energy storage facilities.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the only employees that are represented by a labor union are the employees of our acquired Bouillante power plant located in Guadeloupe. The employees in Guadeloupe are represented by the Confédération Générale du Travail de Guadeloupe. We have never experienced any labor dispute, strike or work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are positive.
 
We have no collective bargaining agreements with respect to our Israeli employees. However, by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement between the Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (which includes the Industrialists Association) may apply to some of our Israeli non-managerial, finance and administrative, and sales and marketing personnel. This collective bargaining agreement principally concerns cost of living pay increases, length of the workday, minimum wages and insurance for work-related accidents, annual and other vacation, sick pay, and determination of severance pay, pension contributions, and other conditions of employment. We currently provide such employees with benefits and working conditions, which are at least as favorable as the conditions specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 
We believe that our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees, focusing on safety, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting a diverse workforce, adopting forward thinking human capital management practices and community outreach are critical elements of our corporate strategy.
 

● | Investing in our Employees. We strive to provide employees at all levels with benefits that express our level of appreciation and care for employee well-being.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Safety. The health and safety of our employees, subcontractors, the public and the environment is an overarching priority for us. We manage risks by identifying, assessing and managing risks in our facilities and offices that we own and operate. We promote safety awareness and values and our goal is to report, analyze, learn and improve performance in order to reduce the number of incidents. We also work to continuously improve our safety performance and to instill a workplace safety culture. We also conduct quality, environment, health and safety audits of our plants and facilities on a periodic basis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Compensation and Benefits. We strive to ensure that our employees receive fair and competitive compensation and benefits, including, for most of our employees, paid maternity or paternity leave, sponsorship of learning opportunities, health care insurance, sick leave benefits and coverage in the event of disability and/or infirmity, among others. At times, benefits are made available to part-time and temporary employees as well. All our global employees are entitled to retirement and pension benefits at or beyond the legally required level of employer contribution in the relevant country of operation, including access to 401(k) plans in the U.S. We fully cover retirement and pension plan liabilities in relevant countries of operation with our general resources. All current employees in Israel who are entitled to benefits in the event of termination or retirement in accordance with the Israeli Government sponsored programs are provided with limited non-pension benefits.

● | Diversity Initiatives. We strive to provide a diverse and inclusive working environment, where people are respected and feel a sense of belonging regardless of their race, nationality, gender, age, religion or sexual orientation. Our offices, manufacturing plants and power plants are in multiple jurisdictions and our global workforce operates across many different beliefs. We are committed to local employment at all our operational and manufacturing locations. While our first and foremost consideration of a potential candidate is professional skills and overall qualifications for the position, we work with several organizations in the U.S. to help us present opportunities to ethnic minorities and veterans for open positions. Furthermore, we are committed to eliminating any form of discrimination in our hiring and employment termination practices and ensuring that all employees are adequately accommodated and treated equally. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employee Development. We focus on creating opportunities for employee education, development and training. Our training opportunities include relevant professional as well as soft skills to help our employees improve their performance and expand their horizons. We have annual performance reviews for most of our employees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we acted quickly to put social distancing mechanisms in place to protect our employees while maintaining and enhancing business activity during this global crisis. We did not lay off any employees due the Covid-19 Pandemic, except for in the ordinary course of business. We also launched an outreach plan to support communities where we do business such as addressing the reduced availability of food to vulnerable populations and providing medical and personal protective equipment to local communities’ healthcare workers across the globe. Throughout this global pandemic, we will continue following stringent protective measures necessary to safeguard the health, and safety of our employees. This includes adhering to all government regulations and maintaining clear, comprehensive plans and protective measures for employees who work in our energy plants, manufacturing facilities, offices and elsewhere.

Insurance 
 
We maintain physical damage and business interruption insurance, including the perils of flood, volcanic eruption, earthquake and windstorm, cyber coverage, general and excess liability, pollution legal liability, control of well, drilling rigs, construction risks, as well as customary worker’s compensation and automobile, marine transportation insurance and such other commercially available insurance as is generally carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties in the same general areas as us. Such insurance covering our properties extends to Ormat and/or our owned, controlled, direct or indirect affiliated or associated companies, subsidiary companies or corporations in amounts generally based upon the estimated replacement value and maximum foreseeable loss of our facilities (provided that certain perils including earthquake, volcanic eruption and flood coverage may be subject to sublimit and/or annual aggregate limits depending on the type and location of the facility) and business interruption insurance coverage in an amount that also varies from location to location.
 
We purchase certain insurance policies to cover our equity exposure to specified political risks involved in operating in developing countries. We hold a global political risk insurance program covering the significant political risks at certain of our locations. This program is issued by the global insurers in the private sector. Such insurance policies generally cover, subject to the limitations and restrictions contained therein, losses derived from a specified governmental act, such as expropriation, political violence, and the inability to convert local currency into hard currency and, in certain cases, the breach of agreements with governmental entities, in approximately 90% of our book net equity investment.
 
Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in the United States
 
The following is a summary overview of the electric utility industry and applicable federal and state regulations and should not be considered a full statement of the law or all issues pertaining thereto.
 
PURPA
 
PURPA and FERC's regulations thereunder exempt owners of small power production Qualifying Facilities that use geothermal resources as their primary source and other Qualifying Facilities that are 30 MW or under in size from regulation under the PUHCA 2005, from many provisions of the FPA and from state laws relating to the financial, organization and rate regulation of electric utilities.
 
PURPA provides the owners of power plants certain benefits described below if a power plant is a “Qualifying Facility.” A small power production facility is a Qualifying Facility if: (i) the facility does not exceed 80 MW; (ii) the primary energy source of the facility is biomass, waste, geothermal, or renewable resources, or any combination thereof, and at least 75% of the total energy input of the facility is from these sources, and fossil fuel input is limited to specified uses; and (iii) the facility, if larger than one megawatt, has filed with FERC a notice of self-certification of qualifying status, or has been certified as a Qualifying Facility by FERC. The 80 MW size limitation, however, does not apply to a facility if (i) it produces electric energy solely by the use, as a primary energy input, of solar, wind, waste or geothermal resources; and (ii) an application for certification or a notice of self-certification of qualifying status of the facility was submitted to not later than December 31, 1994, and construction of the facility commenced not later than December 31, 1999.
 
With respect to the FPA, FERC's regulations under PURPA do not exempt from the rate provisions of the FPA sales of energy or capacity from Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size that are made (a) pursuant to a contract executed after March 17, 2006 or (b) not pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. The practical effect of these regulations is to require owners of Qualifying Facilities that are larger than 20 MW in size to obtain market-based rate authority from FERC if they seek to sell energy or capacity other than pursuant to a contract executed on or before March 17, 2006 or pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. A sale to a public utility under PURPA at state approved avoided cost rates is generally exempt from FERC rate regulation.
 
In addition, provided that the purchasing electric utility has not been relieved from its mandatory purchase obligation, PURPA and FERC’s regulations under PURPA obligate electric utilities to purchase energy and capacity from Qualifying Facilities at either the electric utility’s avoided cost or a negotiated rate. FERC's regulations under PURPA allow FERC, upon request of a utility, to terminate a utility’s obligation to purchase energy from Qualifying Facilities upon a finding that Qualifying Facilities have nondiscriminatory access to: (i) independently administered, auction-based day ahead, and real time markets for electric energy and wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; (ii) transmission and interconnection services provided by a FERC-approved regional transmission entity and administered under an open-access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers, and competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term, and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the Qualifying Facility is interconnected; or (iii) wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are at a minimum of comparable competitive quality as markets described in (i) and (ii) above. FERC regulations protect a Qualifying Facility’s rights under any contract or obligation involving purchases or sales that are entered into before FERC has determined that the contracting utility is entitled to relief from the mandatory purchase obligation. FERC has granted the request of California investor-owned utilities for a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation for Qualifying Facilities larger than 20 MW in size. In addition, FERC recently amended its PURPA regulations to reduce the rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities in organized markets have nondiscriminatory access to markets from 5 MW to 20 MW. Therefore, the California investor-owned utilities may have a basis to further reduce their mandatory purchase obligation.
 
We expect that our power plants in the U.S will continue to meet all of the criteria required for Qualifying Facility status under PURPA. However, since the Heber power plants have PPAs with Southern California Edison that require Qualifying Facility status to be maintained, maintaining Qualifying Facility status remains a key obligation. If any of the Heber power plants loses its Qualifying Facility status our operations could be adversely affected. Loss of Qualifying Facility status would eliminate the Heber power plants’ exemption from the FPA and thus, among other things, the rates charged by the Heber power plants in the PPAs with Southern California Edison and SCPPA would become subject to FERC regulation. Further, it is possible that the utilities that purchase power from the power plants could successfully obtain a waiver of the mandatory-purchase obligation in their service territories. For example, the three California investor-owned utilities have received such a waiver from FERC for projects larger than 20 MW. If a waiver of the mandatory purchase obligation is obtained, or if FERC reduces the 20 MW threshold or eliminates the mandatory purchase obligation, the power plants’ existing PPAs will not be affected, but the utilities will not be obligated under PURPA to renew or extend these PPAs or execute new PPAs upon the existing PPAs’ expiration.

Under PUHCA 2005, the books and records of a utility holding company, its affiliates, associate companies, and subsidiaries are subject to FERC and state commission review with respect to transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of either FERC or the state commission or costs incurred by a jurisdictional utility in the same holding company system. However, if a company is a utility holding company solely with respect to Qualifying Facilities, exempt wholesale generators, or foreign utility companies, it will not be subject to review of books and records by FERC under PUHCA 2005. Qualifying Facilities or exempt wholesale generators that make only wholesale sales of electricity are not subject to state commissions’ rate regulations and, therefore, in all likelihood would not be subject to any review of their books and records by state commissions pursuant to PUHCA 2005 as long as the Qualifying Facility is not part of a holding company system that includes a utility subject to regulation in that state.
FPA
 
Pursuant to the FPA, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for most wholesale sales of electricity and transmission in interstate commerce. These rates may be based on a cost of service approach or may be determined on a market basis through competitive bidding or negotiation. FERC can accept, reject or suspend rates. The rates can be suspended for up to five months, at which point the rates become effective subject to refund. FERC can order refunds for rates that are found to be “unjust and unreasonable” or “unduly discriminatory or preferential.”
 
Moreover, the loss of the Qualifying Facility status of any of our power plants selling energy to Southern California Edison could also permit Southern California Edison, pursuant to the terms of its PPA, to cease taking and paying for electricity from the relevant power plant and to seek refunds for past amounts paid and/or a reduction in future payments. 
 
Additionally, FERC possesses civil penalty authority, up to approximately $1.3 million per violation of the FPA per day. FERC can also require the disgorgement of unjust profits earned in connection with such violations of the FPA and revoke the right of the power plants to make sales at market-based rates.
 
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FPA was supplemented to empower FERC to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric system. Such authority required that FERC assume both oversight and enforcement roles. Pursuant to its new directive, FERC certified the North American Electric Reliability Corporation as the nation’s Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop and enforce mandatory reliability standards to address medium and long-term reliability concerns. Today, enforcement of the mandatory reliability standards, including the protection of critical energy infrastructure, is a substantial function of the ERO and of FERC, which may impose penalties of up to approximately $1.3 million a day for violating mandatory reliability standards. 
 
Thus, if any of the power plants were to lose Qualifying Facility status, the application of the FPA and other applicable state regulations to such power plants could require compliance with an increasingly complex regulatory regime that may be costly and greatly reduce our operational flexibility. Even if a power plant does not lose Qualifying Facility status, the owner of a Qualifying Facility/power plant in excess of 20 MW will become subject to rate regulation under the FPA for sales of energy or capacity pursuant to a contract executed after March 17, 2006 or not pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA. A decrease in existing rates or being ordered by FERC to pay refunds for rates found to be “unjust and unreasonable” or “unduly discriminatory or preferential” would likely result in a decrease in our future revenues.
 
 State Regulation 
 
Our power plants in California, Nevada, Oregon, and Idaho, by virtue of being Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity, are not subject to rate, financial and organizational regulations applicable to electric utilities in those states. The power plants each sell or will sell their electrical output under PPAs to electric utilities (Sierra Pacific Power Company, Nevada Power Company, Southern California Edison, SCPPA and Idaho Power Company). All of the utilities except SCPPA are regulated by their respective state public utilities commissions. Sierra Pacific Power Company and Nevada Power Company, which merged and are doing business as NV Energy, are regulated by the PUCN. Southern California Edison is regulated by the CPUC.
 
Under Hawaiian law, non-fossil generators are not subject to regulation as public utilities. Hawaiian law provides that a geothermal power producer is to negotiate the rate for its output with the public utility purchaser. If such rate cannot be determined by mutual accord, the PUCH will set a just and reasonable rate. If a non-fossil generator in Hawaii is a Qualifying Facility, federal law applies to such Qualifying Facility and the utility is required to purchase the energy and capacity at its avoided cost. The rates for our power plant in Hawaii are established under a long-term PPA with HELCO.

Environmental Permits 
 
U.S. environmental permitting regimes with respect to geothermal projects center upon several general areas of focus. The first involves land use approvals. These may take the form of Special Use Permits or Conditional Use Permits from local planning authorities or a series of development and utilization plan approvals and right of way approvals where the geothermal facility is entirely or partly on BLM or United States Forest Service lands. Certain federal approvals require a review of environmental impacts in conformance with the federal National Environmental Policy Act. In California, some local permit approvals require a similar review of environmental impacts under a state statute known as the California Environmental Quality Act. These federal and local land use approvals typically impose conditions and restrictions on the construction, scope and operation of geothermal projects.
 
The second category of permitting focuses on the installation and use of the geothermal wells themselves. Geothermal projects typically have three types of wells: (i) exploration wells designed to define and verify the geothermal resource, (ii) production wells to extract the hot geothermal liquids (also known as brine) for the power plant, and (iii) injection wells to inject the brine back into the subsurface resource. For example, on BLM lands in Nevada, California, Oregon, and Idaho, the well permits take the form of geothermal drilling permits for well installation. Approvals are also required to modify wells, including for use as production or injection wells. For all wells drilled in Nevada, a geothermal drilling permit must be obtained from the Nevada Division of Minerals. Those wells in Nevada to be used for injection will also require UIC permits from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection and Bureau of Water Pollution Control. All geothermal wells drilled in Oregon (except on tribal lands) require a geothermal well drilling permit from the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. All geothermal wells drilled in Idaho require a well construction permit from the IDWR and injection wells also require UIC permitting through IDWR. Geothermal wells on private lands in California require drilling permits from the California Department of Conservation’s DOGGR. The eventual designation of these installed wells as individual production or injection wells and the ultimate closure of any wells is also reviewed and approved by DOGGR pursuant to a DOGGR-approved Geothermal Injection Program.
 
A third category of permits involves the regulation of potential air emissions associated with the construction and operation of wells and power plants and surface water discharges associated with construction and operations activities. Generally, each well and plant requires a preconstruction air permit and storm water discharge permit before earthwork can commence. In addition, in some jurisdictions the wells that are to be used for production require, and those used for injection may require air emissions permits to operate. Internal combustion engines and other air pollutant emissions sources at the projects may also require air emissions permits. For our projects, these permits are typically issued at the state or county level. Permits are also required to manage storm water during project construction and to manage drilling mud from well construction, as well as to manage certain discharges to surface impoundment, if any.
 
A fourth category of permits, required in Nevada, California, Oregon, and Idaho, includes ministerial permits such as building permits, hazardous materials storage and management permits, and pressure vessel operating permits. We are also required to obtain water rights permits in Nevada if water cooling is being used at the power plant. In addition to permits, there are various regulatory plans and programs that are required, including risk management plans (federal and state programs) and hazardous materials management plans (in California).
 
In some cases, our projects may also require permits, issued by the applicable federal agencies or authorized state agencies, regarding threatened or endangered species, permits to impact wetlands or other waters and notices of construction of structures which may have an impact on airspace. Environmental laws and regulations may change in the future that may modify the time to receive such permits and associated costs of compliance.
 
Our BESS projects are subject to similar permitting and regulatory compliance requirements. All of our current BESS projects are located on privately owned land and may require ministerial permits from local agencies as described above or undergo a state environmental permitting process (e.g., under the California Environmental Quality Act) with the city or county as the lead permitting agency. Storage projects are also required to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and similar to geothermal projects, storage projects may require various regulatory plans and programs including emergency action plans and fire response plans.

As of the date of this report, all of the material environmental permits and approvals currently required for our operating power plants and BESS projects have been obtained. We sometimes experience regulatory delays in obtaining various environmental permits and approvals required for projects in development and construction. These delays may lead to increases in the time and cost to complete these projects. Our operations are designed and conducted to comply with applicable environmental permit and approval requirements. Non-compliance with any such requirements could result in fines and penalties and could also affect our ability to operate the affected project.
 
Environmental Laws and Regulations 
 
Our facilities and operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to development, construction and operation. In the U.S, these may include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws and regulations.
 
Our geothermal operations involve significant quantities of brine (substantially, all of which we reinject into the subsurface) and scale, both of which can contain materials (such as arsenic, antimony, lead, and naturally occurring radioactive materials) in concentrations that exceed regulatory limits used to define hazardous waste. We also use various substances, including isopentane and industrial lubricants that could become potential contaminants and are generally flammable. As a result, our projects are subject to domestic and foreign federal, state and local statutory and regulatory requirements regarding the generation, handling, transportation, use, storage, treatment, fugitive emissions, and disposal of hazardous substances. The cost of investigation and removal or remediation activities associated with a spill or release of such materials could be significant. Hazardous materials are also used in our equipment manufacturing operations in Israel.
 
Although we are not aware of any mismanagement of these materials, including any mismanagement prior to the acquisition of some of our power plants that has materially impaired any of the power plant sites, any disposal or release of these materials onto the power plant sites, other than by means of permitted injection wells, could lead to contamination of the environment and result in material cleanup requirements or other responsive obligations under applicable environmental laws.
 
Regulation Related to Energy storage activity
 
Our participation in energy storage space and in energy management and demand response require us to obtain and maintain certain additional authorizations and approvals.  These include (1) authorization from FERC to make wholesale sales of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates, and (2) membership status with eligibility to serve designated contractual functions in the ISO/RTOs of PJM, NYISO, and ERCOT. In the future, we may need to obtain and maintain similar membership and eligibility status with other ISO/RTOs in order to offer such services in their respective areas.
 
Regulation of the Electric Utility Industry in our Foreign Countries of Operation 
 
The following is a summary overview of certain aspects of the electric industry in the foreign countries in which we have an operating geothermal power plant. As such, it should not be considered a full statement of the laws in such countries or all of the issues pertaining thereto.
 
Guatemala
 
The General Electricity Law of 1996, Decree 93-96, created a wholesale electricity market in Guatemala and established a new regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The law created a new regulatory commission, the CNEE, and a new wholesale power market administrator, the AMM, for the operation and administration of the sector. The AMM is a private not-for-profit entity. The CNEE functions as an independent agency under the Ministry of Energy and Mines and is in charge of regulating, supervising, and controlling compliance with the electricity law, overseeing the market and setting rates for transmission services, and distribution to medium and small customers. All distribution companies must supply electricity to such customers pursuant to long-term contracts with electricity generators. Large customers can contract directly with the distribution companies, electricity generators or power marketers, or buy energy in the spot market. Guatemala has approved a Law of Incentives for the Development of Renewable Energy Power plants, Decree 52-2003, in order to promote the development of renewable energy power plants in Guatemala. This law provides certain benefits to companies utilizing renewable energy, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and VAT on imports and customs duties. On September 16, 2008, CNEE issued a resolution that approved the Technical Norms for the Connection, Operation, Control and Commercialization of the Renewable Distributed Generation and Self-producers Users with Exceeding Amounts of Energy. This Technical Norm was created to regulate all aspects of generation, connection, operation, control and commercialization of electric energy produced with renewable sources to promote and facilitate the installation of new generation plants, and to promote the connection of existing generation plants which have excess amounts of electric energy for commercialization. It is applicable to projects with a capacity of up to 5 MW. At present, the General Electricity Law and the Law of Incentives for the Development or Renewable Energy Power Plants are still in force.

Kenya

The electric power sector in Kenya is regulated by the Kenyan Energy Act.  Among other things, the Kenyan Energy Act provides for the licensing of electricity power producers and public electricity suppliers or distributors. KPLC is the major licensed public electricity supplier and has a virtual monopoly in the distribution of electricity in the country with the exception of a few off-grid, which have recently been licensed by the EPRA. The Kenyan Energy Act permits IPPs to install power generators and sell electricity to KPLC, which is owned by various private and government entities, and which currently purchases energy and capacity from other IPPs in addition to our Olkaria III complex. The electricity sector is regulated by the EPRA under the Kenyan Energy Act. KPLC’s retail electricity rates are subject to approval by the EPRA. The EPRA has an expanded mandate to regulate not just the electric power sector but the entire energy sector in Kenya. Transmission of electricity is now undertaken by KETRACO while another company, GDC, is responsible for geothermal assessment, drilling of wells and sale of steam for electricity operations to IPPs and KenGen.  Both KETRACO and GDC are wholly owned by the government of Kenya. Renewable energy dominated by geothermal, wind and, presently at a lower level, solar is  one of the key energy sub-sectors in Kenya contributing significantly to the overall energy mix as a result of the implementation of the feed-in- tariff policy by the Ministry of Energy. Under the national constitution enacted in August 2010, formulation of energy policy (including electricity) and energy regulation are functions of the national government. However, the constitution lists the planning and development of electricity and energy regulation as a function of the county governments (i.e. the regional or local level where an individual power plant is or is intended to be located).
Indonesia
 
The 2009 Electricity Law (as amended by the Indonesian Omnibus Law in 2020) divides  the power business into two broad categories: (i) activities that supply electrical power, both public supply and captive supply (own use), such as electrical power generation, electrical power transmission, electrical power distribution and the sale of electrical power and (ii) the activities involved in electrical power support such as services businesses (consulting, construction, installation, operation & maintenance, certification & training, testing etc.) and industry businesses (power tools & power equipment supply electricity power supporting businesses). Currently, power generation is dominated by PLN (state owned company), which controls around 70% of generating assets in Indonesia. Private sector participation is allowed through an IPP scheme. IPP appointment mostly is done through tenders although IPPs can also be directly appointed or selected. The 2009 Electricity Law, as amended, provides PLN priority rights to conduct the electricity power business nationwide. As the sole owner of transmission and distribution assets, PLN remains the only business entity involved in transmitting and distributing, although the 2009 Electricity Law, as amended,  allows private participation. The Geothermal Law issued in 2014 (as also amended by the Indonesian Omnibus Law in 2020), endorses private participation as geothermal IPP. The geothermal IPP appointment is done through tender held by the Central Government. The central government will also award the tender winner a Geothermal License (IPB). Accordingly, the Geothermal License holder can conduct exploration and feasibility studies within five years and subject to two one-year extensions, conduct well development and power plant construction and sell the electricity generated to PLN for a maximum of 30 years. Prior to the expiration of the Geothermal License, the IPP can propose to extend the license for an additional 20 years. Starting in 2017, the regulatory framework with respect to tariffs is based on PLN's existing average cost of generation (known by its Indonesian acronym, BPP) with respect to the relevant local grid cost of generation, excluding  transmission and distribution costs. The Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources ("MEMR") releases each year a list of local BPPs for each region and a national BPP (which is an average of the local BPPs). The BPPs for a particular year are based on PLN's previous year audited generation costs. In 2019, the MEMR published BPP figures of year 2018. The national BPP was set at Rp 983/kWh (equivalent to US$ cent 7.39/kWh at Rp 13,307/US$) based on 86 US$ per kWh. The MEMR did not publish PLN's 2016 audited generation costs.
 
For 2020, the regulation was not clear and has been revoked, but the general interpretation is that for geothermal projects in Sumatera, Java and Bali islands, the tariff will be determined based on mutual agreement between PLN and the IPP, regardless of the BPP figures in those regions. The central government is currently assessing preparing a draft presidential regulation that is expected to amend the tariff mechanism for renewable IPPs, including geothermal. The latest plan to adopt a Feed in Tariff scheme for Geothermal and Renewable Energy IPP is to revert to the previous geographically based ceiling tariff regime, with an added dimension of the timing of achieving commercial operation date.

Guadeloupe 
 
EDF is the transmission and distribution utility in Guadeloupe and also operates a significant portion of Guadeloupe’s fossil fuel energy generation. There are also a number of IPPs in Guadeloupe, primarily producing renewable electricity. The electricity sector in Guadeloupe is regulated by the Commission Regulation of Energy (CRE), which also regulates EDF’s operations in mainland France and its other overseas territories. The electricity sector in Guadeloupe is characterized by both enabling features and obstacles with respect to renewable energy. One of the most influential enabling features is a French law requiring the utility to purchase power from any interconnected renewable generator. The major obstacle preventing further uptake of renewable electricity generation is the cap on variable generation at 30% of instantaneous system load. According to the multi-annual energy program (PPE) for Guadeloupe, the island aims to reach total energy independence by 2030. The program outlines the development schedule with an emphasis on solar, wind and geothermal growth for the years 2023-2026. The PPE also predict a geothermal installed capacity of 78MW for the year 2028.
Honduras
 
In 2014, Honduras approved its new Law of Electrical Industry (Decree 404-2013, and its Regulation, published in the Official Newspaper on November 18, 2015; and by Executive Accord 07-2015), which provides the legal framework for the electricity sector and replaces the previous Electricity Subsector Framework Law (Decree 158 of 1994, regulated by Accord 934 of 1997).   The Law establishes technology-specific auctions for renewable energy. It creates the Regulatory Commission of Electric Power (CREE) as the entity in charge of supervising the bidding processes and the awarding of PPAs. The CREE is also responsible for granting study permits for the construction of generation projects that use renewable natural resources. Permits will have a maximum duration of two years, and will be revoked if no studies have been initiated within a period of six months and the reports required by the CREE have not been submitted. The new Law also establishes that all new capacity must be contracted through auctions and that the government can set a minimum quota for renewables in each auction. With respect to metering, after previous regulation applied legal incentives to renewable energy metering, the new law mandates utilities to buy excess power and credit it towards monthly bills and to install bi-directional meters. 
 
Among others, the objectives of the law are to adapt the electricity sector’s legislation to the Framework Treaty for the Central American Electricity Market, which Honduras is a party to, and update the operating rules in the country’s electricity industry by incorporating structures and modern practices to increase the sector’s efficiency and competency in the production and marketing of electricity services.
 
With the passage of this new law, Honduras is moving into a new and open market. Under this legislation, all aspects of the market have been opened to private parties. This legislation is still being implemented within the market.
 
Honduras has also approved a Law of Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects, Decree 70-2007, further amended by Decree 138-2013, with additional incentives to solar PV projects, etc.  The purpose, as in other countries of the region, is to promote the development of renewable energy power plants. Laws provide certain benefits to companies that generate power through renewable sources, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and VAT on imports and customs duties, a fast track process for certain permits and a Sovereign Guaranty by the Central Government for the payments of the off-taker, the Public Utility Company, ENEE.  At present, the Law of the Electrical Industry and the Laws of Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects are still in force.
