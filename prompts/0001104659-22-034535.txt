OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the fast growing and highly attractive U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets with a premium Spanish-language streaming platform distributed in the U.S., five Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in the U.S., two Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in Latin America, the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico, a 40% interest in the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia and a leading distributor of content to television and digital media platforms in Latin America.
We target the fast growing and highly attractive U.S. Hispanic and Latin America markets. The number of U.S. Hispanic television households grew over five times more than the overall U.S. households between the period from the start of 2010 through the end of 2021. Additionally, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that between 2020 and 2030 there will be a 21% increase in the U.S. Hispanic population, reaching approximately 75 million Hispanics in 2030. Pew Hispanic Trends estimates that 96% of Latinos believe that it's important for future generations of U.S. Hispanics to speak Spanish.
On March 31, 2021, we acquired the remaining 75% equity interest in Pantaya that we did not already own. Pantaya is the number one Spanish-language streaming platform in the United States by subscribers, with close to one million subscribers as of December 31, 2021. Pantaya targets a large, untapped addressable over-the-top ("OTT") market for U.S. Hispanic viewers, offering content directly to viewers on smart phones, connected TVs and other internet-enabled devices. According to Collage Group, there are 34 million Spanish dominant and bicultural adults over the age of 18 in the U.S. accessing at least one streaming service. Out of that group, 25 million want more reflective characters and seek out shows and movies about Hispanic characters and stories. According to the Pantaya Brands Study 2021 by the Collage Group, only 32% of Spanish dominant and bicultural adults over the age of 18 are aware of Pantaya. This provides a substantial addressable market for us to target. Pantaya currently has the number one grossing Spanish-language entertainment app for both Android and iOS, both ranking in the top 20 for entertainment apps in the United States. Notably, Pantaya has been the most downloaded Android entertainment app in Puerto Rico since June 1, 2021.
Headquartered in Miami, Florida, our portfolio consists of the following:

On March 31, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 75% equity interest from Lionsgate, and Pantaya is now a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company.

Our Strategy
Our strategy in the U.S. is to provide unique programming focused on the large and rapidly growing U.S. Hispanic population, including super serving those segments often overlooked by our competitors. Our platforms allow many viewers in the U.S. to feel connected with their home countries, including high quality, differentiated local news, sports and premium entertainment content. For instance, WAPA America is the only nightly newscast from Puerto Rico created for U.S. Hispanics, which is a part of the network's over 71 hours of weekly original news and entertainment programming. Additionally, Pasiones remains the highest rated telenovela cable network in primetime to offer unique and popular telenovelas from around the globe. Pantaya furthers our deep and broad reach among the U.S. Hispanic population, as the leading premium subscription Spanish-language streaming platform to cater to this highly attractive demographic. By focusing on these specific Hispanic markets, we provide targeted, attractive and relevant content, while avoiding direct competition with channels such as Univision and Telemundo, which more acutely target the U.S. Mexican demographic. We believe that our portfolio of brands offers the only platform that speaks to all segments of the U.S. Hispanic population.

WAPA has been the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico since the start of Nielsen audience measurement twelve years ago and management believes it is highly valued by its viewers and cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers. WAPA is distributed by all pay-TV distributors in Puerto Rico and has been successfully growing subscriber revenue. WAPA's primetime household rating for the year ended December 31, 2021 was nearly four times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW. As a result of its ratings success since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, management believes WAPA is well positioned for future growth in subscriber revenue.
WAPA America, Cinelatino, Pasiones, Centroamerica TV and Television Dominicana occupy a valuable and unique position, as they are among the small group of Hispanic cable networks to have achieved broad distribution in the U.S. We expect WAPA America, Cinelatino and Pasiones to launch on YouTube TV in the first half of 2022, further accelerating the breadth of their distribution. As a result, management believes our U.S. cable networks are well-positioned to benefit from growth in both the growing national advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic cable television audience, and growth in the U.S. Hispanic population, which is expected to continue its long-term upward trajectory. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, nearly 62.1 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2020, representing an increase of more than 27 million people between 2000 and 2020, and that number is projected to grow to approximately 75 million by 2030. U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 35% during the period from 2010 to 2021, from 12.9 million households to 17.5 million households. Although our U.S. cable networks total subscribers declined during 2021, given the projected growth of the U.S. Hispanic population, we are optimistic that our U.S. cable networks total subscribers will see renewed long-term growth.
Our strategy in Latin America is to make similar strides as our networks in the U.S. Additionally, Canal 1 represents one of only three national broadcast television networks in Colombia, the second largest Latin American advertising market (excluding Brazil). We believe that Canal 1 can create a compelling, differentiated programming option in Colombia, similar to our experience with WAPA in Puerto Rico. In Latin America, Cinelatino and Pasiones are included in basic cable packages. We believe we are underpenetrated in the market, which provides room for growth and increased market share. We believe that our business model is highly scalable and that we could drive profitable growth by replicating this model across Latin America.
We believe that our platform value is significant, allowing us to leverage content and distribution relationships across different geographies. We are able to use compelling content that we own or have licensed across our media properties, giving us economies of scale.
Our objective is to maintain and improve our position as a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets by, among other things:
Growing subscriber revenue — We believe Pantaya and our Networks are well-positioned to further grow our subscriber revenue, fueled by continued growth in the U.S. Hispanic population and our robust content portfolio. For example, WAPA entered into renewals with two of the largest Distributors in Puerto Rico on very favorable terms by virtue of its dominance in the Puerto Rico market, and these agreements will generate significant subscriber revenue growth for us. With no reverse compensation, our subscriber revenue has high margin flow through to income. We expect to continue to expand the distribution of our Networks in the U.S. through virtual MVPDs, such as YouTube TV, in the coming year. For example, all five of our cable networks in the U.S. launched on fuboTV in 2022. Pantaya launched on YouTube TV in the quarter ended September 30, 2021, expanding its customer base and driving subscriber revenue. As multi-channel video distributors, such as cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers, which we refer to as MVPDs, and app platform distributors become more focused on targeting the Hispanic audience as a way to grow subscribers, we believe that our Networks and streaming platform will be well-positioned to capture the upside. We plan to leverage the promotional strength of our Networks to meaningfully accelerate Pantaya's subscriber growth.

Investing in content for Pantaya and our Networks to drive subscriber growth and build viewership - We have made substantial investment in our programming and marketing efforts in order to expand our subscriber base and build viewership, as well as increase our attractiveness to advertisers. We will continue to invest in programming through original production, licensing and acquisition. In 2022, Pantaya is set to release 16 original series and many motion picture premiers, increasing both the quality and volume of its programming. At WAPA, we have successfully created a highly differentiated content strategy and in doing so, have maintained a #1 ratings ranking in the Puerto Rico market for twelve consecutive years. Cinelatino, as the only buyer of scale that can cover both the U.S. and Latin American markets for television rights to Spanish-language films, is well-positioned to acquire the best content available at favorable terms and has built an expansive content library.
Driving growth in advertising sales - We continue to see an opportunity to increase our advertising revenues. Our U.S. cable networks are well positioned to benefit from the advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic audience. From 2000 to 2020, Hispanics accounted for 54% of all U.S. population growth, outpacing all other non-Hispanic groups. U.S. Hispanics are an attractive group for advertisers with massive and rapidly growing buying power expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2025, according to The Multicultural Economy, 2021 by the Selig Center for Economic Growth. From 2010 to 2020, Hispanic buying power increased by 87%, outpacing non-Hispanics, whose buying power increased by 51% during the same time, according to The Multicultural Economy, 2021 by the Selig Center for Economic Growth. We offer a unique and differentiated target audience for our advertisers, driven by our targeted demographic and our ability to segment the U.S. Hispanic population.
Develop and expand content licensing revenue - Presently, our two primary revenue streams are subscriber revenue and advertising revenue, but we believe an opportunity exists to grow our revenues from content licensing. We own or control all media rights for a vast majority of our content and we continue to produce original content. In November 2018, we acquired Snap Media, which provides us with the expertise and relationships to expand our content licensing business. Our strategy is to window content across our platforms and to license the content to third parties for exploitation on free-TV, pay-TV, OTT, SVOD and AVOD platforms in the U.S. and Latin America. We believe this high-margin revenue from content licensing will help drive our revenue growth and profitability.
Acquisition-driven growth - We continue to look for attractive opportunities that are complementary and accretive to our existing business. We intend to take a long-term view and primarily seek opportunities which will expand our leadership position in the fast growing and highly desirable Spanish-language media market in the U.S. and Latin America. We intend to seek acquisition opportunities where we believe a catalyst for value realization is already present or where we can realize synergies with our existing businesses. These may include Spanish-language cable networks distributed in the U.S., Latin American broadcast and cable television networks, radio stations, production companies and content libraries.
Employees
At December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries employed 363 full-time persons. In the normal course of business, we use contract personnel to supplement our employee base to meet business needs. We or our subsidiaries may hire additional personnel in connection with the closing of future acquisitions. We believe that employee relations are generally satisfactory. At December 31, 2021, approximately 141 of our employees based in Puerto Rico are full-time unionized employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (the "CBA"). The CBA expires on May 31, 2022 and covers all of our unionized employees.
Revenue Sources
Our two primary sources of revenues are advertising revenue and subscriber revenue. All of our Networks derive revenues from advertising. Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time, which is typically sold pursuant to advertising orders with advertisers providing for an agreed upon advertising commitment and price per spot. Our advertising revenue is tied to the success of our programming, including the popularity of our programming with our target audience. Our advertising is variable in nature and tends to reflect seasonal patterns of our advertisers’ demand, which is generally greatest during the fourth quarter of each year, driven by the holiday buying season. In addition, Puerto Rico’s political election cycle occurs every four years and we benefit from increased advertising sales in an election year. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced higher advertising sales as a result of political advertising spending during the 2020 gubernatorial elections in Puerto Rico. The next election in Puerto Rico will be in 2024.

All of our Networks receive fees paid by MVPDs. These revenues are generally based on a per subscriber fee pursuant to multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as “affiliation agreements,” which typically provide for annual rate increases. The specific subscriber revenue we earn varies from period to period, Distributor to Distributor and also varies among our Networks, but is generally based upon the number of each Distributor’s paying subscribers who receive our Networks. The terms of certain non-U.S. affiliation agreements provide for payment of a fixed contractual monthly fee. Changes in subscriber revenue at our Networks are primarily derived from changes in contractual affiliation rates charged for our Networks and changes in the number of subscribers. MVPDs report their subscriber numbers to our Networks generally on a two month lag. We record revenue based on estimates of the number of subscribers utilizing the most recently received remittance reporting of each MVPD, which is consistent with our past practice and industry practice. Revenue is recognized on a month by month basis when the performance obligations to provide service to the MVPDs is satisfied. Payment is typically due and received within sixty days of the remittance. Our Networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of Distributors. We set forth our net revenues, total assets and operating income in “Item 8. Financial Statements.”
We also generate subscriber revenue from subscriptions to Pantaya, our streaming platform. Pantaya is available directly to consumers through our web application as well as through distribution partners. Certain distribution partners charge a fee, which is recorded in cost of revenues. Subscribers are billed at the start of their monthly or annual membership and revenue is recognized ratably over each applicable membership period. Subscriber revenue varies from period to period and is generally based upon the number of paying subscribers to our streaming platform. Estimates of revenue generated but not yet reported by the Company’s third party Distributors are made based on the estimated number of subscribers using the most recently received remittance reporting from each Distributor, which is consistent with our past practice and industry practice.
We continually review the quality of our programming to ensure that it is maximizing our platforms’ viewership and giving our platforms’ subscribers a premium, high-value experience. Growth in our subscriber revenue will, to a certain extent, be dependent on the growth in direct subscribers to our streaming platform, growth in subscribers of the cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers distributing our Networks as well as the app platforms distributing our streaming platform, new system launches including launches on virtual MVPDs (e.g. YouTube TV, Hulu, etc.) and continued carriage of our Networks and streaming platform by our distribution partners. Our revenues also benefit from contractual rate increases stipulated in most of our affiliation agreements.
In 2021, we generated approximately 95% of our net revenues from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated net revenues of $185.3 million and $141.9 million, respectively, from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated net revenues of $10.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively, from outside the United States.

Pantaya has numerous competitors who offer subscription streaming services, including Netflix, Discovery, Viacom, Disney, Amazon and AT&T. Additionally, TelevisaUnivision has announced that they are launching their own subscription streaming service in 2022. These competitors may secure better terms from content suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. We also compete with providers of AVOD services as well as free advertising supported television (“FAST”), which offer consumers free content in exchange for viewing advertisements.
Our Networks compete with other Spanish-language broadcast and cable television networks, streaming platforms and other digital media companies for the acquisition of programming, viewership, the sale of advertising and creative talent. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content impacts our viewership and the sale of advertising.

13



We also compete with both Spanish-language and English-language broadcast and cable television networks for distribution of our Networks and the fees paid by cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers. Our ability to retain and secure distribution agreements is necessary to maintain and grow subscriber revenue, and to attain viewership which drives advertising sales. Our contractual agreements with Distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The launch of new networks and consolidation within the cable and satellite distribution industry may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain distribution of our Networks.
Additionally, new entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.
Certain technological advances, including the increased deployment of fiber optic cable, are expected to allow cable and telecommunication video service providers to continue to expand both their channel and broadband distribution capacities and to increase transmission speeds. In addition, the ability to deliver content via new methods and devices is expected to increase substantially. The impact of such added capacities is hard to predict, but the development of new channels of content distribution could lead to increased competition for viewers by facilitating the emergence of additional channels and mobile and internet platforms through which viewers could view programming that is similar to that offered by our Networks.
WAPA competes with broadcast television networks and cable television networks in Puerto Rico for audience viewership, advertising sales, and programming. WAPA's main competitor is the Puerto Rican Telemundo affiliate, which relies heavily on programming from the U.S., consisting primarily of telenovelas produced in Mexico, the U.S. and Latin America. There are a few other local broadcasters, but they tend not to be competitive due to weak programming and/or poor signal quality. In addition, while all major English-language U.S. broadcast networks have local affiliates, they are, for the most part, low power stations with nominal ratings. Cable channels are generally not competitive, as they tend to be U.S.-based, English- language channels with little relevance to the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican audience, and pay television is much less widely penetrated in Puerto Rico than the U.S. WAPA has effectively customized its programming for the viewing preferences of the Puerto Rican market with more local entertainment and news programming than its competitors, as well as blockbuster Hollywood movies and hit U.S. television series (dubbed into Spanish). As a result, since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, WAPA has been the ratings leader for the past twelve years. WAPA Deportes competes for viewership, advertising sales and programming with other channels offering similar sports programming in Puerto Rico. Competitors include U.S.-based cable networks, such as ESPN, TNT, and TBS. WAPA.TV, WAPA's mobile-optimized website, directly competes with other local news, weather and entertainment sites for traffic and advertising sales. To some extent, WAPA.TV also competes with search engines and social networks, such as Google and Facebook, for digital advertising revenue.
Many of the competitors noted in this section have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources, and our financial resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming, websites and other content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The protection of our Networks' and Pantaya's brands and content is of primary importance to our success. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and internet/domain name statutes, laws and contractual provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work.

14



Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.
INDUSTRY
U.S. Hispanic Market
Hispanics represent the largest minority group in the U.S. at 19% of the total U.S. population and a rapidly expanding demographic, accounting for 54% of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2020. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, nearly 62.1 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2020, representing an increase of more than 27 million people between 2000 and 2020. This trend is expected to continue as the U.S. Hispanic population is projected to grow to approximately 75 million by 2030, an increase of 21% from 2020. As a result of this growth, the U.S. Hispanic market represents massive addressable market equivalent to the eighth largest economy in the world and with buying power expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2025. In addition, the Hispanic population on average is significantly younger than the overall population. For example, the median age of U.S. Hispanics is 30, which is nine years younger than the median age for the total US.
Not only is the Hispanic population in the U.S. significantly younger than the overall population, but the Hispanic population is more connected and more inclined to consume information online. Connected device penetration is significantly higher, with ownership of smartphones, computers and smart TVs over- indexed to the total U.S. population by 104%, 113% and 125%, respectively. Six out of ten hours of Hispanic TV content viewing are streamed, and, amongst Hispanics, streaming has overtaken both broadcast and cable to become the #1 source for video entertainment. Moreover, Hispanics average 4.9 subscription services compared to 3.9 for non-Hispanic whites according to Collage Group.
Claritas estimates that as of January 1, 2022, over 67% of the U.S. Hispanic population was of Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Rican, the second largest Hispanic national group, at 10%. There are more than 6.3 million Puerto Ricans and an additional 6.0 million Hispanics from other Caribbean countries residing in the mainland U.S., and together, Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics represent over 19% of the total U.S. Hispanic population. The Puerto Rican population in the U.S. (outside of Puerto Rico) grew 86% from 2000 to 2022, while the overall Caribbean Hispanic population grew 106% during the same time period, including the Dominican population which grew 240% from 2000 to 2022.

Central Americans are the third largest U.S. Hispanic regional population group in the U.S. (behind Mexicans and Caribbean Hispanics), and represent the fastest growing segment of the U.S. Hispanic population. There are over 6.3 million Central Americans residing in the U.S., an increase of approximately 299% since 2000. Central Americans comprise approximately 10% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2022, compared to approximately 4% in 2000.

Hispanic Television and Pay-TV Landscape
Within the U.S. cable network industry, the U.S. Hispanic demographic is attractive for a number of reasons:

● | Growth in Hispanic TV households: U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 35% during the period from 2010 to 2021, from 12.9 million households to 17.5 million households, over five times the overall U.S. television household growth of only 6.5%. The continued long-term growth of Hispanic television households creates a significant opportunity to reach an attractive audience at a time when overall household growth in the U.S. is more modest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hispanic pay-TV subscribers: Although Hispanic pay-TV subscribers declined during 2021, given the expected growth of Hispanic television households, we are optimistic that Hispanic pay-TV subscribers will see renewed long-term growth, particularly as our Networks launch on virtual MVPDs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Television Viewing and Language Preferences

● | Hispanics Enjoy Movies: In 2020, the last year in which data is available, Hispanics made up only 19% of the U.S. population, yet they comprised 29% of the country's movie ticket purchasers. In fact, the President of the National Association of Theater Owners described Hispanics as "the most valuable component of moviegoers." In 2020, even though overall attendance was down significantly due to COVID-19, Hispanics with an average of one visit for the year saw more movies than any other ethnic community.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hispanics Prefer Television in Spanish: Spanish remains the most used language in the home by U.S. Hispanic adults, and this powerfully influences television viewing habits. According to Nielsen, about 66% of Hispanics aged 18 and over speak Spanish as much as or more than English in their homes. Spanish-dominant or bilingual (Spanish/English Equal) homes comprise 63% of U.S. Hispanic households, and these homes exhibit a strong preference to watch television in their native language. In 2021, Spanish-dominant adults in key marketing demographics viewed about 23% of television in Spanish and bilingual adults viewed 68% of television in Spanish.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hispanic Advertising Market
Persons living in Hispanic television households represent 18% of the total U.S. television household population and 11% of the total U.S. buying power, but the aggregate linear television media spend targeted at U.S. Hispanics significantly under-indexes both of these metrics. As a result, advertisers have been allocating a higher proportion of marketing dollars to the Hispanic linear television market. Hispanic household income is growing much faster than the general population making this an increasingly attractive demographic for advertisers. From 2010 to 2020, Hispanic buying power increased by 87%, outpacing non-Hispanics, whose buying power increased by 51% during the same time, according to The Multicultural Economy, 2021 by the Selig Center for Economic Growth.
Viewing of Spanish-language cable networks as a percentage of total Spanish-language television viewing has grown by 18% from 2008 to 2021.

16



Latin American Market (excluding Brazil)
Pay-TV subscribers in Latin America grew by 14% from 2014 to 2021, and are projected to grow an additional 7 million from 53 million in 2021 to 60 million by 2025. Pay-TV penetration of television households has remained relatively stable at 46% from 2014 to 2021 and is projected to modestly increase to 48% by 2025. Cinelatino and Pasiones are currently distributed to only approximately 26% and 29% of pay TV subscribers (excluding Brazil), respectively, presenting an attractive growth opportunity.
Colombia, where we own 40% of Canal 1, the #3-rated broadcast television network, is a large and appealing market for broadcast television. Colombia had an estimated population of 51.6 million as of January 1, 2022, the second largest in Latin America (excluding Brazil). According to IBOPE, the three major broadcast networks in Colombia receive a 55% share of overall viewing. These factors result in an annual market for free-to-air television advertising of $256 million (as converted utilizing the average foreign exchange rate during the period).
Puerto Rico Overview
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and has a U.S. dollar-based economy, U.S. rule of law and strong governmental ties to the United States. The broadcast television industry in Puerto Rico is regulated by the FCC, and the banking system is regulated under the U.S. system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). Puerto Rico has a population of approximately 3.3 million, with an additional 6.3 million Puerto Ricans living in the mainland U.S. All Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.
Economy
The Puerto Rican economy has been in a recession since 2006, and its gross national product (GNP) has contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2018 (except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012). The Puerto Rico Planning Board estimates real GNP increased approximately 1.5% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and María, and that it decreased approximately 5.4% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. 
Puerto Rico has been burdened by limited economic activity, lower than estimated revenue collections, high government debt levels relative to the size of the economy and other fiscal challenges. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed HR 5278 Bill, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which, among other things, established a seven member planning board with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Commonwealth’s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, has resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on their public debt and entering into bankruptcy proceedings under PROMESA.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 15, 2020, the Puerto Rico Governor issued an executive order declaring a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place, implementing a mandatory curfew, and requiring the closure of all businesses, except for businesses that provide essential services, including banking and financial institutions with respect to certain services. Many of the restrictions have been gradually lifted and most economic metrics are trending positively.
Puerto Rico also made tremendous progress on the vaccination front. In fact, Puerto Rico has a lower rate of COVID-19 cases than any U.S. state except Nebraska and a higher rate of vaccination against COVID-19 than any state except Vermont (according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data as of March 1, 2022), which has facilitated a return to normalized commercial activity. Most key economic metrics are trending very positively. The tourism and hospitality sector in Puerto Rico has seen tremendous growth. Occupancy rates in 2021 nearly doubled as compared to 2020 and exceeded 2019 by 4%, according to Tourism Analytics. Airport passenger traffic in 2021 was approximately 9.7 million nearly double as compared to 2020 and exceeded 2019 by approximately 3%. Auto sales in 2021 increased 36% as compared to 2020 and exceeded 2019 by 21%, according to the United Automobile Importers Group (based on units). Cement sales in 2021 increased 13% as compared to 2020, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
The macroeconomic outlook for Puerto Rico has improved from the loosening of Covid-19-related restrictions on economic activity, combined with federal disaster recovery funds Puerto Rico is expected to receive related to the recovery from hurricane Maria 

17



in 2017. In addition, seven years since the Commonwealth announced that it was unable to pay its outstanding debt obligations, on January 18, 2022, the Title III bankruptcy court approved a plan of adjustment that would restructure $33 billion of public debt to $7.4 billion in new bonds. Nevertheless, any recovery of the Puerto Rican economy could be adversely impacted by macroeconomic developments within the United States and across the globe. 
Puerto Rico Broadcast Television Market
Puerto Rico has 1.3 million television households, comparable to that of a top 25 U.S. television market. Puerto Rico is the third largest U.S. Hispanic market behind Los Angeles and New York.
Puerto Rican television broadcasters capture the dominant share of viewership, which is unique relative to the U.S. The three primary broadcasters in Puerto Rico-WAPA, Univision and Telemundo-collectively garner approximately 76% of all television household viewership in primetime, distinguishing Puerto Rico from the U.S. television market, where the four major national broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox) garner a collective primetime audience share of 27%. In fact, WAPA's primetime household rating in 2021 was nearly four times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our broadcast and cable network operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Puerto Rico and other countries where they operate. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our Business are constantly subject to change. This section contains a summary of certain government regulations that may affect our operations. This information is summary in nature and does not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our Business.
Introduction
Our Networks are subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). Under authority of the Communications Act, the FCC, among other things, assigns frequency bands for broadcast stations, including the WAPA stations, and other uses; determines the location, frequency and operating power of stations; grants permits and licenses to construct and operate television stations on particular frequencies; issues, revokes, modifies and renews television broadcast station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operations and profitability of broadcasting stations.
The FCC has also adopted various rules that regulate the content of programming broadcast by television stations, including the WAPA station, and carried by cable networks, including our Cable Networks. These rules regulate, among other things, children’s programming, sponsorship identification disclosures, closed captioning of certain television programming, improper uses of the emergency alert system attention tone, and obscene, indecent and profane content. Additionally, the FCC’s rules require broadcast stations to implement equal employment opportunity outreach programs and maintain records relating to these programs and make filings with the FCC evidencing such efforts. The FCC could also adopt other regulations that affect cable networks, such as the requirement that the cable programming services be on an “á la carte” basis, which could affect their business operations.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, and specific FCC rules and policies and certain other statutes and regulations. The summaries are not intended to describe all present and proposed statutes and FCC rules and regulations that impact broadcast television and cable network operations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short-term” (less than the maximum term) broadcast license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a broadcast license renewal application, the revocation of a broadcast license, or the withholding of approval for acquisition of additional broadcast properties.

18



FCC Licenses and Renewal
The Communications Act permits the operation of a broadcast station only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast licenses for specified periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms (ordinarily for the full term of eight years). Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may renew a broadcast station's license, either with conditions or without, or it may designate the renewal application for hearing. The licensees of all television stations serving communities in Puerto Rico were required to file renewal applications by October 1, 2020. We filed renewal applications for our television stations on October 1, 2020. These applications have been granted for full eight-year terms expiring on February 1, 2029.
Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings
The FCC's broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast properties that we are allowed to hold or acquire. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. The rules limit the common ownership, directly or by way of attribution, operation or control of television stations serving the same area. The rules also limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations under common ownership, directly or by way of attribution. In 2017, the FCC relaxed certain ownership rules. In September 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's 2017 decision. As a result of the Third Circuit's decision, certain changes to the local television ownership rule, which had permitted the common ownership of two television stations in all markets as long as the commonly owned stations were not both among the top-four stations, based on audience share, were eliminated, and the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership and radio-television cross ownership rules were reinstated. In October 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider an appeal of the Third Circuit decision. In April 2021, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision reinstating the FCC's 2017 decision, which resulted in the elimination of the newspaper-broadcast and radio-television cross ownership rules and relaxation of the local television ownership rule to permit ownership of two television stations in all markets as long as both are not among the top-four rated stations in a market. In June 2021, the FCC issued an Order formally implementing the changes reflected in its 2017 decision. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its statutorily mandated quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules. Because of the changes implemented as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, the FCC's Media Bureau asked parties, in June 2021, to update their record in the 2018 quadrennial review. The review is still pending. The FCC's rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits. In general, officers, directors and stockholders holding 5% or more of the voting interests in Hemisphere are deemed to have attributable interests. The FCC's ownership limits therefore apply to our principals and certain investors in our Company. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC's current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC.
In December 2017, the FCC opened a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the national television audience reach cap and the 50% discount that is given to UHF stations in determining compliance with the national audience cap. That proposed rulemaking remains pending as of the date of this Annual Report.

19



Local Television Ownership Rule
Under the local television ownership rule, one party may own, operate, or control up to two television stations in a market, so long as at least one of the stations is not one of the top four rated stations (based on audience share) in the television market. Requests for a waiver of the prohibition on owning two top-four stations will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The rule also permits the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations' Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. Broadcast stations designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations are exempt from the local television ownership rule. WNJX TV and WTIN TV have been designated by the FCC as "satellite" stations of WAPA TV, a division of WAPA. An entity that has an attributable ownership interest in Hemisphere also has an attributable interest in television stations owned by Univision, including Station WSTE, licensed to Ponce, Puerto Rico. Because of this attributable interest, under the current local television ownership rule, without a waiver, we would not be permitted to acquire an attributable interest in any other full power television stations serving Puerto Rico. The FCC may waive its local television ownership rule to permit ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market that would not otherwise be permissible if one of the stations is in involuntary bankruptcy, is a "failed" station, or is "failing" (i.e., stations with negative cash flow and less than a four share all day audience rating). Under the local television ownership rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in market station's weekly programming or advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station.
Attribution of Ownership
Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of broadcast ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station’s total weekly programming or is a same-market broadcast company ; (vi) time brokerage of a broadcast station by a same-market broadcast company; and (vii) same-market radio joint sales agreements. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC’s current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. Pending before the FCC is a proposal to eliminate the single majority shareholder exception. The FCC is also considering a proposal to require the disclosure in biennial ownership reports of information about five percent or greater voting shareholders, even if such interests are not attributable under the FCC’s ownership rules.
Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC’s current ownership rules. However, the FCC now requires that television stations make any shared services agreements available in a station’s public inspection file.
Commission Approval of Transfer of Control of FCC Licenses
The FCC’s prior approval is required for the transfer of control or assignment of FCC licenses. We are currently controlled by Gato Investments LP (“Gato”), which owns a majority of our Class B common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B common stock”). The FCC’s prior consent would be required prior to any transaction that would result in a change in control of Hemisphere or Gato. An application for consent to a transfer of control or assignment of licenses would be subject to a formal public notice and comment period during which petitions to deny the applications would be accepted by the FCC.
A person or entity requesting the FCC’s consent to acquire or obtain control of our television station licenses must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest. As discussed above, we own two television stations, WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV, which are operated as “satellite” stations of WAPA-TV. Stations granted satellite status are exempt from the FCC’s local television ownership rule. Thus, this status permits the common ownership of the three WAPA broadcast stations that would not otherwise be permitted. WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV were first accorded satellite status in 2001 due to the unique circumstances of the Puerto Rico market, including its topography and economic conditions, and the FCC has renewed this grant in subsequent transactions. We anticipate the FCC would continue to grant satellite status to WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV in future change-in-control transactions.

20



Foreign Ownership Restrictions
Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities, whom the FCC refers to as “aliens,” or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations.
Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity. Prior to 2013, the FCC had made such an affirmative finding with respect to broadcast licenses only in highly limited circumstances. In 2013, however, the FCC concluded that it should begin considering on a case-by-case basis requests for approval of acquisitions by aliens of in excess of 25% of the capital stock of the parent of a broadcast licensee. In 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify the process for submitting a declaratory ruling and modifying the procedures for the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast station licensees. These rules also specify how public companies should monitor foreign ownership compliance and provide for remedial provisions in the event a public company determines that it has exceeded its foreign ownership limits.
In considering a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC coordinates with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy issues. In October 2020, the FCC adopted rules to streamline the timing and improve the transparency of the required review of these requests by Executive Branch agencies. The FCC is also currently considering additional rules to further expedite this review process, including requiring licensees to respond to a standardized set of national security and law enforcement questions.
On January 18, 2017, the FCC granted our request to allow non-U.S. investors to own up to 49.99% of our capital stock and hold 49.99% of our voting power. Subsequently, on September 18, 2018, the FCC granted approval of additional specific non-U.S. equity and/or voting ownership interests in excess of 5%. On November 19, 2019, the FCC approved up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership of our equity and voting interests and approved the ownership of up to 49.99% of our capital stock and/or voting power by any one of several specifically approved non-U.S. investors. However, we remain subject to the requirement to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any other alien, in addition to the non U.S. investors that the FCC has previously approved in the series of declaratory ruling identified above, acquires more than 5% of our capital stock or more than 5% voting rights. We are also required to notify the FCC and take remedial actions as necessary, if we determine that an unapproved alien has acquired more than 5% of our capital stock or voting rights, and we may be subject to FCC enforcement action, including monetary forfeitures, if such a circumstance occurs.
To the extent necessary to comply with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, and the declaratory rulings, our board of directors may (i) prohibit the ownership, voting or transfer of any portion of our outstanding capital stock to the extent the ownership, voting or transfer of such portion would cause us to violate or would otherwise result in violation of any provision of the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory ruling; (ii) convert shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory rulings; and (iii) redeem capital stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory rulings or to prevent the loss or impairment of any of our FCC licenses.
Digital Television
As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasting allows stations to offer digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition video programming, multiple channels of standard definition video programming, such as WAPA Deportes, data, and other types of communications. Each station is required to provide at least one free over-the-air video program signal.

21



To the extent a station has “excess” digital capacity (i.e., digital capacity not used to transmit free, over-the-air video programming), it may elect to use that capacity in any manner consistent with FCC technical requirements, including for data transmission, interactive or subscription video services, or paging and information services. If a station uses its digital capacity to provide any such “ancillary or supplementary” services on a subscription or otherwise “feeable” basis, it must pay the FCC an annual fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues realized from such services.
In 2017, the FCC adopted rules authorizing the deployment of the Next Generation broadcast television transmission standard, also called ATSC 3.0. ATSC 3.0 is an Internet Protocol-based broadcast transmission platform that merges the capabilities of over-the-air broadcasting with the broadband viewing and information delivery methods of the Internet, using the same 6 MHz channels presently allocated for digital television service. Next Generation Television offers 4K ultra high definition video quality, enhanced sound quality, interactivity, mobile reception and advanced emergency messaging. Stations are not obligated to use ATSC 3.0; use of the new standard is voluntary. However, any station that decides to deploy the new standard will also be required to simulcast its primary program stream in the currently-used ATSC 1.0 format for a period of time as determined by the FCC. Television stations in many US television markets have voluntarily converted to ATSC 3.0 operations. In December 2021, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing rule changes which would clarify that a licensee's multicast streams that are broadcast by another host station as part of the conversion to ATSC 3.0 will be covered by the originating station's license. We cannot predict what impact the new standard will have on our Business.
MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals
A number of provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the relationship between broadcast television stations and distributors of multiple channels of video programming such as cable, satellite and telecommunications companies (referred to as “MVPDs”). The rules generally provide certain protections for local broadcast stations, for which MVPDs are an important means of distribution and a provider of competing program channels.
To ensure that every local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems and direct broadcast satellite operators transmit that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the so-called “must-carry” rule). Alternatively, a station may elect to forego its must-carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local MVPD—referred to as “retransmission consent.” A station electing retransmission consent assumes the risk that it will not be able to strike a deal with the MVPD and will not be carried. A station has the opportunity to elect must-carry or retransmission consent every three years. Elections were made in October 2020 for the 2021-2023 three-year period. WAPA elected retransmission consent and has entered into retransmission consent contracts with all MVPD systems serving Puerto Rico.
MVPDs are not required to carry any programming streams other than a station’s primary video programming channel. Consequently, WAPA’s multicast channel WAPA Deportes is not entitled to mandatory carriage under the FCC’s must-carry rules. However, we are free to negotiate with MVPDs for the carriage of additional programming streams.
In 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top four stations to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station, if the stations are not commonly owned and serve the same geographic market. Congress tightened this restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control as part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 enacted in December 2019 made permanent the statutory requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission agreements in good faith, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2019. In December 2014, the FCC issued a NPRM requesting comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include providers that make multiple linear streams of video programming available for purchase, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming (e.g. entities providing video programming to subscribers through internet connections). We cannot predict what impact, if any, this proceeding will have on our negotiations with video programming distributors. In March 2021, H.R. 1856, the Modern Television Act of 2021, was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill proposes to repeal retransmission consent requirements and compulsory copyright licenses and make other changes to copyright law and regulations governing negotiation of retransmission consent agreements. The bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce and House Judiciary committees; however, no hearings or other actions with respect to the bill have been scheduled.

Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses
Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorized the FCC to conduct voluntary “incentive auctions” in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to “repack” television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to an industry-wide total of $1.75 billion.
The FCC adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and conducted the auction. The incentive auction concluded in the first half of 2017. The FCC is now completing the process of "repacking" the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires that certain television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC is reimbursing stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. In March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking. Stations WNJX TV and WTIN TV were reassigned new channels as a result of the incentive auction. WNJX TV and WTIN TV transitioned to their new channels on August 1, 2018 and operated with temporary facilities until construction of their permanent facilities was completed in 2021. Both stations now hold licenses for permanent facilities on their post-transition channels.
The outcome of the repacking of broadcast television spectrum and the impact of such on WAPA's business, cannot be predicted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the auction will have a material negative impact on our Business, because our stations' post-transition channels are in the more desirable UHF band and our three television stations have overlapping coverage areas, so it is unlikely that we will lose service to a significant portion of the households that we serve. If the FCC is unable to reimburse all of our repacking expenses, the amount of the shortfall is unlikely to be material to our Business as a whole.
EEO Rules
The FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast television stations. Broadcasters are also subject to random audits to ensure compliance with the FCC’s EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance.
Recordkeeping
The FCC rules require broadcast television stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of the station’s operating parameters. Television stations must also maintain a public inspection file, which is hosted on an FCC maintained website and is therefore widely accessible by members of the public and the FCC. The FCC has recently increased enforcement of requirements regarding online public inspection files.
Programming and Operations
Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations, including WAPA, and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks.
Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity. Federal statutes prohibit the broadcast or transmission of obscene material at any time by broadcast television stations and on cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC’s rules also prohibit television stations, including the WAPA station, from broadcasting indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. In recent years, the FCC has intensified its enforcement activities with respect to programming it considers indecent and has issued numerous fines to licensees found to have violated the indecency rules.
The maximum permitted fine for an indecency violation is $445,445 per incident and $ 4,111,796 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act.

23



Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints on an ex parte basis, a licensee may not have knowledge of an indecency complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts a review of its indecency policy generally.
Children’s Programming. Federal statutes and FCC rules require broadcast television stations, including the WAPA station, to broadcast three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. In July 2019, the FCC adopted revisions to the children’s television programming rules, including the elimination of the requirement to air children’s programming on multicast programming streams, the expansion of the time period during which such programming can air, and requiring reporting to the FCC of such programming on an annual rather than a quarterly basis.
Federal statutes and FCC rules also limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be included in programming primarily produced and carried for children 12 years and younger by broadcast television stations and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC’s rules also limit the display, during children’s programming on broadcast stations and cable networks, of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.
Commercial Loudness. The 2010 Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (“CALM Act”) and the FCC rules implementing the CALM Act, require television stations, cable television operators, satellite television providers, and other pay television providers to limit the average volume of commercials, including promotional announcements, to the same average volume as the programming it accompanies. The FCC rules do not specifically require video programming providers, such as our U.S. Networks, to comply with the rules regarding the loudness of commercials. However, video programming distributors may request or require by contract that programming providers certify compliance with those rules for commercials embedded in programming.
Closed Captioning. FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations and carried on cable networks to contain closed captions. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast by television stations or transmitted by cable, including on our U.S. Networks, with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming on WAPA.TV. Clips of programming carried on television are required to be captioned if subsequently distributed over the internet. Additionally, beginning in March 2015, new FCC rules became effective that require programming captions to adhere to more stringent quality standards. In 2016, rules became effective requiring certain clips of programming made available online to be captioned if the underlying programming aired on television with captions.
Sponsorship Identification. Both the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast television station for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of broadcast. Cable systems are subject to the same requirement when the system is originating programming, also known as cablecasting. The FCC has recently increased enforcement of violations of its sponsorship identification requirements. Fines for such violations can be substantial because they are dependent on the number of times a particular advertisement is broadcast. In April 2021, the FCC adopted rules that will require broadcast stations to disclose when foreign governmental entities have paid a station directly or indirectly to broadcast programming under a lease time agreement. Broadcasters will be required to take certain actions to determine if an entity leasing airtime from it is covered by the new rules. Certain parties have asked the FCC to reconsider certain aspects of the proposed rules, and the National Association of Broadcasters has filed an appeal and a request that the new rules be stayed pending appeal.

Program Access Restrictions
Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms, or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC’s regulations. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated if it owns or is owned by a cable television operator, in whole or in part, under the FCC’s program access attribution rules. Cable television operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers. In November 2020, the FCC revised certain of its rules governing the resolution of complaints under the program access rules. Because certain of our directors are also directors of cable companies, we are considered to be a vertically integrated cable programmer and are subject to the program access rules.
Regulation of the Internet
Internet services, including PANTAYA.COM, WAPA.TV, CINELATINO.COM, TVPASIONES.COM, CENTROAMERICATV.TV, TELEVISIONDOMINICANA.TV and SNAPTV.TV, are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that limit the services we are able to offer. Our Internet services are also subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services.
Other Regulations
In addition to the regulations applicable to the broadcast, cable television and Internet industries in general, we are also subject to other federal, state, territorial, and local regulations, including, without limitation, regulations promulgated by federal, state, and territorial environmental, health and labor agencies. Cinelatino is also subject to laws and regulations that may be adopted or promulgated by the governments of other jurisdictions in which it operates.
