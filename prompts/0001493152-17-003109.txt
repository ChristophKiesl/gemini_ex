ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
1. Organizational History
 
The Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as “Vycor Medical LLC”. On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to “Vycor Medical, Inc.”. The Company’s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. (“NovaVision”) and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary, completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited (“Sight Science”), a previous competitor to NovaVision.
2. Overview of Business
 
Vycor is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct business units within the medical device industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage such as that caused by a stroke. Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. Both technologies have strong sales growth potential, address large potential markets and have the requisite regulatory approvals. The Company has 57 issued or allowed patents and a further 17 pending. The Company leverages joint resources across the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner.
 
The Company periodically engages in discussions with potential strategic partners for or purchasers of each or both of our operating divisions.
 
Vycor Medical
 
Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical’s ViewSite Brain Access System (“VBAS”) is a next generation retraction and access system that was fully commercialized in early 2010 and is the first significant technological change to brain tissue retraction in over 50 years in contrast to significant development in most other neuro-surgical technologies. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2003 compliant, and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, and regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Korea, Japan, Russia and Taiwan.
 

We believe VBAS offers several advantages over other brain retractor systems, commonly known as ribbon or blade retractors that are metallic, including having the potential to significantly reduce brain tissue trauma that arises from excessive pressure at the edges of the blade. The design of VBAS can minimize the size of the brain entry access necessary for surgical procedures, and is believed to significantly reduce the pressure and hence trauma on the surrounding brain tissue.
 
NovaVision
 
NovaVision provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation targeted at a substantial and largely un-addressed market of people who have lost their sight as a result of stroke or other brain injury. NovaVision addresses a significant target market, estimated at approximately $2 billion in each of the U.S. and the EU and over $13 billion globally.

NovaVision has a family of therapies that both restore and compensate for lost vision:
 

● | Restoration of vision: NovaVision’s VRT and Sight Science’s Neuro-Eye Therapy (NeET), aim to improve visual sensitivity in a person’s blind area. VRT delivers a series of light stimuli along the border of the patient’s visual field loss. These programmed light sequences stimulate the border zone between the “seeing” and “blind” visual fields, repetitively challenging the visual cortex in the border zone with a large number of stimuli over the course of time. NeET targets deep within the blind area by repeated stimulation, allowing patients to detect objects within the blind field. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Compensation and re-training: Normal eye movements are also affected after brain injury adding to the problems of blindness. NeuroEyeCoach provides a complementary therapy to VRT and NeET, which re-trains a patient to move their eyes, re-integrate left and right vision and to make the most of their remaining visual field. 

 
VRT and NeuroEyeCoach are therefore highly complementary and are provided in an Internet-delivered suite to ensure broad benefits to NovaVision’s patients.
 

NovaVision also has models of VRT and NeuroEyeCoach for physicians and rehabilitation clinics, as well as VIDIT, a diagnostic program that enables therapists to perform high-resolution visual field tests in less than ten minutes.
 
NovaVision’s VRT is the only medical device aimed at the restoration of vision lost as a result of neurological damage which has FDA 510(k) clearance to be marketed in the U.S; and NeuroEyeCoach is registered in the US as a Class I 510(k) exempt device. VRT, NEC and NeET have CE Marking for the EU. NovaVision has 41 granted and 2 pending patents worldwide.
 
Competition
 
The VBAS device is both a brain access system and a retractor and is therefore unique with no direct competitors. Competitive manufacturers of brain retractors include Cardinal Health (V. Mueller line), Aesculap, Integra Life Science and Codman (Division of Johnson & Johnson). Nico Corporation has a brain access device specifically designed to work with its Myriad resection and suction product.
 
NovaVision provides restoration therapies (VRT and NeET) and compensation or saccadic therapies (NeuroEyeCoach) for those suffering vision loss as a result of neurological trauma. The other therapy type for this condition is substitution (optical aids such as prisms) and is not considered by NovaVision as competition.
 
In restoration, competition has been reduced through NovaVision’s acquisition of Sight Science and there are a few very small companies or entities offering some form of vision rehabilitation product in Germany. Within compensation there are no real direct competitors. Other companies in the general rehabilitation space include RevitalVision, PositScience and Dynavision. In the professional market, NovaVision competes with aggregator products or those that provide a range of non-specific therapies, such a Rehacom, Sanet Vision Integrator and Bioness BITS. NovaVision’s products are dedicated to vision.
 
The Market For the Company’s Products And Therapies
 
VBAS is used for craniotomy procedures. Based on statistics from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), management estimates 700,000 such procedures are performed in the US annually. Of this, management believe approximately 225,000 (32 percent) are addressable by the VBAS range currently, with another 100,000 (total of 325,000 or 46 percent) addressable by an expanded future range. Management estimates, for the global market, there exists a current addressable market of approximately 1,100,000 procedures with another 500,000 addressable by an expanded VBAS range.
 
The market for NovaVision’s therapies comprises those suffering from vision loss resulting from neurological trauma such as stroke or other brain injury. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates there are approximately 8 million Americans who have previously had a stroke incident, with 795,000 additional strokes occurring annually; adjusting for repeat strokes and deaths, there are 481,000 new stroke survivors each year. Additionally, approximately 5.3 million Americans live with the long-term effects of a TBI, with 275,000 hospitalizations each year. The most recent scientific research estimates that approximately 28.5% experience some visual impediment and 20.5% of these patients experience a permanent visual field deficit, reducing mobility and other activities of daily living. The target market for VRT and NeET is this 20.5% subset of patients who have suffered a permanent visual field deficit; NeuroEyeCoach addresses all 28.5% of patients who experience visual impediments. Management estimates that the addressable target market for its therapies is approximately 2.9 million people in the US, approximately 2.8 million people in Europe and approximately 12.9 million people throughout the rest of the world.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Vycor Medical
 
Vycor Medical’s growth strategy includes:
 
1. Increasing U.S. market penetration through broader hospital coverage and targeted direct physician marketing. Vycor Medical’s sales and marketing strategy is to penetrate a well-defined target market of 4,500 neurosurgeons. Vycor markets direct to surgeons as well as marketing and distributing through independent distributors, with a focus both on adding new hospitals and expanding to additional surgeons in hospitals where VBAS is already approved, and to expand usage to a broader range of procedures. In order to expand its direct marketing and deepening its penetration, Vycor is exploring the creation of a Centers of Excellence medical education campaign and to that end has developed new surgeon education and training materials including detailed videos produced with surgeons at Weill Cornell. Vycor is pursuing a policy of continually evaluating and upgrading its distributors as well as adding additional distributors in regions where it has little to no presence.

2. Provision of more Clinical and Scientific Data supporting the products superiority over the current standard-of-care blade retractors and to demonstrate VBAS’ potential for cost savings. Clinical and scientific data (in the form of peer reviewed articles, clinical studies and other reports and case studies) are critical in driving adoption, and in turn revenues, further and faster by demonstrating VBAS’ superiority as a minimally invasive access system that helps VBAS move further up the hospital cost/benefit curve. To date the Company has already had 10 Peer Reviewed studies and 4 other clinical papers and anticipates further studies to be published.
 
3. International Market Growth
 
Vycor Medical utilizes select medical device distributors with experience in neurosurgical devices in their countries or regions. VBAS has full regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (EU – Class III), Korea, Japan and Taiwan and is seeking or has partial regulatory approvals in India, Russia and Vietnam. Vycor Medical is actively pursuing new distribution agreements in the countries where it does not have any market presence.
4. New Product Development
 
New Product Development is targeted at both driving the use of its existing VBAS product range through ancillary products and modalities that will facilitate the product’s use and through new product extensions to broaden VBAS applicability to procedures currently not addressed by the existing product line.
 
Vycor is modifying its existing VBAS product suite to make it more easy to integrate with Image Guidance Systems (IGS) by re-engineering VBAS so that the entire range of 12 devices, excluding the VBASmini, will be able to more easily accommodate pointers from a range of IGS manufacturers. Increasingly, all major neuro centers have image guidance systems, and where this is in place management believes over 90% of surgeries are carried out using IGS and management strongly believes that the existing VBAS rigid structure lends itself well to being incorporated into this increasing trend.
 
NovaVision
 
While speech, physical, and occupational therapies are the long-standing treatment standards for stroke and TBI survivors, VRT is the first and only FDA-cleared clinical component of vision restoration to physically enhance the visual field after a stroke or brain injury. Increasingly the healthcare community, partly driven by strong lobbying by stroke associations worldwide, are recognizing that vision is not only a significant issue post stroke or brain injury, but that visual field loss can have a significant impact on the success of other rehabilitation modalities and the quality of life.
 
Our strategic vision for NovaVision has been to develop and provide a clinically supported, affordable and scalable visual therapy solution offering that provides broad benefits to those suffering visual impairment following neurological brain damage; and to offer solutions for both patients and medical professionals alike. Following a prolonged development program, aimed at broadening patient benefits, significantly reducing cost and making our therapies affordable and scalable, NovaVision was able to launch its Internet-delivered therapy suite in the US in June 2015 and in Europe in December 2015.
 
NovaVision has four routes-to-market aimed at patients and professionals, comprising: direct-to-patient; rehabilitation centers and clinics; stroke associations and support groups; and physicians. Given the company’s limited resources NovaVision is initially focusing on direct-to-patient, with a website lead-driven inbound and outbound marketing strategy targeted at prospective patients and relatives. Website metrics – particularly for the US and more recently Germany – are positive, although below management’s expectations, showing good growth in traffic and rankings, and have been effective in generating leads. Our analysis of the campaign metrics in the US (including Google Ads) during 2016 highlighted some key improvements that needed to be implemented which we are carrying out and which we believe could have a material impact on our lead generation.
 
Following the pilot launch of our NovaVision Center Model, comprising the Vision Diagnostics program and the NeuroEyeCoach training program, we are substantially broadening the delivery and licensing model in response to feedback from clinics. The new Center Model has a complete suite for the professional market, including options for software download, CD Rom, Cloud based and Hardware delivery with flexible and cost-effective pricing options, and is now being offered in both the US and Europe.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Vycor Medical uses a sub-contract manufacturer to manufacture, package, label and sterilize its VBAS products. The Company has migrated all its VBAS manufacturing to Life Science Outsourcing, Inc. in Brea, California that is FDA-registered and meets ISO standards and certifications.

3. Other Matters
 
Product Liability Insurance
 
We presently have Product Liability insurance for both Vycor Medical and NovaVision.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are committed to an integrated total quality management system. We believe that we have completed the necessary procedures and Vycor Medical is certified to the ISO standards expected of medical device manufacturers as follows:
ISO 13485:2003 Medical Devices — Quality Management Systems
 
The certification of a quality management system to ISO 13485, specifically for medical devices, is advantageous and often essential for medical companies to export their products to the global market, as well as maintain and enter into certain agreements and business growth opportunities within the U.S. For example, Canada requires that medical device manufacturers marketing their products in Canada must have a quality system certified to ISO 13485:2003. The certification is also required for placement of branded devices into the European Union.
 Vycor Medical has the following certification/licensing:
 

● | Fully Quality Assurance System Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (3) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | EC Design-Examination Certificate Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (4) 
● | ISO 13485.2003 

Continuing Regulatory Requirements
 

● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

 
Vycor Medical’s products have been classified as Class II products by the FDA and cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process. NovaVision’s VRT product has been cleared as a Class U product through the 510(k) while its NeuroEyeCoach is registered as an exempt Class 1 device.
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, and failure to respond to requested corrective actions on an ongoing basis, can result in enforcement action by the FDA.
 
Medical device laws are also in effect in many of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval and quality system requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simple requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In June 1998, the European Union Medical Device Directive became effective, and all medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive CE mark certification. CE mark certification involves a comprehensive Quality System program, and submission of data on a product to the Notified Body in Europe.
 
Vycor Medical has obtained the CE marking approval to allow for distribution of its VBAS products in Europe as a Class III device and has received HPB licensing approval for distribution in Canada as a Class II device. VBAS also has full regulatory or partial approvals in Australia, Brazil, China, Korea, Japan and Russia. NovaVison’s VRT, NeuroEyeCoach and Sight Science’s NeET have CE mark registrations as Class I devices in Europe.
