Item 1. Business
 
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. (“Ballantyne Strong”, the “Company”, “us” or “we”), a Delaware corporation established in 1932, went public in 1995. Our shares are traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol “BTN.” Our website is www.ballantynestrong.com. The inclusion of our Internet address in this Annual Report does not include or incorporate by reference into this Annual Report any information on our website. At our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a proposal to approve an amendment and restatement to our Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name from Ballantyne Strong, Inc. to FG Group Holdings Inc. was approved. Although we have not yet implemented the change to our corporate name, we intend to do so during the first half of 2022.
 
We operate Strong Entertainment, which has a leadership position in supplying projection screens and related products and services to the cinema exhibition and entertainment industry. We have capital allocated to equity holdings in three independent companies, one of which is a private venture-backed company and two are publicly traded companies. We also operate a technology incubator and co-working facility in Alpharetta, Georgia where, effective February 1, 2022, we also own the land and buildings.
 
Our strategic plans contemplate a combination of:
 

● | Expanding our Strong Entertainment operating business, organically and though complimentary transactions following a planned separation and initial public offering; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Maximizing the value of our holdings by strategically allocating additional capital, monetizing positions, and redeploying capital; and 
● | Managing public company costs to minimize overhead levels of the Ballantyne Strong holding company. 

 
We believe Strong Entertainment has established a leadership position in the entertainment industry, providing mission critical products and services to cinema exhibitors and entertainment venues for over 80 years. We intend to focus on growing and increasing the scope, scale and value of our Strong Entertainment operating business.
 
Over the past 18 months, we have been focused on improving operating performance and positioning the group for accelerated growth following a period of COVID-19 related industry disruptions. Entering 2022, management is focused on growth opportunities, including a combination of organic growth and expansion through strategic transactions in the Entertainment business.
 
As part of that strategy, the Company announced plans to establish the Strong Entertainment business as a separate publicly listed company. Following the planned separation, the operations of the Strong Entertainment operating segment are expected to become part of a newly established British Columbia corporation, Strong Global Entertainment, Inc. (“Strong Global Entertainment”). Strong Global Entertainment plans to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and intends to commence an initial public offering of its common shares during 2022 to raise additional capital to support its growth plans. If successful, we expect to apply to have the Strong Global Entertainment common shares trade on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “SGE” following the initial public offering, and the Company would expect to continue to be the majority shareholder of Strong Global Entertainment.


The Company also continues to evaluate opportunities to allocate capital. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held equity stakes in three separate companies. Firefly Systems, Inc. (“Firefly”) operates a media network and digital advertising solutions on taxi and rideshare vehicles. FG Financial Group, Inc. (“FGF”) operates as a diversified insurance, reinsurance and investment management holding company, and GreenFirst Forest Products Inc (“GreenFirst”), recently completed a series of transactions making it one of the largest producers in the Canadian timber market. In February 2022, subsequent to the end of the year, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ignition, LLC, completed the purchase of the land and building housing its Digital Ignition business in Alpharetta, Georgia.


Fundamental Global GP, LLC (“Fundamental Global”), the funds that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates together held approximately 33.6% of the Company’s outstanding stock as of March 15, 2022. In some cases, funds managed by Fundamental Global may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global’s funds currently hold positions in FGF and GreenFirst.

Strong Entertainment Overview
 
As noted above, we recently announced plans to establish the Strong Entertainment business as a separate publicly listed company. Following the planned separation, the operations of our Strong Entertainment operating segment are expected to become part of a newly established British Columbia corporation, Strong Global Entertainment. The information provided below describes the historical operation of our Strong Entertainment business segment, rather than as a standalone operating company.
Overview
 
Our Strong Entertainment business segment manufactures and distributes premium large format projection screens and provides technical support services and other related products and services to the cinema exhibition industry, theme parks, schools, museums and other entertainment-related markets. We also distribute and support third party products, including digital projectors, servers, library management systems, menu boards and sound systems.
 
As a manufacturer and distributor of projection screens systems, we have contractual relationships to supply projection screens to major cinema exhibitors, including IMAX Corporation (“IMAX”), AMC Entertainment Holdings (“AMC”), and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (“Cinemark”), and other cinema operators worldwide. In addition to traditional projection screens, we also manufacture and distribute our Eclipse curvilinear screens, which are specially designed for theme parks, immersive exhibitions, as well as simulation applications.
 
We also provide maintenance, repair, installation, network support services and other services to cinema operators, primarily in the United States. Many of our customers choose annual managed service arrangements for maintenance and repair services. We also provide maintenance services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our field service and Network Operations Center (“NOC”) staff work hand in hand to monitor and resolve system and other issues for our customers. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems technicians, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems’ issues before they cause system failures.
 
We recently launched Strong Studios, Inc., (“Strong Studios”) a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Strong Technical Services, Inc. (“STS”). The goal in launching Strong Studios is to expand our Entertainment Business to include content creation and production of feature films and series. The launch of Strong Studios is intended to further diversify our revenue streams and increase our addressable markets, while leveraging our existing relationships in the industry.
 
The coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) and inflationary pressures have been posing and may continue to pose challenges for our business. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant impact to our customers and their ability and willingness to purchase our products and services. A significant number of our customers temporarily ceased operations at times during the pandemic, some of which continue to operate under COVID-19 restrictions. As such, we have experienced, and may continue to experience an impact on our results of operations.
 
Products and Services
 
Projection Screens and Support Systems — We believe we are the largest manufacturer and distributor of premium large format projection screens to the cinema industry in North America. We have contractual relationships to supply projection screens to major cinema exhibitors, including IMAX Corporation (“IMAX”) and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (“Cinemark”), and other cinema operators worldwide. We also manufacture innovative screen support structures custom built to adapt to virtually any venue requirement, with a unique self-standing modular construction that allows for easy assembly and adjustable size.
 
In addition to traditional projection screens, we also manufacture and distribute our Eclipse curvilinear screens, which are specially designed for theme parks, immersive exhibitions, as well as simulation applications. Our Eclipse curvilinear screens are specially designed to provide maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. The solid surface minimizes light loss to maintain higher resolution at lower lumen output. Patented speaker panels allow selective placement of rear mounted speakers to ensure the audio derives from the source media on screen. Applications include interactive dark rides, 3D/4D theme park rides, flying theaters and motion simulators.
 
We believe that our screens are the highest quality in the industry providing the highest gain and other characteristics important to the exhibitor and its patrons. Our high quality is driven by our innovative manufacturing process, focus on quality control and our proprietary coatings. We believe we are the only major screen manufacturer that develops and produces its own proprietary coatings, which are critical to the overall quality, increased screen reflectivity and brightness, and continued innovation of our screens.
 
Technical Services – We provide digital projection equipment installation and after-sale maintenance and network support services to the entertainment industry. Our field service technicians and NOC staff work hand in hand to monitor and resolve system and other issues for our customers. We service many of our customers under recurring revenue contracts providing for maintenance and repair to a wide range of installed digital equipment, providing our customers with a reliable turnkey outsourced service option. We also provide services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems’ issues before they cause system failures.

Content - We recently launched our Strong Studios division, expanding our Entertainment Business to include content creation and production of feature films and series. The launch of Strong Studios further diversifies our revenue streams and increases our addressable markets, while leveraging our existing relationships in the industry. While Strong Studios has not started any substantive operations, it has acquired, from Landmark, an unrelated party, original feature films and television series, as well as been assigned third party rights to content for global multiplatform distribution.
 
Other Products – We distribute projectors, servers, audio systems and other third-party products including library management systems, lenses and lamps to customers in North and South America.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia. Screen systems are primarily sold on a direct basis, although we also use third-party distributors and integrators in some markets.
 
We have non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and Barco that allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America. Recently, we announced that we entered into a preferred commercial relationship with Cinionic, Inc., the world’s leading provider of laser cinema solutions, to enhance the services to operators across North America. We believe this relationship enhances our ability to service our valued customers by providing increased access to technology, better training for our technicians and will strengthen our global reach due to closer relationships with their international sales teams.
 
We provide technical services in the United States. We market and sell our services both directly to theater owners and other entertainment-related markets and through dealers or Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) networks.
 
Competition
 
There are several other companies that manufacture and distribute projection screens. We believe that our primary competitors in the worldwide projection screen market include Harkness Screens International Ltd., Severtson, Screen Solutions, Spectro, MECHANISCHE Weberei BOHEMIA s.r.o. and Galalite Projection Screens. Competitive factors include product performance characteristics, quality, availability, location/shipping logistics and price.
 
The market for our other digital cinema equipment and technical services is highly competitive, and the industry is fragmented. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes other integrators and resellers. Manufacturers may also sell equipment directly to exhibitors, especially for large orders. We believe that our primary competition for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., Moving Image Technologies Tri-State Digital Services and Sonic Equipment Company. We also compete with in-house technical resources at some of our larger entertainment customers for services work.
 
Recent Developments
 
During February 2022, we launched Strong Studios. Strong Studios has acquired, from Landmark Studios, Inc (“Landmark”), a subsidiary of Chicken Soup of the Soul Entertainment, original feature films and television series, as well as been assigned third party rights to content for global multiplatform distribution.
Equity Holdings
 
The Company holds equity stakes in two public companies. The Company holds approximately 25% of FG Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: FGF) (“FGF”), a reinsurance and investment management holding company focused on opportunistic collateralized and loss capped reinsurance, while allocating capital to SPAC and SPAC sponsor-related businesses; and approximately 9% of GreenFirst Forest Products Inc. (TSX: GFP) (“GreenFirst”), a forest-first business focused on sustainable forest management and lumber production. The Company also holds preferred shares in a private company, Firefly Systems, Inc. (“Firefly”), which operates a media network and digital advertising solutions on taxi and rideshare vehicles. We sold our Strong Outdoor business to Firefly in August 2020.

Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations
 
Our top ten customers accounted for 38% of 2021 consolidated net revenues. Trade accounts receivable from these customers represented 29% of net consolidated receivables at December 31, 2021. None of our customers accounted for more than 10% of both our consolidated net revenues during 2021 and our net consolidated receivables as of December 31, 2021.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture cinema screens through Strong/MDI Screen Systems, Inc. (“Strong/MDI”), our subsidiary in Joliette, Quebec, Canada. These manufacturing operations consist of an approximately 80,000 square-foot facility for the manufacture of screen systems. These facilities include PVC welding operations with programmable automations, as well as two 90-foot high screen coating towers with state-of-the-art precision coating application software and painting systems. This world class ISO certified operation has the capability of manufacturing multiple standard screens simultaneously to large format 2D and 3D screens for cinema and special venue applications.
Quality Control
 
We believe that our quality control procedures and the quality standards for the products that we manufacture, distribute or service have contributed significantly to our reputation for high performance and reliability. The inspection of incoming materials and components as well as the testing of all of our products during various stages of the sales and service cycle are key elements of this program.
Trademarks
 
We own or otherwise have rights to various trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with the sale of our products. We believe our success will not be dependent upon trademark protection, but rather upon our scientific and engineering capabilities and research and production techniques. We consider the Strong® trademark to be of value to our business.
Human Capital Resources
 
We employed 159 persons at December 31, 2021, 158 of which were full-time. Of these employees, 74 positions were considered manufacturing or operational, 44 were service related and 41 were considered sales and administrative. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
 
The Company believes it complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status. We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees.
 
The Company, including its subsidiaries, remains deeply rooted in cinema screen manufacturing and cinema-focused services. In this regard, we continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our stockholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees.
 
Moreover, the Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health requirements; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.
 
Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.
