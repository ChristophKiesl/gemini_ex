  Item 1. Business
  
  Business Overview
  
 We are a Nevada corporation organized under the name Solid Solar Energy, Inc in 2008 and renamed Exactus, Inc. in 2016. We have pursued opportunities in Cannabidiol, which we refer to as CBD, since 2019.
  
 In December 2018, we expanded our focus to pursue opportunities in hemp-derived CBD. This decision was based in part on the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill, known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which will remain in force through 2023. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the production of hemp and removed hemp and hemp seeds from the Drug Enforcement Administration’s, or the DEA’s, schedule of Controlled Substances. It also directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, to issue regulations and guidance to implement a program to create a consistent regulatory framework around production of hemp throughout the United states. On October 31, 2019, the USDA, Agricultural Marketing Services, issued an interim final rule (with request for comments). The rule outlines provisions for the USDA to approve plans submitted by states and Indian tribes. The U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program establishes federal regulatory oversight of the production of hemp in the U.S. The program authorizes the USDA to approve plans submitted by states and Indian tribes for the domestic production of hemp and establishes a federal plan for producers in states or territories that choose not to administer a state or tribe specific plan, provide the state or tribe does not ban hemp production.
  
 Our principal executive offices were located at 80 NE 4th Avenue, Suite 28 Delray Beach, FL 33483 until mid-2020 when we commenced remote operations due to Covid-19, and our telephone number is (800) 881-9352.
  
  Farming Operations
  
 During most of 2020 we were engaged in marketing of hemp derived products sourced from our leased farming operations. Through our majority-owned subsidiary, Exactus One World, LLC (“EOW”) we held one-year leases, for approximately 200 acres of farmland in southwest Oregon for growing hemp. Our initial efforts to pursue agricultural development, including farm soil preparation, planting, harvesting, transportation and drying, were situated at farms from which we shipped hemp biomass to third parties for processing. Due to a rapid decline in commodity prices for industrial hemp experienced during 2020 we suspended all farming operations during 2020, and entered into a supply agreement with Hemptown USA, Inc. to provide us with industrial hemp.
 Industrial Hemp
  
 We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to utilize the production of cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp, such as CBD, CBG and CBN, to produce consumer products. Hemp is being used in cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and animal feed, where we also intend to focus our efforts. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years.
  
 The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is attributable to the valuable overlap between phyto-cannabinoids (i.e. plant-derived cannabinoids) and the endogenous cannabinoid system in humans, termed a “therapeutic handshake”. Clinical trials demonstrate few adverse effects from oral CBD doses of up to 1,500 mg/day or up to 30 mg IV. The scientific understanding of CBD’s clinical effects is based mostly on studies in specific indications, like epilepsy. One company, GW Pharmaceuticals pls, a leading company developing pharmaceutical drugs and cannabinoid-based medicines, has sought and obtained US and foreign approvals since 2018. EPIDIOLEX®/EPIDYOLEX® (cannabidiol), the first prescription, plant-derived cannabis-based medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. and the European Commission (EC) for use in Europe, is an oral solution which contains highly purified cannabidiol (CBD). In the U.S., EPIDIOLEX® is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome or Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) in patients one year of age and older. EPIDIOLEX® has received approval in the European Union under the tradename EPIDYOLEX® for adjunctive use in conjunction with clobazam to treat seizures associated with LGS and Dravet syndrome in patients two years and older. In September 2020, EPIDYOLEX® was approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in Australia for the treatment of seizures associated with LGS or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. EPIDYOLEX® has received Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of seizures associated TSC.

  Healthcare
  
 Currently, CBD products are not a covered benefit, or an extra benefit, under managed care, insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or any state programs. This will likely continue to be the case for the intermediate term. Legal issues and confusion concerning legality, lack of FDA regulation and availability as an OTC medication will likely continue for an indefinite period impeding adoption and payor acceptance.
 Competition
  
 We believe a multitude (hundreds) of companies, large and small, have launched or intend to launch retail brands and white label products containing cannabinoids like CBD. Many of these are dependent upon third parties to provide raw material inventory for sale. We believe this makes many of the participants in the industry vulnerable to shortages, quality issues, reliability, and pricing variability. Our industry relationships may allow us to build an efficient supply chain that will put us among the few companies that maintain a competitive pricing and supply advantage.
  
 The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which are under-capitalized. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products including large agribusiness companies such as Cargill and Tyson Foods, but may do so in the future and become significant competitors.
  
  Our goal is to rapidly establish one or more principal sources of supply and to develop wholesale and retail sales channels for end-products, such as nutraceuticals, supplements and pet and farm products.
 
  Environmental Matters
  
 Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any direct material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, however such factors could indirectly affect us as well as participants in the supply chain for our products, and our business, operations, vendors or suppliers.
