On November 1, 2020, in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Agreement, dated March 24, 2020, among the Company, Cantek and the Cantek Shareholders (the “Exchange Agreement”), the Company and Cantek mutually agreed to immediately reverse the transactions thereunder. Under the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Cantek in exchange for the issuance of 26,349,800 shares of common stock of the Company to the Cantek Shareholders and the Company’s commitment to issue 4,115,020 shares of preferred stock of the Company, each convertible into ten shares of Common Stock of the Company to the Cantek Shareholders in the future (the “Exchange Agreement”) and reversed the transactions contemplated thereby. As a result, the Company no longer has any ownership or other interest in Cantek and the Cantek Shareholders no longer have any ownership interest in the Company.
 
As previously disclosed in the current report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on March 24, 2020 (the “March 24 8-K”), the Company (i) entered into a rescission agreement (the “Rescission Agreement”) with Corette, LLC (“Corette”) pursuant to which the acquisition by the Company of Solstice Marketing Concepts LLC was rescinded and rendered void ab initio and (ii) the $1,200,000 convertible note (the “Note”) issued by the Company to Shaidim Enterprises, LLC (“Shaidim”) was assumed by Fairway, LLC, an affiliate of Corette.
 
Contrary to what the Company understood at the time of the March 24 8-K, Shaidim formally declared on July 20, 2020 that it did not, in fact, consent to the assignment of the Note. Therefore, the Note remains a direct obligation of the Company. As a further result of the lack of consent from Shaidim to assign the Note to Fairway, (i) the Company is in breach of its obligation under the Rescission Agreement to obtain the written consent of Shaidim to such assignment and (ii) the Company is breach of its representations and warranties to Cantek and the Cantek Shareholders under the Exchange Agreement.
 
The Company was recently advised that on July 9, 2021 Shaidim signed an agreement with Fairway LLC, in which Shaidim expressly recognized that although it initially rejected the rescission agreement whereby Corette LLC undid its conveyance of Fairway to the Company, and the substitution of a Fairway note for the Note, Shaidim agreed to forego any such claims against the Company in favor of a cash settlement from Fairway. The Company was further advised that Shaidim was fully repaid in August 2021 and has no further claims of any nature in respect of the Note.
 
Kinetic Group Inc. is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (June 6, 2014) have been considered as part of the Company’s development stage activities.
 
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.
 
The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage.
 
For public business entities, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Kinetic Group has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the company to remove the inception to date information and all references to development stage.
