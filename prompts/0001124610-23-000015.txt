ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
VMware, Inc. (“VMware” or the “Company”) originally pioneered the development and application of virtualization technologies with x86 server-based computing, separating application software from the underlying hardware, and then evolved to become the private cloud and mobility management leader. Building upon that leadership, VMware is focused on becoming the multi-cloud leader. Information technology (“IT”) driven innovation continues to disrupt markets and industries. Technologies emerge faster than organizations can absorb, creating increasingly complex environments. Organizations’ IT departments and corporate divisions are working at an accelerated pace to harness new technologies, platforms and cloud models, ultimately guiding businesses and their product teams through a digital transformation. To take on these challenges, we are helping customers drive their multi-cloud strategy by providing the multi-cloud platform for all applications, enabling digital innovation and enterprise control. 
Our multi-cloud portfolio, spanning application modernization, cloud management, cloud infrastructure, networking, security and anywhere workspaces, forms a flexible, consistent digital foundation on which customers can build, run, manage, connect and protect their mission-critical workloads. 
We incorporated in Delaware in 1998 and were acquired by EMC Corporation (“EMC”) in 2004. In August 2007, we conducted an initial public offering of our Class A common stock (“Class A Stock”) but remained majority-owned by EMC, the sole stockholder of our Class B common stock (“Class B Stock”). In September 2016, Dell Technologies Inc. (“Dell”) acquired EMC, and we became a majority-owned subsidiary of Dell. In November 2021, our spin-off from Dell was completed, each share of Class B Stock converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Stock and we became a standalone company (the “Spin-Off”). In connection with the Spin-Off, we paid an $11.5 billion cash dividend, pro rata, to each of the holders of our Class A Stock and Class B Stock as of the close of business on October 29, 2021 (the “Special Dividend”). 
On May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Class A Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of Class A Stock, and subject to proration in accordance with the Merger Agreement as described below: (i) $142.50 per share in cash, without interest, or (ii) 0.25200 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Broadcom. The transaction, which is expected to be consummated in Broadcom’s fiscal year 2023, was approved by VMware shareholders at a special meeting held on November 4, 2022 but remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. On February 17, 2023, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, the Company and Broadcom each delivered to the other a mutual notice to extend the Outside Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to May 26, 2023. If the Closing Effective Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has not occurred, similar three-month extensions could be noticed by either party (or mutually) five business days prior to each of May 26 and August 26, 2023. If the transaction is consummated, our Class A Stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Refer to Note A to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday nearest to January 31 of each year. We refer to our fiscal years ending February 3, 2023, January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021 as “fiscal 2023,” “fiscal 2022,” and “fiscal 2021,” respectively. Fiscal 2023 was a 53-week fiscal year, while fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were each 52-week fiscal years. 
Total revenue in fiscal 2023 increased 4% to $13.4 billion. Total revenue is comprised of license revenue of $2.8 billion, subscription and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) revenue of $4.0 billion and services revenue of $6.5 billion. As customers shift from our on-premises offerings to our subscription and SaaS offerings, license revenue and software maintenance revenue may be lower and subject to greater fluctuation in the future, resulting from a higher proportion of our sales occurring through our subscription and SaaS offerings.
Our corporate headquarters are located at 3401 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, California, and we have 114 offices worldwide.

We also have strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and we invest in joint research with academia.
We prioritize our product development efforts through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. Our R&D culture places a high value on innovation, quality and open collaboration with our partners. We currently participate in numerous open source communities, and our employees hold a variety of leadership positions within those open source communities.
We continue to invest in our key growth areas while also investing in areas that we expect to be significant growth drivers in future periods. 
Sales and Marketing
Our go-to-market efforts include a direct sales force, including a specialized sales force for our key growth offerings, and our channel and cloud partners.
We have well-established, ongoing business relationships with our distributors. Our distributors purchase software licenses and software support from us for resale to end-user customers via resellers. These resellers are part of VMware Partner Connect, a program which offers resellers pricing incentives, rebates, sales and product enablement through the VMware Partner Connect web portal and access to the worldwide network of VMware distributors. In addition, our channel partner network includes certain systems integrators and resellers trained and certified to deliver consulting services and solutions leveraging our products. Our channel network also includes partners that host our products and deliver them as-a-service to customers. 
We generally do not have long-term contracts or minimum-purchase commitments with our distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators and our contracts with these channel partners do not prohibit them from offering products or services that compete with ours.
End users can purchase the full breadth of our subscription, SaaS, license and services portfolio through discrete purchases or through enterprise agreements (“EAs”), both of which provide access to a range of flexible purchasing programs. EAs are sold to our direct customers and through channel partners and can include our license, multi-year maintenance and support, subscription and SaaS offerings. EAs enable us to build long-term relationships with our customers as they commit to our virtual infrastructure solutions. Our sales cycle varies depending on numerous factors, including the size and complexity of the proposed offering and a customer’s infrastructure footprint.
In establishing list prices for our solutions, we take into account, among other numerous factors, the value our solutions deliver and the cost of alternative virtualization, end-user computing, hardware, cloud native and security solutions.
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers and users, distributors, resellers, system vendors, systems integrators, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative offerings. We raise awareness of our company and brands, market our products and generate sales leads through VMware and industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, advertising, direct marketing, social media initiatives, free downloads and trials and our website. We have invested in multiple online communities that enable customers and partners to share and discuss sales and development resources, best practices implementation and industry trends among other topics. Our annual user and partner conference, VMware Explore (formerly VMworld) is a global event. We also offer management presentations, seminars and webinars on our solutions and services. We believe the combination of these activities strengthens our brand and enhances our leadership in the industries in which we compete.
In connection with the Spin-Off, we and Dell entered into the Commercial Framework Agreement to provide a framework under which we and Dell have continued our strategic commercial relationship, particularly with respect to projects mutually agreed as having the potential to accelerate the growth of an industry, product, service or platform that may provide a strategic market opportunity. The Commercial Framework Agreement has an initial term of five years, with automatic one-year renewals occurring annually thereafter, subject to certain terms and conditions. Bookings through Dell sales channels in aggregate comprise the largest route-to-market for our sales. 
We also have strategic partnerships with AWS, Google, IBM and Microsoft to jointly provide the expertise, solutions and go-to-market capabilities to help our customers efficiently and more securely extend their proven software-defined solutions into public clouds, utilizing the tools and processes with which our customers are already familiar.
Our business and the sales of our products and services are subject to seasonality. For example, our fourth quarter sales are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including year-end spending trends, that impact the timing of renewals of our EAs and support and maintenance contracts.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate amount of the transaction price in contracts allocated to performance obligations not delivered, or partially undelivered, as of the end of the reporting period. Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue, multi-year contracts with future installment payments and certain unfulfilled orders against accepted, non-cancellable customer contracts at the end of any given period.
As of February 3, 2023, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $13.6 billion, of which approximately 54% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter.
As of January 28, 2022, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $12.0 billion, of which approximately 57% was expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal 2023 and the remainder thereafter.
Remaining performance obligations did not include customer prepayments received for contracts that include certain cancellation rights, such as termination for convenience, which were included in customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets and were $681 million as of February 3, 2023.
Backlog
Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled purchase orders or unfulfilled executed agreements at the end of a given period and is net of related estimated rebates and marketing development funds. Backlog consists of licenses, subscription and SaaS and services. As of February 3, 2023, our total backlog was $72 million, substantially all of which consisted of orders received on
the last day of the quarter that were not shipped or provisioned to customers, and orders held due to our export control process. Backlog related to license was not material as of February 3, 2023. Backlog excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts are subject to cancellation until the performance obligation is fulfilled was not material as of February 3, 2023.
As of January 28, 2022, our total backlog was $88 million and our backlog related to licenses was $14 million. For our backlog related to licenses, we generally expect to deliver and recognize revenue during the following quarter. Backlog totaling $36 million as of January 28, 2022 was excluded from the remaining performance obligations because such contracts are subject to cancellation until the performance obligation is fulfilled. 
The amount and composition of backlog will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount of backlog is indicative of future sales or revenue or that the mix of backlog at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products or services.
Customers
Our product offerings allow customers to manage IT resources across private clouds and complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. Customer deployments range in size from a single virtualized server for small businesses to thousands of virtual machines and managed devices for our largest enterprise customers.
During fiscal 2023, revenue from Dell, including purchases of products and services directly from us, as well as through our channel partners, accounted for 38% of our consolidated revenue. These purchases included Dell selling joint solutions as an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”), which accounted for 14% of total revenue from Dell, or 5% of our consolidated revenue. The remaining revenue from Dell consisted of Dell acting as a distributor to other non-Dell resellers, reselling products and services as a reseller or purchasing products and services for its own internal use. On certain transactions, Dell Financial Services (“DFS”) also provided financing to our end users at our end users’ discretion. 
Other than Dell, none of our distributors accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during fiscal 2023. Our distribution agreements are typically terminable at will by either party upon 30 to 90 days prior written notice to the other party and neither party has any obligation to purchase or sell any products under the agreement.
Competition
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services. We believe that the key factors in our ability to successfully compete include the level of reliability, interoperability and new functionality of our product and service offerings; the ability of our product offerings to support multiple hardware platforms, operating systems, applications frameworks and public cloud platforms; our ability to anticipate customer needs in rapidly evolving markets for IT resources; the pricing of our product and service offerings; the ability to integrate open source technologies that are critical in private and public cloud computing architectures; the ability to attract and retain key employees; and the ability to maintain and expand our ecosystem of technology partners, service providers and sales channel partners. While we believe that we are a technology leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions and have a strong, favorable image with our customers, many of our current or potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Additionally, the adoption of public and distributed cloud, micro-services, containers and open source technologies have the potential to erode our profitability.
We face competition from, among others:
Providers of public cloud infrastructure and SaaS-based multi-cloud offerings. As businesses increasingly utilize public cloud and SaaS-based offerings, they are building more of their new compute workloads, and may also shift some of their existing workloads, off-premises. A significant percentage of new application development is happening in the public cloud, with providers such as AWS, Azure or Google Cloud, or in a distributed fashion, and these new applications are often deployed on public cloud or multi-cloud infrastructure. As a result, the demand for on-premises IT resources is expected to slow, and our products and services will need to increasingly compete for customers’ IT workloads with off-premises public cloud and SaaS-based multi-cloud offerings, such as those offered by Datadog in monitoring and IT telemetry and ServiceNow in the automation space. If we fail to address evolving customer priorities or requirements, the demand for VMware’s products and 
services may decline, and we could experience slower than expected or no growth. Additionally, VMware Cloud Provider Program (“VCPP”) offerings from our partners may compete directly with infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”) offerings from various public cloud providers, which are increasingly integrated with on-premises solutions. Although we have formed alliances with various public cloud providers to create hybrid and multi-cloud offerings, we continue to face intense competition from these public cloud providers. In fiscal 2018, we entered into a strategic alliance with AWS to deliver a vSphere-based cloud service, VMware Cloud on AWS, running in AWS data centers available in certain geographies. In fiscal 2019, we extended our collaboration with AWS to include VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts to deliver VMware Cloud on AWS as a fully managed experience to virtually any datacenter, co-location space or on-premises facility. In fiscal 2020, we also announced partnerships with Microsoft (Azure VMware Solution by CloudSimple), Google (Google Cloud VMware Engine), and Oracle (Oracle Cloud VMware Solution) under the framework of our VCPP that enable customers to run native VMware-based workloads on each of Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. Our partnerships with AWS and other public cloud providers may be seen as competitive with each other and with other VCPP partners, while some partners may elect to include solutions such as VMware Cloud on AWS as part of their managed services provider offerings. In addition, many of these public cloud providers, including AWS and Microsoft, are delivering hybrid cloud hardware solutions with integrated software, such as distributed cloud management, which may be based on specialized technologies sometimes called SmartNICs (smart network interface cards), DPUs or infrastructure processing units (“IPUs”). These specialized technologies can take on an array of compute, storage, security and networking functions, enabling greater cloud efficiency and performance gains, as well as security benefits, namely in the form of CPU hardware isolation, that may undergird hybrid cloud offerings like AWS Outposts. Public cloud infrastructure providers have also developed offerings based on servers using Arm CPUs to reduce energy costs, such as AWS Graviton, announced in 2018. To the extent customers and partners, including service providers, choose to adopt co-processor or non-x86-based models to operate native or hybrid cloud environments, demand for VMware’s on-premises, hybrid and multi-cloud products and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Providers of application modernization and open source developer platform services. Many public cloud infrastructure and multi-cloud SaaS competitors also offer standalone or embedded application development, or Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”), services. With respect to AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, PaaS services are often bundled with consumption-based IaaS offerings. These IaaS providers and other developer solution partners, such as Red Hat, a subsidiary of IBM, and HashiCorp, offer tools and services based on containers and development, security and operations (“DevSecOps”) or “shift-left” practices. These providers may offer services, such as application security testing, application performance monitoring and automation, earlier in the application lifecycle or during development, in addition to during production. While VMware offers Tanzu Observability, which directly competes in this space, competitor DevSecOps offerings may reduce the demand for or put pricing pressure on traditional VMware management and automation product offerings, which are often deployed for production use cases. Open source technologies for containerization and cloud platforms, such as Xen, KVM, Docker, rkt, OpenShift, Mesos, Kubernetes and OpenStack, and other open source software-based products, solutions and services may reduce the demand for our solutions, put pricing pressure on our offerings and enable competing vendors to leverage open source technologies to compete directly with us. New platform technologies and standards based on open source software are consistently being developed and can gain popularity quickly. Improvements in open source software could cause customers to replace software purchased from us with open source software. In step with these trends, we deliver a comprehensive container, Kubernetes and Cloud Native Application technologies portfolio with VMware Tanzu and have increased our level of commitment to open source projects and communities, such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, that are designed to increase the rate at which customers adopt micro-services architectures. The adoption of distributed micro-service application architectures, and their alignment with container technologies, represents an emerging area of competition. As we continue to invest in these areas, we will experience increasing competitive overlap with other cloud native vendors, such as Red Hat, and the large providers of public cloud infrastructure and developer services. Such competitive pressure or the availability of new open source software may cause us to experience reduced sales, increased pricing pressure, increased sales and marketing expenses and reduced operating margins, any one of which may adversely affect our operating results.
Providers of enterprise security offerings. With our acquisition of Carbon Black Inc. (“Carbon Black”) in 2019, we launched a new set of enterprise security solutions that includes the Carbon Black endpoint security platform and the intrinsic security elements of our existing NSX virtual networking, Workspace ONE end user and our compute offerings. The cybersecurity market is large, highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new solutions. Competitors in the end point security space range from established solution providers such as Microsoft and Trend Micro to next-generation endpoint security providers such as CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. While we believe that the intrinsic security elements in our existing offerings coupled with our Carbon Black endpoint security offerings and new combined offerings we expect to develop and introduce in the future will enable us to provide an integrated security offering with significant advantages over our competitors’ current offerings, our ability to gain traction and market share as a new entrant into this well-established market segment is uncertain. Additionally, new trends, such as Extended Threat Detection (“XDR”), Secure Access Service Edge (“SASE”) and Zero Trust Network Access, represent the coalescence of formerly distinct markets, such as identity management, secure web gateway, SD-WAN, network firewall and 
cloud access security brokers. These new trends may bring existing partners, such as Fortinet, Zscaler and Okta into a more competitive position with our Carbon Black, VeloCloud and other distributed network security offerings. If we are unable to successfully adapt our product and service offerings to meet these opportunities and rapidly evolving trends our operating results could be adversely affected.
Large, diversified enterprise software and hardware companies. These competitors supply a wide variety of products and services to, and have well-established relationships with, our current and prospective end users. For example, small- to medium-sized businesses and companies in emerging markets that are evaluating the adoption of virtualization-based technologies and solutions may be inclined to consider Microsoft solutions because of their existing use of Windows and Office products. Some of these competitors have in the past and may in the future take advantage of their existing relationships to engage in business practices that make our products and services less attractive or more expensive to our end users. For example, in 2019, Microsoft modified its on-premises licensing terms to require end users who wish to deploy Microsoft software on certain dedicated hosted cloud services other than Microsoft’s Azure cloud service, including VMware Cloud on AWS, to purchase additional rights from Microsoft. Other competitors have limited or denied support for their applications running in VMware virtualization environments. In addition, these competitors could integrate competitive capabilities into their existing products and services and make them available without additional charge. For example, Oracle provides free server virtualization software intended to support Oracle and non-Oracle applications, Microsoft offers its own server, network and storage virtualization software packaged with its Windows Server product as well as built-in virtualization in the client version of Windows and Cisco includes network virtualization technology in many of its data center networking platforms. As a result, existing and prospective VMware customers may elect to use products that are perceived to be “free” or “very low cost” instead of purchasing VMware products and services for certain applications where they do not believe that more advanced and robust capabilities are required.
Other industry alliances. Many of our competitors have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive virtualization and cloud computing solutions than they individually had offered. We expect these trends to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their positions in the evolving virtualization infrastructure and enterprise IT solutions industry. For example, Google Cloud is a member of the CrowdXDR Alliance, a CrowdStrike initiative competitive with VMware security offerings that also includes other VMware partners such as Zscaler. Many public cloud infrastructure providers have also entered into strategic partnerships with mobile telecommunications network providers (such as AWS with Verizon and Microsoft Azure with AT&T) to jointly embed distributed cloud infrastructure and management tools into 5G mobile networks as applications are increasingly deployed closer to end users at the “edge.” These alliances may result in more compelling product and service offerings than those we offer.
Our partners and members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. We face competition from our partners. For example, third parties currently selling our products and services could build and market their own competing products and services or market competing products and services of other vendors. Additionally, as formerly distinct sectors of enterprise IT, such as software-based virtualization and hardware-based server, networking and storage solutions, converge, we also increasingly compete with companies who are members of our developer and technology partner ecosystem. For example, in 2019, one of our important partners and customers, IBM, acquired Red Hat, one of our competitors in the cloud native applications space. In 2020, Nvidia acquired Mellanox, a SmartNIC provider, and, similarly, in 2022, AMD acquired Xilinx, an field-programmable gate array (“FPGA”) provider, and Pensando, a DPU provider, giving Nvidia and AMD the potential to offer offloaded, FAC-embedded competitive virtualization, storage, security and networking software to enterprise customers for their on-premises environments. In 2022, Intel formed a partnership with Google Cloud to develop public cloud instances using Intel IPUs, and each of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud announced agreements with Ampere, an Arm-based CPU provider. Consequently, when such convergences occur, we may find it more difficult to continue to collaborate productively on other projects with these partners, and the advantages we derive from our ecosystem could diminish.
These various forms of competition could result in increased pricing pressure and sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could also prevent our new products and services from gaining market acceptance, thereby harming our ability to increase, or causing us to lose, market share.
Intellectual Property
As of February 3, 2023, over 5,800 patents of varying duration issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have been granted or assigned to us. We also have been granted or assigned patents from other countries. These patents cover various aspects of our server virtualization and other technologies. We also have numerous pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and numerous pending international patent applications, that are specific to other aspects of our virtualization and other technologies.
We have federal trademark registrations in the U.S. for “VMWARE,” “VSPHERE,” “VCLOUD,” “VMOTION,” “HORIZON,” “AIRWATCH,” “VREALIZE,” “WORKSPACE ONE,” “ESX,” “VMWARE NSX,” “TANZU,” “VMWARE 
EXPLORE,” “CARBON BLACK,” and “PIVOTAL” and numerous other trademarks. We also have trademarks registered in several foreign countries.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand.
We enforce our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and several foreign countries. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the U.S. products covered by the claims of granted patents.
Our granted U.S. patents, and any future patents (to the extent they are issued), may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the exact effect of our patents and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
At VMware, we believe technology can have a positive impact on society and the planet. We operationalize ESG throughout our organization and believe there is an opportunity for VMware to support customers throughout their own ESG journeys. VMware’s 2030 Agenda represents our ESG strategy focused on driving sustainability, equity and trust by providing: 
•Sustainable digital infrastructure supporting the transition to net zero carbon emissions and decarbonization for our customers, supply chain and operations.
•Equitable, unbiased and inclusive access to opportunities for all by enabling people to work where and how they want to work.
•Trusted commitments to data privacy, security, ethics and transparent business practices.
Additional information about our 2030 Agenda and ESG programs can be found in VMware’s annual ESG Report on our website. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this filing on Form 10-K.
Environmental Sustainability
We are committed to creating products and services that support our customers in reducing the environmental impact of their digital infrastructure. The VMware Zero Carbon Committed program, which launched in fiscal 2022, helps VMware customers reduce the environmental impact of their digital infrastructure by connecting them with VMware Cloud Provider partners who are committed to achieving 100% renewable energy-powered data centers or carbon neutrality by 2030. 
We are also committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions for our operations and supply chain by 2030. During fiscal 2023, we continued to make progress towards validated, science-based targets, including by operating in accordance with the CarbonNeutral Protocol and the RE100’s technical guidance for procuring 100% renewable energy in our operations. Further, through our VMware Responsible Sourcing program, we helped drive sustainability, diversity and accessibility across our supply chain.
Our ESG performance was recognized by being included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the third consecutive year. Our recent environmental sustainability achievements include being named to the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”) 2022 Climate Change A-List, Corporate Knights Global 100 2023, S&P Sustainability Yearbook 2023 and receiving an EcoVadis Silver Sustainability rating. 
Human Capital
General Demographics
As of February 3, 2023, we employed approximately 38,300 employees located in 59 countries, approximately 15,000 of whom work in the U.S.
We use contractors from time to time for temporary assignments and in locations in which we do not currently have operating subsidiaries or branches. In the event that these contractor resources were not available, we do not believe that this would have a material adverse effect on our operations. We consider current employee relations to be good.
Wellbeing and Culture
The VMware culture is based on a set of shared values best expressed through the acronym EPIC2, which stands for Execution, Passion, Integrity, Customers and Community. Each year, we honor extraordinary employees through our EPIC2 Achievement Awards program. Individuals are recognized for their ability to regularly go above and beyond the Company’s 
high standards. We have quarterly EPIC2 days off and an EPIC2 shutdown at the end of the year, which enable our people to focus on their wellbeing and rejuvenate.
During fiscal 2023, we continued our programs initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to address the safety of our employees while continuing to support the business continuity needs of our customers and partners. We enabled employees to choose to work in the office or remotely, consistent with local health regulations and operational requirements. We continued to implement flexible work and customer outreach experiences that allow our teams to remain connected with each other and with our customers while maintaining and enhancing productivity, operational excellence and innovation. We continued additional benefits to employees including a wellbeing allowance, a home equipment allowance for all new employees, coverage of COVID-19 testing and treatment, as well as additional personal paid time-off days. 
Distributed Work
During fiscal 2023, we continued to invest in our dynamic, global workforce of the future, empowering our people to work from any location, consistent with business requirements, and enabling them to continue to deliver innovative solutions and operational excellence for our customers worldwide. We believe our approach to employee choice and flexibility has enabled the Company to successfully compete to hire and retain skilled and talented team members from many new locations globally and contributes to meeting our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. As our employees demonstrated throughout the pandemic, work location does not dictate success. The choice and flexibility that forms the cornerstones of our distributed workforce model mirrors the choice and flexibility we provide to our customers when choosing their digital infrastructure.
Learning and Development
At VMware, a continuous learning mindset is core to who we are as an enterprise software business. Our culture of innovation is fueled by people with a genuine curiosity for ongoing development. We offer a robust series of programs and trainings to help employees—who are already extremely skilled—engage in lifelong learning that renews and expands their potential. VMware offers many learning and development initiatives geared toward enabling specific audiences to explore the potential in themselves and others as we compete to attract and maintain talent. These include, among others, a new Leadership Development Initiative, aimed at helping Senior Directors explore executive management, as well as our Take 1 program, which supports employees with tuition reimbursement for college or a continuous learning course or conference of their choosing. We also offer our management curriculum, leadership forums and technical and sales skills development with a strong experiential learning component.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)
DEI is a business priority at VMware. Our DEI initiative, VMinclusion, is a business-led effort to attract, develop and retain the multinational, multicultural talent critical to our globally connected business. We are committed to creating a flexible, inclusive environment where everyone is respected and has equal opportunity to succeed. Specifically, we are focused on driving a culture that is inclusive of all forms of diversity: from demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status to other critical factors such as function, office location, personality, age and life experience. During fiscal 2023, we included the achievement of our company-wide DEI goals as a component of funding for all bonus-eligible employees. We continued to expand our programs and monitor the impact of our practices on the hiring and retention of talent from underrepresented communities, including women, people with disabilities, veterans and those that self-identify as being part of LGBTQ+ communities.
Our DEI achievements continue to be recognized. We were ranked second overall on the Forbes 2022 The Best Employers for Diversity, recognized by the 2022 Human Rights Campaign Foundation Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality and recognized as a 2022 DEI Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion.
As of the end of fiscal 2023, women represented 30% of our global employees and underrepresented minorities represented 13% of our U.S. employees. Underrepresented minorities at VMware includes U.S.-based persons who self-identify by race or ethnicity as African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
We are committed to equitable compensation. We know that leveraging the power of human difference starts with equal pay for equal work. We continually analyze compensation globally, accounting for multiple factors that influence pay such as job, grade, tenure, time in job, geographic location and performance. Our most recent data analysis as of September 2022 shows that at VMware, women, in the aggregate and as adjusted for the preceding listed factors, earn 99% of their male counterparts' target cash compensation globally, and underrepresented minorities earn 100% of their white counterparts in the U.S.
Compensation and Benefits
We tailor our compensation programs including base pay strategy, variable compensation programs and health, wellbeing and retirement programs to meet the needs of our employees. Equity awards are a key compensation component that enables us 
to recruit and retain top talent. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the utilization of stock-based compensation to appropriately balance competitive needs against the dilutive impact on our stockholders. These components of total compensation are part of a broader framework of employee recognition, as well as our strategy to reinforce VMware’s culture and to attract, develop and retain a talented and diverse workforce.
Trust
VMware is committed to building and protecting trust through responsible governance and transparent business practices. We focus on data privacy and security, both within our own operations and the products we provide to customers. Refer to “Products and Technology Solutions” section above for more information on VMware’s security portfolio.
Oversight and Accountability of ESG
To promote long-term stakeholder value creation and to ensure accountability, we have an ESG governance structure comprised of senior leadership, including senior functional and business leaders (the “ESG Leadership Council”), and executive sponsors, including our Chief Executive, Financial, People and Technology Officers, President and General Counsel (the “ESG Executive Sponsors”), to guide strategy, measure performance and engage with our Board of Directors on ESG matters. The Nominating, Governance and Related Persons Transactions Committee of our Board of Directors meets with our ESG Executive Sponsors at least three times per year to review ESG objectives and their integration into VMware’s strategic objectives and to maintain oversight of progress against the goals set in our 2030 Agenda. 
Reporting on ESG
As disclosure expectations and regulatory environments evolve in the jurisdictions around the world in which we operate, we continue to work to align our ESG reporting with emerging ESG disclosure and accounting standards. In fiscal 2023, we continued to be informed by concepts from the Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework as we further developed our climate change risk assessment, including potential impacts on our global operations. In addition to TCFD, VMware’s ESG self-assessments and goals are informed by ESG reporting frameworks including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”), Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) and the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. 
VMware has been recognized as a responsible company by being named for the sixth consecutive year to America’s Most Just Companies 2023 by JUST Capital, as well as being ranked in America's Most Trustworthy Companies 2022 by Newsweek.
