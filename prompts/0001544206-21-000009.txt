Item 1. Business
We are an externally managed specialty finance company whose primary focus is making directly originated loans to middle market companies. We are managed by our Investment Adviser, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Carlyle Group Inc. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Investment Company Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”). We commenced investment operations in May 2013 and closed our initial public offering in June 2017. 
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through secured debt investments in U.S. middle market companies. Our core investment strategy focuses on lending to U.S. middle market companies supported by financial sponsors, which we define as companies with approximately $25 million to $100 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow. This core strategy is supplemented with complementary specialty lending and opportunistic investing strategies, which take advantage of the broad capabilities of Carlyle's Global Credit platform while offering risk diversifying portfolio benefits. We seek to achieve our investment objective primarily through direct origination of secured debt instruments, including first lien senior secured loans (which may include stand-alone first lien loans, first lien/last out loans and “unitranche” loans) and second lien senior secured loans (collectively, “Middle Market Senior Loans”), with a minority of our assets invested in higher yielding investments (which may include unsecured debt, mezzanine debt and investments in equities).
We invest primarily in loans to middle market companies whose debt, if rated, is rated below investment grade, and, if not rated, would likely be rated below investment grade if it were rated (that is, below BBB- or Baa3, which is often referred to as “junk”). Exposure to below investment grade instruments involves certain risks, including speculation with respect to the borrower’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. See Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—Our investments are risky and speculative”.

We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees.
In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Carlyle, including our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. 
Formation Transactions and Corporate Structure
We were formed in February 2012 as a Maryland corporation structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end investment company. On May 2, 2013, we elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and commenced substantial investment operations upon the completion of our initial closing of equity capital commitments. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013.
Effective on March 15, 2017, we changed our name from “Carlyle GMS Finance, Inc.” to “TCG BDC, Inc.” On June 19, 2017, we closed our initial public offering, issuing 9,454,200 shares of our common stock (including shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option on July 5, 2017) at a public offering price of $18.50 per share. Shares of common stock of TCG BDC began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CGBD” on June 14, 2017.
Our Investment Adviser
Our investment activities are managed by our Investment Adviser. The principal executive offices of our Investment Adviser are located at One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, NY 10017, with additional offices in Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. Our Investment Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing and structuring investments and monitoring investments on an ongoing basis.
Our Investment Adviser is served by origination, capital markets, underwriting and portfolio management teams comprised of experienced investment professionals across Carlyle's Global Credit segment, as defined below. Our investment approach is focused on long-term credit performance and principal preservation. Our Investment Adviser’s investment team utilizes a rigorous, systematic, and consistent investment process, refined over Carlyle’s 33-year history investing in private markets across multiple cycles, designed to achieve enhanced risk-adjusted returns.
Our Investment Adviser’s five-person investment committee is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The members of the investment committee have experience investing through different credit cycles. The investment committee is led by Mark Jenkins, a Managing Director and Head of Global Credit at Carlyle.
Our Investment Adviser also serves, and may serve in the future, as investment adviser to other existing and future affiliated BDCs that have investment objectives similar to our investment objectives.
Our Investment Adviser entered into a personnel agreement with The Carlyle Group Employee Co., L.L.C. (“Carlyle Employee Co.”), an affiliate of our Investment Adviser, pursuant to which Carlyle Employee Co. provides our Investment Adviser with access to investment professionals that comprise our Investment Adviser’s investment team. As of December 31, 2020, our Investment Adviser’s investment team included a team of more than 170 investment professionals across the Global Credit segment. Our Investment Adviser’s investment committee comprises five of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across asset classes and over 26 years of average industry experience and 10 years of average tenure. In addition, our Investment Adviser and its investment team are supported by a team of finance, operations and administrative professionals currently employed by Carlyle Employee Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Carlyle.
Our Investment Adviser, its investment professionals, our executive officers and directors, and other current and future principals of our Investment Adviser serve or may serve as investment advisers, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements advised by Carlyle. An affiliated investment fund, account or other similar arrangement currently formed or formed in the future and managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, our Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may face conflicts of interest arising out of the investment advisory activities of our

Investment Adviser and other operations of Carlyle. See “—Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by our Investment Adviser, which could impact our investment returns” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
Our Administrator
CGCA, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as our Administrator. Pursuant to an administration agreement between us and the Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), our Administrator provides services to us and we reimburse our Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by our Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the compensation of certain of our officers and staff. In addition, our Administrator has entered into a sub-administration agreement with Carlyle Employee Co. (the “Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement”), which provides our Administrator with access to personnel. Our Administrator has also entered into a sub-administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street” and such agreement, the “State Street Sub-Administration Agreement” and, together with the Carlyle Sub-Administration Agreement, the “Sub-Administration Agreements”), pursuant to which State Street provides for certain administrative and professional services. State Street also serves as our custodian.
Carlyle
Our Investment Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of Carlyle. Carlyle is a global investment firm with deep industry expertise that deploys private capital across three business segments: Global Private Equity, Global Credit and Investment Solutions. With $246 billion of assets under management (“AUM”) as of December 31, 2020, Carlyle’s purpose is to invest wisely and create value on behalf of its investors, portfolio companies and the communities in which we live and invest. Carlyle employs 1,825 employees, including 678 investment professionals in 29 offices across five continents, and serves more than 2,650 active carry fund investors from 95 countries.
Carlyle’s Global Credit segment, which currently has $55.9 billion in assets under management, advises a group of 71 active funds that pursue investment strategies across the credit spectrum, including liquid credit, illiquid credit, and real assets credit. Since the establishment of Global Credit in 1999, these various capital sources provide the opportunity for Carlyle to offer highly customizable and creative financing solutions to borrowers to meet their specific capital needs. In 2020, Carlyle hired several new senior investment professionals to continue to build Global Credit’s investment breadth and geographical presence.
Primary areas of focus for Carlyle’s Global Credit segment include: 
Liquid Credit
•Loans and Structured Credit. The structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through CLOs and other investment vehicles. In 2020, Carlyle closed three new U.S. CLOs and one CLO in Europe with a total of $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, of AUM at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Carlyle’s loans and structured credit team advised 52 structured credit funds and two carry funds in the United States, Europe, and Asia totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $29.4 billion in AUM.
Illiquid Credit
•Direct Lending. Carlyle’s direct lending business includes Carlyle’s BDCs, which invest primarily in first lien loans (which include unitranche, “first out” and “last out” loans) and second lien loans of middle market companies, typically defined as companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $25 million to $100 million, that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond markets. In 2020, Carlyle expanded its direct lending capabilities by adding senior personnel to bolster its underwriting capabilities. As of December 31, 2020, Carlyle’s direct lending investment team advised two BDCs (including the Company) and five separately managed accounts, totaling, in the aggregate, $5.0 billion in AUM.
•Opportunistic Credit. Carlyle’s opportunistic credit team invests primarily in highly-structured and privately-negotiated capital solutions supporting corporate borrowers through secured loans, senior subordinated debt, mezzanine debt, convertible notes, and other debt like instruments, as well as preferred and common equity in such borrowers. The team will also look to invest in special situations (i.e., event-driven opportunities that exhibit hybrid credit and equity features) as well as market dislocations (i.e., primary and secondary market investments in liquid debt instruments that arise as a result of temporary market volatility). As of December 31, 2020, 
5


Carlyle’s opportunistic credit team advised two funds and one separately managed account totaling, in the aggregate, $5.0 billion in AUM.
•Distressed Credit. The distressed credit funds generally invest in liquid and illiquid securities and obligations, including secured debt, senior and subordinated unsecured debt, convertible debt obligations, preferred stock and public and private equity of financially distressed companies in defensive and asset-rich industries. In certain investments, these funds may seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into controlling positions in the equity of the reorganized companies. As of December 31, 2020, Carlyle’s distressed credit team advised three funds totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $3.2 billion in AUM.
Real Assets Credit
•Aircraft Financing and Servicing. Carlyle Aviation Partners, Ltd. (“Carlyle Aviation Partners”) is Carlyle's multi-strategy investment platform that is engaged in commercial aviation aircraft financing and investment throughout commercial aviation industry. As of December 31, 2020, Carlyle Aviation Partners had approximately $6.1 billion in AUM across four active carry funds, in addition to securitization vehicles and liquid strategies.
•Infrastructure Debt. Our Infrastructure debt team invests primarily in directly originated and privately negotiated debt instruments related to global infrastructure projects, primarily in the power, energy, transportation, water/waste, telecommunications and social infrastructure sectors. The team focuses primarily on senior, subordinated, and mezzanine debt and seeks to invest primarily in developed markets within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). As of December 31, 2020, our infrastructure debt team managed $1.1 billion in AUM.
Other Credit
•Insurance Solutions. Carlyle Insurance Solutions (“CIS”) combines our deep insurance expertise with portfolio construction capabilities, capital sourcing and asset origination strengths to provide comprehensive liability funding/reinsurance, asset management and advisory solutions for (re)insurance companies and fund investors. The CIS team oversees the investment in Fortitude Holdings. As of December 31, 2020, AUM related to capital raised from third-party investors to acquire a controlling interest in Fortitude Holdings was $2.6 billion, and Fortitude and AIG have committed approximately $4.7 billion of capital to-date to various Carlyle strategies.
•Global Capital Markets. Carlyle Global Capital Markets (“GCM”) is a loan syndication and capital markets business that launched in 2018. The primary focus of GCM is to arrange, place, underwrite, originate and syndicate loans and underwrite securities of third parties and Carlyle portfolio companies through TCG Capital Markets L.L.C. and TCG Senior Funding L.L.C. TCG Capital Markets is a FINRA registered broker dealer. GCM may also act as the initial purchaser of such loans and securities. GCM receives fees, including underwriting, placement, structuring, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting and original issue discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities and/or loans, in respect of the activities described above and may elect to waive such fees.
Strategic Relationships
We have established, and may in the future establish, strategic relationships that may diversify our product offering, increase our scale, enhance our origination capabilities or provide other benefits. To this end, in early 2016, we and Credit Partners USA LLC (“Credit Partners”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PSP Investments Holding USA LLC, an affiliate of a large Canadian pension fund, agreed to co-invest through Credit Fund, a joint venture primarily focused on investing in first lien loans to middle market companies. Since its inception and through December 31, 2020, Credit Fund has invested in over $2.6 billion (before any repayments or exits) of senior secured loans. We and Credit Partners each have 50% economic ownership of Credit Fund and have commitments to fund, from time to time, capital of up to $250 million each. Additionally, in November 2020 we and Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund ("CCLF"), an investment vehicle managed by Cliffwater LLC, agreed to co-invest through Middle Market Credit Fund II, LLC ("Credit Fund II"), a joint venture primarily focused on investing in senior secured loans of middle market companies. The initial portfolio of Credit Fund II was comprised predominantly of senior secured loans contributed by TCG BDC. We and CCLF have 84.13% and 15.87% ownership in Credit Fund II, respectively. 
Competitive Strengths
Carlyle Global Credit’s key competitive strengths are based on Carlyle’s integrated platform, which allows it to mitigate competition and thereby improve our ability to deliver on the expectations of shareholders. The following characteristics distinguish Carlyle’s capabilities: 
6


Market Leading Direct Origination Platform. We have access to Carlyle Global Credit’s large direct origination platform, including a dedicated financial sponsor coverage team and the sourcing capabilities of other investment professionals on the platform who regularly generate attractive investment opportunities for the Company. Through these integrated efforts the origination team generates, and expects to continue to generate, a significant amount of differentiated, directly originated deal flow from which to select attractive investment opportunities.
Broad Product Capabilities. Carlyle Global Credit offers a broad range of leveraged finance products to the marketplace, which allows us to invest across the entire capital structure, as well as via specialty products such as asset-based and recurring revenue technology loans. These integrated and differentiated capabilities make our investment highly relevant to borrowers, as Carlyle Global Credit can construct comprehensive, tailored financing solutions. By doing so, Carlyle Global Credit is able to more frequently assert greater control over structure, price and terms of investments, which we can leverage in seeking to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. 
Scaled Capital Base. With $55.9 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2020, we believe Carlyle Global Credit’s hold sizes are among the largest in the market. Carlyle Global Credit's ability to deploy comparatively larger amounts of capital delivers certainty of execution for borrowers and mitigates the threat of competition, resulting in the ability to drive terms and generate attractive investment opportunities. In addition, scaled capital deployment allows Carlyle Global Credit to establish leadership positions in financing transactions, which results in improved informational access and incremental influence and control in debt financings. 
Depth of Expertise. We benefit from our Investment Adviser’s utilization of the broader resources of Carlyle, which includes access to Carlyle’s relationships and institutional knowledge from over three decades of private market investing. Our Investment Adviser's dedicated, sector aligned underwriting teams have significant experience and tenure. These teams leverage Carlyle’s broader resources – nearly 680 investment professionals, more than 50 operating executives, information obtained through direct ownership of 256 companies, lending relationships with over 700 companies, and in-house government affairs, ESG and economic research teams – to generate differentiated diligence insights and inform fundamental credit selection. We believe our ability to draw on the experience and knowledge of these broader capabilities gives us a significant advantage during the underwriting process. As a firm, Carlyle seeks to bring the collective power of the global platform with respect to individual investments. We believe this integrated and collaborative approach allows us to move faster, and with higher conviction, than many of our competitors. 
Rigorous Investment Process Conducted by Experienced Investment Team. Carlyle employs a robust, iterative and heavily documented underwriting process. Our Investment Adviser’s investment team comprises investment professionals who have extensive middle market lending experience. As of December 31, 2020, the investment team included a team of more than 170 investment professionals across the Global Credit segment. Our Investment Adviser’s investment committee comprises five of the most senior credit professionals within the Global Credit segment, with backgrounds and expertise across asset classes and over 26 years of average industry experience and 10 years of average tenure. We believe the breadth and depth of the investment team's experience in sourcing, structuring, executing, and monitoring a broad range of investments provides us with a significant competitive advantage in building a high quality portfolio of investments.
Defensive Investment Approach. Our portfolio has been defensively constructed, and is highly diversified by borrower, industry sector, sponsor relationships and other metrics. As of December 31, 2020, we had a portfolio of 160 investments in 117 portfolio companies across 27 industries and 63 unique sponsors. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 99.1% of our debt investments bore interest at floating rates, primarily subject to interest rate floors, and 67.0% of our portfolio was invested in first lien debt investments (including 3.4% first lien/last out loans). 
Market Opportunity
We believe the middle market lending environment provides attractive investment opportunities as a result of a combination of the following factors:
Favorable Market Environment. We believe the middle market remains one of the most attractive investment areas due to its large size, superior value relative to the broadly syndicated loan market, and supply-demand imbalance that continues to favor non-bank lenders. We believe market yields remain attractive and leverage levels at middle market companies are stable, creating a favorable investment environment.
Large and Growing U.S. Middle Market. The U.S. middle market is the largest market by many measures, which is expected to enable us to invest selectively as approximately 70% of middle market loan volume is sponsor-backed. According to S&P Capital IQ, as of December 31, 2020, there are over 77,000 U.S. middle market companies generating between $20 
7


million and $1 billion in annual revenue, compared with approximately 4,000 companies with revenue greater than $1 billion. We believe these middle market companies, both sponsored and non-sponsored, represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow.
Benefits of Traditional Middle Market Focus – Leverage, Pricing and Risk. According to the S&P Global Market Intelligence LCD Quarterly Leveraged Lending Review (Q4 2020) and Fitch U.S. Leveraged Loan Default Insight (January 28, 2021), middle market companies, which we define as borrowers with EBITDA of approximately $25 million and $100 million, are generally less levered, have larger equity contributions, and experience lower rates of default versus large cap broadly syndicated loans, which we define as loans to borrowers with greater than $100 million of EBITDA. Middle market loans relative to broadly syndicated loans also tend to achieve more attractive economics in the form of upfront fees, spreads, and prepayment penalties, and benefit from stronger defensive structures through terms including, but not limited to documentation, asset security, priority in payments, covenants, and information/governance, all of which potentially provide more favorable protection against credit deterioration. Middle market lenders like us are also often able to complete more thorough due diligence investigations prior to investment than lenders in the broadly syndicated space. We believe the confluence of these factors have resulted in, over the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, middle market loans driving an approximate 150 to 200 basis points spread premium over broadly syndicated loans according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence LCD Leveraged Loan Index, without taking incremental credit risk as evidenced by lower default rates and higher recovery rates as compared to broadly syndicated loans.
Market Environment Favors Non-Traditional Lenders. Traditional middle market lenders, such as commercial and regional banks and commercial finance companies, have contracted their origination and lending activities and are focusing on more liquid asset classes or have exited the business. At the same time, institutional investors have sought to invest in larger, more liquid offerings, limiting the ability of middle market companies to raise debt capital through public capital markets. This has resulted in other capital providers, such as specialty finance companies, structured-credit vehicles such as CLOs, BDCs, and private investment funds, actively investing in the middle market. We believe the aforementioned changes and restrictions have created a large and growing market opportunity for alternative lenders such as us.
Favorable Capital Markets Trends. Current and future demand for middle market financings, driven by private equity investment and upcoming maturities are expected to provide us with ample deal flow. Current data from the Refinitiv suggests that approximately $553 billion of upcoming loan maturities for middle market companies are due between 2021 and 2027, and the Preqin PE North American Report suggests that there is approximately $865 billion of uninvested private equity capital as of December 31, 2020. We believe these refinancings and uninvested capital will provide a steady flow of attractive opportunities for well-positioned lenders with deep and longstanding sponsor and market relationships, particularly for providers of full capital structure financing solutions.
Investment Strategy
We primarily target loans to U.S.-based middle market companies that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, and refinancings, with a focus on companies controlled by private equity investment firms. In addition, we may also make investments in non-private equity owned public or private companies of various sizes; as well as invest in certain non-U.S.-based borrowers. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term, value-maximizing strategies. Target investments typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics:
•Borrowers with EBITDA of $25—$100 million;
•Leading market positions;
•Defensible business strategies with significant barriers to entry;
•Diversified product offerings, customer bases and supplier profiles;
•Experienced management teams with successful track records;
•Significant valuation cushion, typically expressed as a significant equity investment from a financial sponsor;
•Demonstrated stability and/or growth of revenue;
•Predictable cash flows with limited risks of disruption; 
•Low capital expenditures requirements; and
•A North American base of operations.
8


While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be necessarily met by each prospective portfolio company. In addition, we may change our investment objective and/or investment criteria over time without notice to or consent from our investors.
Investment Criteria and Transactional Structures 
We invest primarily in transactions supported by private equity sponsors. We seek to invest in the following types of assets, with an emphasis on senior debt:
•traditional cash flow senior secured debt;
•unitranche senior secured debt financings;
•“last out” unitranche debt;
•second lien senior debt;
•traditional subordinated debt;
•preferred and common equity co-investments; and
•secondary and other opportunistic asset purchases.
As noted above, we may also from time to time participate in traditional subordinated debt financings, preferred and common equity co-investments. We may also make secondary purchases of all of the above types of investments and other securities on an opportunistic basis.
Investment Approach and Risk Monitoring of Investments
Our Investment Adviser utilizes a robust, iterative, and heavily documented due diligence underwriting process to evaluate all investment opportunities. Our Investment Adviser’s investment teams primarily consist of origination professionals, underwriters and portfolio management professionals. An investment team works on a particular transaction from initial screening through closing, and the same team continues to monitor the credit for the life cycle of the investment.
We view our investment process as consisting of the phases described below:
Origination. Our Investment Adviser has built a strong direct origination platform. Our Investment Adviser’s origination team sources approximately 1,400 opportunities per year with an ultimate investment rate by us of less than 5% annually. The scale of our Investment Adviser’s origination platform allows us to maximize access to investment opportunities, enhance overall investment selectivity and diversify risks in our portfolio. We further seek to reduce risk by partnering with experienced sponsors with strong track records. We believe lending to companies owned by leading private equity firms (versus non-sponsored companies) has several important and potentially defensive characteristics. 
Carlyle's financial sponsor origination team covers over 200 private equity firms, financial institutions, other middle market lenders, strategic relationships and arrangements, financial advisors, and experienced management teams, generally organized on a regional basis with offices in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. It is their responsibility to source specific opportunities, identify potential loan candidates, and apply creative and flexible solutions to solve clients’ financing needs. Each originator maintains long-standing relationships with potential sources of deal flow and is responsible for covering a specified target market. We believe those originators’ strength and breadth of relationships, combined with our platform's capabilities, allow us to source investments across a wide range of markets enabling our Investment Adviser to be highly selective in recommending investments.
Transaction Screening. After the originator and a senior investment team member have completed an initial screen, the investment team will prepare and present a screening memo that includes, but is not limited to, a business description, proposed transaction financing structures, preliminary financial analysis (including a cash flow forecast incorporating downside scenarios), debt and equity comparables, and the team's initial assessment of investment merits and key risks and market/industry considerations to a screening committee of senior members of the Direct Lending team (the "Screening Committee"). Based on feedback from the Screening Committee, the deal team will prepare and disseminate an outcome email that documents the takeaways from the meeting, including preferred financing structure as well as terms, key diligence items, and next steps.
Underwriting. Following an indication from the Screening Committee to move forward in the diligence process, the investment team will compile a detailed diligence list and prepare for in-depth credit analysis. During the investment process, the investment team works closely with the private equity sponsor / borrower in all aspects of due diligence. Formal due diligence includes meeting the management team, reviewing the data room and performing key financial analysis, creating a more 
9


detailed financial model with sensitivities across various market environments, reviewing sell-side and third party research including industry reports and financial diligence, following up with industry experts within the Carlyle network for additional feedback and drafting the commitment papers and term sheet. As part of the extensive due diligence process, the investment team fully leverages all internal Carlyle resources to aid in investment decisions. This includes, as needed, speaking to Carlyle Private Equity investment professionals (in accordance with information barrier restrictions), Carlyle operating executives, Carlyle’s Chief Economist & Director of Research, Carlyle’s government affairs professionals, and any executive within Carlyle’s private equity portfolio, which includes over 250 companies worldwide. In addition, the investment team may utilize third party expert networks to supplement its work to gain further insight into company and industry factors from various thought leaders across the company’s markets. Carlyle recently enhanced its due diligence process by incorporating formal ESG reviews. While ESG has always been a component of the screening process, all deals will now be thoroughly vetted using sector and sub-sector specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards. ESG diligence will further incorporate country risk assessments for corruption and anti-money laundering concerns as well. This part of the process is iterative and involves re-screening with members of the Investment Adviser's investment committee before seeking final investment committee approval. Over the course of the underwriting process, the investment team crafts a fulsome memo, with diligence completed on a variety of industry, company-specific, financial and legal topics that includes, but is not limited to, the following:
•Overview of the opportunity, investment team recommendation, and risks and mitigants
•Structure, terms and pricing of the proposed facilities
•Sources and uses and capitalization table
•Industry growth (including total addressable market, penetration and whitespace), key industry trends, risk of disruption (with focus on technological disruption), competitive landscape and side-by-side analysis of key competitors, borrower's market position and reputation, industry fragmentation and consolidation trends, M&A trends and valuation multiples, barriers to entry for new adjacent or substitute players and regulatory framework
•Details on core product and service offering, including revenue visibility and quality, revenue and gross profit build-up by key products / services (including price and volume trends, if applicable), concentration and margins, and other relevant sector-specific metrics
•Customer diligence, including concentration, wallet share, tenure, health of customer base, contract details (if applicable), and sales and marketing team and related strategy
•Contracts, including maturity and termination, renewal waterfalls, ability to pass through costs, exclusivity
•Supply chain diligence, including supplier concentration, raw material exposure, pricing power and logistics
•Details on operations, including IT and technology, operating footprint (including real estate and leases, if applicable), distribution, and employee base
•Financial diligence, including cyclicality, seasonality, fixed and variable costs, EBITDA adjustments, capital expenditures, working capital (including aging and write-offs), detailed, bottom up cash flow modeling with sensitivities for key business risks, tax characteristics and tax shield, accounting policies (including revenue and cost recognition), bonding requirements, foreign exchange exposure, and earn-outs and off-balance sheet liabilities
•Financial model, including detailed, bottom-up cash flow model with sensitivities for key business risks 
•Debt and equity comparables
•Details on management team, including quality, depth and reputation, and private equity sponsor (if applicable)
•Details on legal documentation, including construction of EBITDA and indebtedness, financial covenants and equity cures, affirmative covenants (including reporting requirements, audits, budgets, and maintaining good standing), permitted indebtedness, permitted liens and incremental facilities (including most favored nation protection), restricted payments and tax distributions, permitted acquisitions and investments, permitted divestitures and mandatory prepayments, events of default and cure periods, enforcement of remedies, security and collateral package, assignability of key contracts, leases, material IP or other key collateral, limitations on fundamental changes and transferring collateral, voting and assignment provisions, and other key terms
•Environmental, regulatory, or legal issues and insurance coverage
•Adherence with environmental, social and governance policies
•Items as to which approval is conditional and which require further due diligence and/or subsequent resolution
Monitoring. We view proactive portfolio monitoring as a vital part of the investment process, which includes the continuous review by the portfolio management, underwriting and workout teams, with multiple layers of risk review and oversight. Our Investment Adviser utilizes a proprietary credit surveillance dashboard, an Internal Risk Rating system and proprietary 
10


valuation model to assess risk in the portfolio. The portfolio management process involves a variety of ongoing and scheduled reviews that allow for early detection of issues and escalation to the Investment Committee and workout team to avoid credit losses. This process includes detailed portfolio dashboard updates, monthly reviews of watch list credits, quarterly meetings to conduct formal portfolio reviews, focused on technical analysis of financial performance, and portfolio diversification, and ongoing ad-hoc meetings to handle borrower-specific requests, including follow-on transactions and amendments. Our Investment Adviser supplements these processes with additional analyses and projections, including stress scenarios, to assess the potential exposure of our portfolio to variable macroeconomic factors and market conditions. For more information on the Internal Risk Ratings of our portfolio, see Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity.”

See the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 in our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on these investments, including a list of companies and type, cost and fair value of investments.
Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
An affiliated investment fund, account or other similar arrangement currently formed or formed in the future and managed by our Investment Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives and strategies with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. This creates potential conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other investment funds, accounts and similar arrangements, particularly in circumstances where the availability or liquidity of such investment opportunities is limited or where co-investments by us and other funds, accounts or arrangements are not permitted under applicable law, as discussed below.
For example, Carlyle sponsors several investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, including, without limitation, structured credit funds, closed-end registered investment companies, BDCs, carry funds, and managed accounts and structured credit funds it may sponsor in the future. The SEC has granted us exemptive relief that permits us and certain of our affiliates to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments (the “Exemptive Relief”). If Carlyle is presented with investment opportunities that generally fall within our investment objective and other board-established criteria and those of other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements (including other existing and future affiliated BDCs) whether focused on a debt strategy or otherwise, Carlyle allocates such opportunities among us and such other Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar 
12


arrangements in a manner consistent with the Exemptive Relief, our Investment Adviser’s allocation policies and procedures and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures, where applicable, as discussed below. More specifically, investment opportunities in suitable negotiated investments for investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements managed by our Investment Adviser, and other funds, accounts or similar arrangements managed by affiliated investment advisers that seek to co-invest with us or other Carlyle BDCs, are allocated in accordance with the Exemptive Relief. Investment opportunities for all other investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements not managed by our Investment Adviser are allocated in accordance with their respective investment advisers’ and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures may result in certain investment opportunities that are attractive to us being allocated to other funds that are not managed by our Investment Adviser. Carlyle’s, including our Investment Adviser’s, allocation policies and procedures are designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among its clients over time, taking into account a variety of factors which may include the sourcing of the transaction, the nature of the investment focus of each such other Carlyle fund, accounts or other similar arrangements, each fund’s, account’s or similar arrangement’s desired level of investment, the relative amounts of capital available for investment, the nature and extent of involvement in the transaction on the part of the respective teams of investment professionals, any requirements contained in the limited partnership agreements and other governing agreements of the Carlyle funds, accounts or other similar arrangements and other considerations deemed relevant by Carlyle in good faith, including suitability considerations and reputational matters. The application of these considerations may cause differences in the performance of different Carlyle funds, accounts and similar arrangements that have similar strategies.
Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle.
We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with clients of our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser’s and Carlyle’s other allocation policies and procedures.
While Carlyle and our Investment Adviser seek to implement their respective allocation processes in a fair and equitable manner under the particular circumstances, there can be no assurance that it will result in equivalent allocation of or participation in investment opportunities or equivalent performance of investments allocated to us as compared to the other entities. In some cases, due to information barriers that are in place, we and other Carlyle investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements may compete with each other for specific investment opportunities without being aware that they are competing with each other. Carlyle has a conflict system in place above these information barriers to identify potential conflicts early in the process and determine if an allocation decision needs to be made or if an investment is precluded. If the conflicts system detects a potential conflict, the legal and compliance departments of Carlyle assess investment opportunities to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is required to be allocated to a particular investment fund, account or other similar arrangement (including us) or is prohibited from being allocated to a particular investment fund, account or similar arrangement. Subject to a determination by the legal and compliance departments (if applicable), portfolio management teams and, as applicable, the Investment Adviser's allocation committees, are then charged with ensuring that investment opportunities are allocated to the appropriate investment fund, account or similar arrangement in accordance with our Investment Adviser's allocation policies and procedures. In addition, in some cases Carlyle and our Investment Adviser may make investment recommendations to investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements where the investment funds, accounts and other similar arrangements make the investment independently of Carlyle and our Investment Adviser. As a result, there are circumstances where investments appropriate for us are instead allocated, in whole or in part, to such other investment funds, accounts or other similar arrangements irrespective of our Investment Adviser’s and Carlyle’s other policies and procedures regarding allocation of investments. Where Carlyle otherwise has discretion to allocate investment opportunities among various funds, accounts and other similar arrangements, it should be noted that Carlyle may determine to allocate such investment opportunities away from us.
During periods of unusual market conditions, our Investment Adviser may deviate from its normal trade allocation practices. For example, this may occur with respect to the management of unlevered and/or long-only investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements that are typically managed on a side-by-side basis with levered and/or long-short investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements.
For potential conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities among the Company and other investment funds, accounts or similar arrangements advised by Carlyle, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related 
13


to Our Business and Structure—There are significant potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by our Investment Adviser, which could impact our investment returns.”
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. Instead, dividends we distribute generally will be taxable to the holders of our common stock, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes may not pass through to the holders of our common stock. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (generally, our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction) for any taxable year (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). The following discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we (1) qualify as a RIC, and (2) satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our net taxable income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
In addition, if we fail to distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year (the “Excise Tax Distribution Requirements”), we are liable for a 4% excise tax on the portion of the undistributed amounts of such income that are less than the amounts required to be distributed based on the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year is considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). 
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

•continue to qualify as a BDC under the Investment Company Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or foreign currencies (the “90% Gross Income Test”); and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, or two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirements, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to raise additional debt or equity capital or sell assets to make distributions, we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, and therefore would not be able to maintain our qualification as a RIC. Additionally, we may make investments that result in the recognition of ordinary income rather than capital gain, or that prevent us from accruing a long-term holding period. These investments may prevent us from making capital gain distributions as described below. We intend to monitor our transactions, make the appropriate tax elections and make the appropriate entries in our books and records when we make any such investments in order to mitigate the effect of these rules.
14


A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income, we would have a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a holder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than the holder would have received in the absence of such transactions.
Regulation
General—Regulation as a Business Development Company
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act and have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders with the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act (such directors are referred to as the “Independent Directors” and the directors who are not Independent Directors are referred to as the “Interested Directors”). We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to certain transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and certain affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. Because we are a BDC, we are not generally permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Carlyle or other funds managed by Carlyle. We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with our Investment Adviser or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Carlyle) without complying with our Exemptive Relief, subject to certain exceptions, including with respect to our downstream affiliates. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction. We may also co-invest with funds managed by Carlyle or any of its downstream affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, existing regulatory guidance, and our Investment Adviser’s allocation policies and procedures.
As a BDC, we are generally required to meet a minimum “asset coverage” ratio after each issuance of senior securities. “Asset coverage” generally refers to a company’s total assets, less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by “senior securities,” as defined in the Investment Company Act, divided by total senior securities representing indebtedness and, if applicable, preferred stock. “Senior securities” for this purpose includes borrowings from banks or other lenders, debt securities and preferred stock. On April 9, 2018 and June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act), and our stockholders, respectively, approved the application to us of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to us was reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of June 7, 2018, the first day after our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
15


We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies. We may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and currency fluctuations. We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants or options to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financings or other investments. In connection with such an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company (unless certain conditions are satisfied), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intended status to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” for more information.
In addition, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the Investment Company Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions.
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value ("NAV") per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV of our common stock if our Independent Directors determine that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Independent Directors, closely approximates the market value of such shares (less any distributing commission or discount). In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below NAV in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. Pursuant to approval granted at a special meeting of stockholders held on October 28, 2020, we are authorized, with the approval of the Board of Directors, to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then-current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations (including that the number of shares issued does not exceed 25% of our then-outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering). Such stockholder approval expires on October 28, 2021. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage” and “—The NAV per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock.”
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.”
Qualifying Assets
As a BDC, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies and certain public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in non-qualifying assets, as permitted by the Investment Company Act. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may invest in entities that are not considered “eligible portfolio companies” (as defined in the Investment Company Act), including companies located outside of the United States, entities that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions under the Investment Company Act, and publicly traded entities whose public equity market capitalization exceeds the levels provided for under the Investment Company Act.
16


Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
    As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Investment Adviser may provide all or a portion of this assistance pursuant to our administration agreement, the costs of which will be reimbursed by us. We may receive fees for these services.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as “temporary investments,” so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may also invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Indebtedness and Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factor—Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.”
Codes of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and our Investment Adviser has adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively (collectively, the “Rule 17j-1 Codes of Ethics”), which establish procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions and apply to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Rule 17j-1Codes of Ethics generally do not permit investments by personnel subject to them in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. The Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics are filed with the SEC (www.sec.gov).
We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOX Code of Ethics”), which applies to, among others, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The SOX Code of Ethics is available free of charge on our website (http://www.tcgbdc.com).
 There have been no material changes to the Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics or the SOX Code of Ethics or material waivers of the code that apply to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and our Investment Adviser have each adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory 
17


requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
•pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to material weaknesses.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. These guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our Independent Directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, our Investment Adviser recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Our Investment Adviser will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. Our Investment Adviser will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although our Investment Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Our Investment Adviser’s proxy voting decisions will be made by its investment committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Investment Adviser will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Investment Adviser’s investment committee, and Independent Directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Investment Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: TCG BDC, Inc., c/o Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C., One Vanderbilt Avenue, Suite 3400, New York, NY 10017.
Privacy Principles
We endeavor to maintain the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguard their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help stockholders understand what non-public personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share that information with select other parties.
18


We may collect non-public personal information about stockholders from our subscription agreements or other forms, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the non-public personal information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, to our affiliates and service providers and as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information from us is permitted to use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. We permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that non-public personal information to provide services to us and our stockholders. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards for non-public personal information that are designed to comply with applicable law.
Compliance with Listing Requirements
Our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CGBD” on June 14, 2017. As a listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we are subject to various listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We monitor our compliance with all listing standards and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Reporting Obligations and Available Information
We furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as well as reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding directors, officers or 10% beneficial owners of us, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge on our website (http://www.tcgbdc.com).
The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including us, which can be accessed at www.sec.gov.
Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, collateralized loan obligations, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act and the Code impose on us. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we will face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
We expect to use the expertise of the members of our Investment Adviser’s investment committee and its investment team to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments. In addition, we expect that extensive direct origination resources, broad product capabilities, ability to commit capital in scale and the depth of expertise of our Investment Adviser’s investment team will enable us to learn about and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and compete with investment vehicles sponsored or advised by our affiliates”.
