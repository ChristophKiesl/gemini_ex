Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies, including Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg, a treatment to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra 2016 net revenue was $492.8 million, an increase of approximately 13% over 2015. We also market Zanaflex Capsules and tablets, FDA-approved as short-acting drugs for the management of spasticity, and Qutenza, an FDA-approved dermal patch for the management of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, also known as post-shingles pain.
 We have five Orange Book-listed patents providing protection for Ampyra up to 2027. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers, and also inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). An adverse outcome in either of these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange Book-listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 We have a pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, migraine and MS. CVT-301 is our most advanced clinical program and our highest priority. CVT-301 is a self-administered inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, using our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease. On February 9, 2017, we announced efficacy and safety clinical data from a Phase 3 clinical trial that we completed in 2016. The data shows a statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. The safety profile of CVT-301 in the trial was consistent with that observed in a prior Phase 2b clinical trial. We plan to file a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the FDA in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter of 2017, pending data from ongoing long-term safety studies. We also plan to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe by the end of 2017 pending additional data analyses. We project that, if approved, CVT-301 could generate peak annual U.S. net revenue of more than $500 million. 
 In 2016, we acquired Biotie Therapies Corp., and pursuant to the acquisition we acquired worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time. Further expanding our pipeline, we also obtained global rights to SYN120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A dual receptor antagonist in Phase 2 development with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s-related dementia. We believe these acquired Biotie clinical stage programs, together with our CVT-301 clinical development program, position Acorda as a leader in Parkinson’s disease therapeutic development.
 Concurrently with the announcement of the Biotie transaction, we announced two separate financing transactions. The first was a private placement of 2,250,900 shares of our common stock in January 2016 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $75 million. We used the net proceeds from the private placement to fund, in part, the acquisition of Biotie described above. We also announced a commitment from JPMorgan Chase, N.A. for an asset-based credit facility for up to $60 million, which we entered into on June 1, 2016. Availability under the facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on our and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries' eligible accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, after adjusting for customary factors that are subject to modification from time to time by the administrative agent under the facility at its discretion (not to be exercised unreasonably). Based on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and other components of the borrowing base, the availability under the facility was approximately $60 million as of December 31, 2016.
 Our strategy is to continue growing as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, focusing primarily in the areas of Parkinson’s disease, migraine and MS. Our priorities for 2017 include advancing our late stage Parkinson’s disease development programs, continuing to grow Ampyra and defending our Ampyra patents, and pursing partnering or out-licensing transactions for some of our earlier-stage programs.

Company Highlights
 Ampyra
 Ampyra is the first product for which we completed clinical development. Ampyra, an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), was approved by the FDA in January 2010. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product indicated to improve walking in people with MS. Ampyra was made commercially available in the U.S. in March 2010, using our own specialty sales force, and had net revenue of $493 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Since the March 2010 launch of Ampyra, approximately 120,000 people with MS in the U.S. have tried Ampyra. We believe that Ampyra is increasingly considered by many physicians a standard of care to improve walking in people with MS. Seven years after approval, Ampyra continues to grow, reflecting the continued unmet medical need among people with MS for a treatment to improve walking. Our 60-day free trial program provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. 
 Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. – Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare – have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA’s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans.
 Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH (formerly Biogen Idec International GmbH), or Biogen, under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2017. Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of Fampyra and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones.

 Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers, who have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Amypra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they have also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016 and we are waiting for the Court’s decision. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of these four generic companies. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are also subject to inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These IPR petitions challenge four of the five Orange Book-listed patents. The USPTO held an oral argument regarding the IPR petitions on January 19, 2017, and a ruling on the IPR petitions is expected in March 2017. An adverse outcome in either of these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange Book-listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. On February 24, 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology
 CVT-301 is self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease causes a range of symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease.
 CVT-301 delivers a precise dose of dry-powder formulation of L-dopa to the lung. Oral medication can be absorbed with slow and variable onset of action, as the medicine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract before reaching the brain. Inhaled treatments enter the body through the lungs and reach the brain shortly thereafter, bypassing the digestive system. CVT-301 is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. This platform allows delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with conventional dry powder formulations using a simple, breath-actuated proprietary inhaler. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents. 
 In 2016, we completed a Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of CVT-301 for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. On February 9, 2017, we announced efficacy and safety data from this clinical trial, showing a statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. The 
 3


clinical trial had three arms: CVT-301 84 mg and 60 mg doses (equivalent to 50 mg and 35 mg fine particle doses, respectively), and placebo. The trial met its primary outcome measure of improvement in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS Part III) in people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures Parkinson’s disease motor impairment. The primary endpoint was measured at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose at the 12-week visit. UPDRS Part III change was -9.83 compared to -5.91 for placebo with a p value of 0.009. The magnitude of CVT-301’s benefit versus baseline was consistent with the data from the prior Phase 2b clinical trial, further described below, and represents a moderate to large clinically important difference. The placebo-adjusted difference was lower in the Phase 3 clinical trial than the Phase 2b clinical trial but still represented a clinically important difference.
 The safety profile of CVT-301 in the trial was consistent with that observed in a prior Phase 2b clinical trial. Adverse events reported in any study arm at greater than 5% were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, nausea and sputum discoloration. Cough was the most common adverse event, reported by approximately 15% of subjects who received CVT-301. When reported, it was typically mild and reported once per participant during the course of treatment. Three of 227 participants receiving CVT-301 discontinued the study due to cough. Reports of serious adverse events were: 3, or 2.7% in the placebo arm, 6, or 5.3% in the 60 mg arm, and 2, or 1.8% in the 84 mg arm. There was one death in the study, a suicide in the 60 mg group, judged by the investigator not to be related to drug. We are currently conducting two additional Phase 3 studies to assess the long-term safety profile of CVT-301. Up to 12-month data from these studies are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
 We had a pre-NDA (New Drug Application) meeting with the FDA during the third quarter of 2016 and have received the FDA’s minutes of that meeting. We plan to file an NDA with the FDA in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter of 2017, pending data from the ongoing long-term safety studies. We also plan to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU by the end of 2017 pending additional data analyses. We expect that the NDA will be filed under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from the branded L-dopa product Sinemet®. We believe the Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial, combined with data from the two additional Phase 3 studies and supported by existing Phase 2b data, will be sufficient for filing an NDA. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of CVT-301 in the U.S. alone could exceed $500 million. We are actively seeking to partner this program outside of the U.S., the EU and certain other countries.
 In June 2015, we presented data from a Phase 2b clinical trial of CVT-301 at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The data showed that patients experiencing an OFF period, treated with CVT-301, experienced significantly greater improvements in motor function than patients treated with an inhaled placebo; the difference in improvement was already apparent 10 minutes after dosing and was durable for at least an hour, the longest time point at which patients were measured. In April 2016, data from this clinical trial were one of six platform presentations highlighted during the Movement Disorders Invited Science Session at the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. In June 2016, data from this clinical trial was also presented in three posters during the 20th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). In October 2016, we announced that results from Phase 1, Phase 2a and preclinical studies of CVT-301 were featured in the current edition of Science Translational Medicine.
 In addition to CVT-301, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. Disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, in addition to Parkinson’s disease, may be addressed by ARCUS products with the delivery of active agents to the CNS with rapid onset and reduced systemic exposure. For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan (zolmitriptan) intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS drug delivery technology. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. 
 In December 2015, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic clinical trial of CVT-427 for acute treatment of migraine. In June 2016, at the 58th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Headache Society, we presented pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 trial which showed increased bioavailability and faster absorption 
 4


compared to oral and nasal administration of the same active ingredient in healthy adults. In particular, the data showed that CVT-427 had a median Tmax of about 12 minutes for all dose levels compared to 1.5 hours for the oral tablet and 3.0 hours for the nasal spray. There were no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, evidence of acute bronchoconstriction or discontinuations due to adverse events reported in this study. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were cough, chest discomfort, headache, and feeling hot. Apart from cough, single dose CVT-427 tolerability was generally consistent with the known safety profile of zolmitriptan. We have also completed a special population study to evaluate safe inhalation of CVT-427 in patients with asthma and in smokers. Some subjects in this study showed evidence of acute, reversible bronchoconstriction, post-inhalation. We plan to discuss these results with outside advisors and the FDA and, pending agreement, to advance the program into Phase 2 study by the end of 2017. 
 Biotie Acquisition; Tozadenant, SYN120 and BTT1023
 In 2016, we acquired Biotie Therapies Corp. pursuant to a combination agreement with Biotie for a purchase price of approximately $376 million. On September 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of Biotie. Previously, in April and May, 2016, we had acquired approximately 97% of the fully diluted capital stock of Biotie pursuant to public tender offers. On September 30, 2016, we acquired shares representing the remaining approximately 3% of Biotie's fully diluted capital stock pursuant to compulsory redemption proceedings under Finnish law that we had initiated in April 2016. Pursuant to these redemption proceedings, we were entitled to acquire these remaining Biotie shares in exchange for our provision of a cash security deposit pending a final determination and payment of the redemption price for these shares. In November 2016, the arbitration tribunal administering the redemption proceedings rendered a decision in our favor, confirming that the price for the remaining unpaid shares would be the same as the price per share set forth in the combination agreement and offered and paid to the other Biotie shareholders. We made the remaining payments in January 2017. The arbitration decision was not appealed and became final and binding in February 2017.
 Pursuant to the acquisition, we acquired worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time. A2a receptor antagonists have the potential to be the first new class of drug approved in the U.S. for improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease in over 20 years. We believe that tozadenant would be complementary to our other Phase 3 product for Parkinson's disease, CVT-301, because while tozadenant is being developed as a chronic therapy for reducing overall OFF time, CVT-301 is being developed for episodic use for rapid improvement of OFF periods when they occur. Biotie is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in which tozadenant is taken along with a person’s other Parkinson’s disease therapies. The trial, which is being conducted under a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA, is assessing improvement of motor function and activities of daily living in people with Parkinson’s disease while taking tozadenant. We believe that this trial, if successful, together with data from a prior Phase 2b clinical trial, will provide sufficient efficacy data to file an NDA. We expect efficacy data from this trial in the first quarter of 2018. A separate open-label safety study is expected to begin enrollment in the first half of 2017.
 Further expanding our pipeline, through Biotie we also obtained global rights to SYN120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A dual receptor antagonist in Phase 2 development with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s-related dementia. We expect to complete an ongoing Phase 2 exploratory study in the second half of 2017 and we expect data from this trial in the first quarter of 2018.
 Biotie is also developing BTT1023 (timolumab), a product candidate for the orphan disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, or PSC, a chronic and progressive liver disease. There are no approved drug therapies for PSC, and liver transplant is the only treatment. Interim data from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of BTT1023 for PSC are expected in the second half of 2017. We are seeking to out-license this program.
 Also, Biotie receives double digit royalties from sales of Selincro, a European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved orally administered therapy for alcohol dependence therapy. Selincro has been introduced across Europe in 29 countries by Biotie’s partner, H. Lundbeck A/S, a Danish pharmaceutical company specializing in central nervous system products. Selincro is not approved for use in the U.S. and is not under development for use in the U.S.
 Remyelinating Antibodies
 We are developing rHIgM22, a remyelinating antibody, as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. In 2013, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of rHIgM22 to assess the safety and tolerability of rHIgM22 in patients with MS. The study also included several exploratory clinical, imaging and biomarker measures. We announced top-line safety and 
 5


tolerability results in February 2015. The trial, which followed participants for up to six months after receiving a single dose of rHIgM22, found no dose-limiting toxicities at any of the five dose levels studied. In April 2015, we presented additional safety data from this trial showing that rHIgM22 was well tolerated in each of the five doses, supporting additional clinical development. In October 2015, we presented pharmacokinetics from the trial in patients with stable MS, confirming that rHIgM22 penetrates the central nervous system. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect to complete the trial in the second half of 2017. We are actively seeking a partner for further development of this program after completion of this trial.
 Cimaglermin alfa/Neuregulins
 Cimaglermin alfa is our lead product candidate for our neuregulin program. We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in heart failure patients. This was a dose-escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose, with follow-up assessments at one, three, and six months. Data from this trial showed a dose-related improvement in ejection fraction in addition to safety findings. A dose-limiting report of hepatoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting FDA Drug-Induced Liver Injury Guidance (FDA 2009) stopping rules was also identified in the highest planned dose cohort, which resolved over two to three weeks. In 2015, we presented new analyses of data from this trial, which found that cimaglermin produced a dose-dependent benefit at multiple time points for up to three months following a single infusion.
 In 2013, we commenced a second clinical trial of cimaglermin. This Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure is assessing tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin, which were tested in the first trial, and also includes assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. In 2015, we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting the FDA guidelines referenced above. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information, and the trial remains subject to this clinical hold. The abnormal blood tests resolved within two to three weeks, as was the case with the one case of hepatoxicity reported in the previous Phase 1 study noted above. The 22 patients who were dosed in the trial have completed the pre-planned one year of follow up. Outside of the hepatoxicity case, the safety profile from this trial was consistent with our first Phase 1 trial, but efficacy data was inconclusive which we believe was in part due to the very small number of patients in the trial. We have ongoing analyses and non-clinical studies to further define the nature of the bilirubin signal. We have met with the FDA to present analysis of the data from the cimaglermin studies, as well as data from non-clinical studies, as part of our request that the program be removed from the clinical hold. We are seeking to out-license this program.
 Ampyra/Dalfampridine Development Program
 We have been studying the use of dalfampridine in patients who experience post-stroke walking difficulties, or PSWD, after experiencing an ischemic stroke. In 2016, we made the decision to stop enrollment in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial and conduct an unblinded analysis of the trial data. In November 2016, we announced we were discontinuing our PSWD program after reviewing the unblinded data and concluding that the results did not show sufficient efficacy to support further development. We have also been exploring a once-daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in our PSWD clinical program. A multi-dose pharmacokinetic study confirmed that we have developed a potentially viable QD formulation of dalfampridine.
Plumiaz
 Plumiaz is a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, for the treatment of people with epilepsy currently on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures. In 2013, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Plumiaz to the FDA. In May 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Plumiaz NDA. In May 2015, we announced that we completed discussions with the FDA, and thereafter we continued to advance development of Plumiaz. Based on these discussions, we were conducting three clinical trials for Plumiaz. However, in May 2016 we announced that we were discontinuing the program because data from clinical trials did not demonstrate Plumiaz's bioequivalence to Diastat® rectal gel. Specifically, the data demonstrated unexpectedly lower nasal mucosa absorption of diazepam in persons with epilepsy compared to studies in healthy volunteers.

Corporate Update
 In January 2016, we engaged Burkhard Blank, M.D., to assume the responsibilities of Chief Medical Officer on an interim basis, and in July 2016, we appointed Dr. Blank as our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Blank has more than 25 years of industry experience, holding senior leadership positions with responsibility for managing international clinical trial programs, as well as heading regulatory affairs, statistics, drug safety and related departments.
 In October 2016, we announced the departure of Mr. Michael Rogers, our former Chief Financial Officer. In connection with Mr. Rogers' departure, David Lawrence, previously Chief of Business Operations, assumed the role of Chief, Business Operations and Principal Accounting Officer. In that role, he is carrying out principal financial officer responsibilities. Andrew Hindman, the Company's Chief Business Development Officer, assumed responsibility for Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to continue to grow as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company and to become a leading neurology company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We are seeking to leverage our scientific, clinical and commercial expertise in neurology and focusing on Parkinson’s disease, migraine and MS. Following are our 2017 strategic priorities:

• | Advancing our late stage Parkinson’s disease programs, including: CVT-301, a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, using our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease; and tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time.

Background on Neurological Conditions
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. Where our neurology programs may also show promise for disorders outside of the nervous system, we may elect to pursue these opportunistically as well. Currently, we are focused on developing and marketing therapeutics targeted to the conditions described below. We believe there is significant unmet medical need for these conditions, which can severely impact the lives of those who suffer from them.
Multiple Sclerosis
 Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, usually progressive disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses, much as insulation facilitates conduction in an electrical wire. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body's own immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the central nervous system, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. Patients with MS may suffer impairments in a wide range of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments 
 8


they suffer on a day-to-day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day.
 Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Parkinson’s Disease
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons responsible for producing dopamine, which causes motor complications, including impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremors. Approximately one million Americans and 1.2 million Europeans suffer from Parkinson’s disease. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson’s disease. Current treatment strategies are focused on the management and reduction of the major symptoms of the disease and related disabilities. These therapies either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is oral carbidopa/levodopa. Approximately 70% of people with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. are treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa. Effective control of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is referred to as an ON state.
 As Parkinson’s disease progresses, even optimized regimens of oral carbidopa/levodopa are associated with increasingly wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption into the bloodstream. This results in the unreliable control of symptoms, leading to motor complications including OFF periods. OFF periods, which are characterized by a re-emergence of Parkinson’s disease symptoms, can increase in frequency and severity during the course of the disease. OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies. About half of people with Parkinson’s disease treated with L-dopa therapy experience OFF periods within five years of initiating treatment. For the approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. and 420,000 in Europe who experience them, OFF periods are inadequately addressed by available therapies and are considered one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing people with Parkinson’s disease. OFF periods can be very disruptive to the lives of people with Parkinson’s disease, their families and caregivers.
 According to recent studies following people with Parkinson’s disease over the entire course of their illness, approximately 50-80% may experience dementia. Some studies have reported that the average time from onset of Parkinson’s disease to developing dementia is about 10 years. Dementia is a physical change in the brain that causes a decline in the brain’s ability to process and understand information, and can affect thinking, perception, and mood. As Parkinson’s disease progresses over time, Parkinson’s disease-related dementia can cause problems with: memory loss and forgetfulness; speaking and communicating with others; problem solving and understanding of complex ideas; paying attention; emotional control, mood, and motivation; confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations. 
 Migraine
 Migraine is a neurological syndrome characterized by pain, nausea, abnormal sensitivity to sound and abnormal sensitivity to light. It is believed to affect over 10% of the global population. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health estimates 12% of the population, or approximately 37 million people, suffer from migraine, with women being nearly three times more affected than men. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans.
Spasticity
 Spasticity refers to the often painful involuntary tensing, stiffening or contracting of muscles. Spasticity is not a disease but a symptom of other conditions, such as MS, SCI, stroke, traumatic brain injury and cerebral palsy, where portions of the 
 9


nervous system that control voluntary movement have been damaged. This damage results in the nerve cells in the spinal cord becoming disconnected from controlling centers in the brain and, as a result, transmitting unregulated impulses to the muscles. People who have spasticity may experience it intermittently – it may be triggered by a stimulus, such as pain, pressure sores, cold weather or a urinary tract infection. The majority of people with MS experience some form of spasticity, as do many people following stroke, SCI, or brain injuries. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, spasticity affects more than an estimated 12 million people worldwide.
 Ampyra
 Ampyra (dalfampridine) is an oral drug approved by the FDA on January 22, 2010 as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). Ampyra can be used alone or with concurrent medications, including immunomodulatory drugs. The majority of patients in our two Phase 3 clinical trials for Ampyra (63%) were taking immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab). Ampyra is an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), which was previously referred to as fampridine.
 We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, which are described below in the “Intellectual Property” section of this report, providing protection up to 2027. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers, who have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Amypra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they have also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016 and we are waiting for the Court’s decision. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of these four generic companies. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are also subject to inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These IPR petitions challenge four of the five Orange Book-listed patents. The USPTO held an oral argument regarding the IPR petitions on January 19, 2016, and a ruling on the IPR petitions is expected in March 2017. An adverse outcome in either of these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange Book-listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen under a 2009 license and collaboration agreement. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2017.
 Background
 Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons through blocking of potassium channels. The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated.
Clinical Studies and Safety Profile
 Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Ampyra was based on data from a comprehensive development program assessing the safety and efficacy of Ampyra, including two Phase 3 trials that involved 540 people with MS. The primary measure of efficacy in our two Phase 3 MS trials was walking speed (in feet per second) as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), using a responder analysis. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double-blind period than the maximum speed achieved in the five non-double-blind, no treatment visits (four before the double-blind period and one after). A significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily were responders compared to patients taking placebo, as measured by the T25FW (Trial 1: 34.8% vs. 8.3%; Trial 2: 42.9% vs. 9.3%). The increased response rate in the Ampyra group was observed across all four major types of MS. During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo. In both trials, the consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient 
 10


self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug vs. placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure.
 In October 2015, we presented 5-year post-marketing safety data for dalfampridine extended release tablets in MS at the 31st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. The data presented continue to be consistent with those reported in double-blind clinical trials, with incidence of reported seizure remaining stable over time.
 The FDA’s approval letter included certain post-marketing study requirements and confirmed certain commitments made by us with respect to Ampyra, all of which we have now completed. The post-marketing requirements included additional animal toxicology studies to evaluate certain impurities, in-vitro receptor binding and abuse potential studies in animals, and an evaluation of clinical adverse events related to abuse potential. We completed these studies and timely submitted the results to the FDA. Also, we committed to the FDA that we would conduct a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a 5 mg twice-daily dosing regimen of Ampyra, as well as a pharmacokinetic evaluation of a 7.5 mg dosage strength in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. We also committed to report all post-marketing seizure events on an expedited basis to the FDA. We completed the renal impairment study and timely submitted the results to the FDA. We are discussing with the FDA what additional steps may need to be taken. In August 2012, we announced results of the 5mg efficacy study. The study failed to confirm efficacy of the 5mg dose. We believe that this study, together with Ampyra registration studies, continue to show that 10mg twice daily is the appropriate, safe, and effective dose. The study results were provided to the FDA, which subsequently confirmed that we have satisfied this post-marketing requirement.
 In our two Phase 3 clinical studies of Ampyra in spinal cord injury, which were completed in 2004, the results did not reach statistical significance on their primary endpoints.
 Zanaflex Products
 Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets contain tizanidine hydrochloride, one of the two leading active ingredients used for the management of spasticity. Tizanidine hydrochloride is approved by the FDA as a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. We acquired from Alkermes plc (formerly Elan) all of its U.S. sales, marketing and distribution rights to Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets in July 2004. Zanaflex tablets were approved by the FDA in 1996 and lost compound patent protection in 2002. There are currently a number of generic versions of tizanidine hydrochloride tablets on the market. Zanaflex Capsules were approved by the FDA in 2002, but were never marketed by Elan. We began marketing Zanaflex Capsules in April 2005 as part of our strategy to build a commercial platform for the potential market launch of Ampyra. In February 2012, we launched an authorized generic version of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules under our agreement with Actavis (a Teva Pharmaceuticals subsidiary) following the launch by Apotex Inc. of its generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules. In March 2013, Mylan Laboratories also launched generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules.
 Clinical trials conducted by Elan demonstrated that Zanaflex Capsules, when taken with food, produce average peak levels of tizanidine hydrochloride in a person's blood that are lower and rise more gradually compared to the peak levels following a similar dose of the tablet form. The FDA recognizes these pharmacokinetic differences and therefore has determined that Zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets are not therapeutically equivalent, that is, are not AB-rated to Zanaflex Capsules. As a result, under state pharmacy laws, prescriptions written for Zanaflex Capsules may not be filled by the pharmacist with Zanaflex tablets or generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets, although some substitution does take place in practice. However, they may be filled with generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules or our authorized generic capsules.
 Qutenza
 Qutenza is a dermal patch containing 8% prescription strength capsaicin the effects of which can last up to three months and is approved by the FDA for the management of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, also known as post-shingles pain. We acquired commercialization rights to Qutenza in July 2013 from NeurogesX, Inc. These rights include the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. Grunenthal GmbH (as the assignee of Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.) has exclusive commercialization rights for Qutenza in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein as well as Switzerland, certain countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Research and Development Programs
 We have a pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, migraine and MS. We have three clinical-stage programs in Parkinson’s disease, including CVT-301, our most advanced clinical program and our highest priority, as well as our tozadenant and SYN120 programs which we acquired with Biotie. We believe these three clinical development programs position Acorda as a leader in Parkinson’s disease therapeutic development. These programs and the other programs in our pipeline are described below.
 CVT-301, CVT 427 and ARCUS Technology
 CVT-301 is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease causes a range of symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease.
 CVT-301 delivers a precise dose of dry-powder formulation of L-dopa to the lung. Oral medication can be absorbed with slow and variable onset of action, as the medicine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract before reaching the brain. Inhaled treatments enter the body through the lungs and reach the brain shortly thereafter, bypassing the digestive system. CVT-301 is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. This platform allows delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with conventional dry powder formulations using a simple, breath-actuated proprietary inhaler. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents.
 In 2016, we completed a Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of CVT-301 for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. On February 9, 2017, we announced efficacy and safety data from this clinical trial, showing a statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. The clinical trial had three arms: CVT-301 84 mg and 60 mg doses (equivalent to 50 mg and 35 mg fine particle doses, respectively), and placebo. The trial met its primary outcome measure of improvement in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS Part III) in people with Parkinson’s disease experiencing OFF periods. UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures Parkinson’s disease motor impairment. The primary endpoint was measured at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose at the 12-week visit. UPDRS Part III change was -9.83 compared to -5.91 for placebo with a p value of 0.009. The magnitude of CVT-301’s benefit versus baseline was consistent with the data from the prior Phase 2b clinical trial, further described below, and represents a moderate to large clinically important difference. The placebo-adjusted difference was lower in the Phase 3 clinical trial than the Phase 2b clinical trial but still represented a clinically important difference.
 The safety profile of CVT-301 in the trial was consistent with that observed in a prior Phase 2b clinical trial. Adverse events reported in any study arm at greater than 5% were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, nausea and sputum discoloration. Cough was the most common adverse event, reported by approximately 15% of subjects who received CVT-301. When reported, it was typically mild and reported once per participant during the course of treatment. Three of 227 participants receiving CVT-301 discontinued the study due to cough. Reports of serious adverse events were: 3, or 2.7% in the placebo arm, 6, or 5.3% in the 60 mg arm, and 2, or 1.8% in the 84 mg arm. There was one death in the study, a suicide in the 60 mg group, judged by the investigator not to be related to drug. We are currently conducting two additional Phase 3 studies to assess the long-term safety profile of CVT-301. Up to 12-month data from these studies are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
 We had a pre-NDA (New Drug Application) meeting with the FDA during the third quarter of 2016 and have received the FDA’s minutes of that meeting. We plan to file an NDA with the FDA in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter of 2017, pending data from the ongoing long-term safety studies. We also plan to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the EU by the end of 2017 pending additional data analyses. We expect that the NDA will be filed under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from the branded L-dopa product Sinemet®. We believe the Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial, combined with data from the two additional Phase 3 studies and supported by existing Phase 2b data, will be sufficient for filing an NDA. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of 
 12


CVT-301 in the U.S. alone could exceed $500 million. We are actively seeking to partner this program outside of the U.S., the EU and certain other countries.
 In June 2015, we presented data from a Phase 2b clinical trial of CVT-301 at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The data showed that patients experiencing an OFF period, treated with CVT-301, experienced significantly greater improvements in motor function than patients treated with an inhaled placebo; the difference in improvement was already apparent 10 minutes after dosing and was durable for at least an hour, the longest time point at which patients were measured. In April 2016, data from this clinical trial were one of six platform presentations highlighted during the Movement Disorders Invited Science Session at the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. In June 2016, data from this clinical trial was also presented in three posters during the 20th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). In October 2016, we announced that results from Phase 1, Phase 2a and preclinical studies of CVT-301 were featured in the current edition of Science Translational Medicine.
 In addition to CVT-301, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. Disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, in addition to Parkinson’s disease, may be addressed by ARCUS products with the delivery of active agents to the CNS with rapid onset and reduced systemic exposure. For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan (zolmitriptan) intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS drug delivery technology. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. 
 In December 2015, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic clinical trial of CVT-427 for acute treatment of migraine. In June 2016, at the 58th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Headache Society, we presented pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 trial which showed increased bioavailability and faster absorption compared to oral and nasal administration of the same active ingredient in healthy adults. In particular, the data showed that CVT-427 had a median Tmax of about 12 minutes for all dose levels compared to 1.5 hours for the oral tablet and 3.0 hours for the nasal spray. There were no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, evidence of acute bronchoconstriction or discontinuations due to adverse events reported in this study. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were cough, chest discomfort, headache, and feeling hot. Apart from cough, single dose CVT-427 tolerability was generally consistent with the known safety profile of zolmitriptan. We have also completed a special population study to evaluate safe inhalation of CVT-427 in patients with asthma and in smokers. Some subjects in this study showed evidence of acute, reversible bronchoconstriction, post-inhalation. We plan to discuss these results with outside advisors and the FDA and, pending agreement, to advance the program into Phase 2 study by the end of 2017. 
 In July 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a $1.4 million grant to support the development of a formulation and delivery system for a dry powder version of lung surfactant, a treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS. The formulation will be based on our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology, and will be produced in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. RDS is a condition affecting newborns in which fluid collects in the lungs' air sacs; it most commonly affects infants born prematurely. It can be fatal, or lead to severe, chronic health issues caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the baby’s brain and other organs. The syndrome is caused by the infants’ inability to produce enough surfactant, a liquid lining the inside of the lungs. Delivering liquid surfactant to the lungs via intubation is the standard of care. This grant will support the development of a portable and easily administered inhaled form of surfactant, which may present a more practical alternative for use in developing areas of the world, where intubation poses numerous problems. This program is not aimed at developing a commercial product, but our work on this program could potentially generate information that is useful for adapting the ARCUS drug delivery technology to commercial pediatric uses.
 Tozadenant
 We own (through Biotie) worldwide rights to tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist currently in Phase 3 development as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time. A2a receptor 
 13


antagonists have the potential to be the first new class of drug approved in the U.S. for improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease in over 20 years. We believe that tozadenant would be complementary to our other Phase 3 product for Parkinson's disease, CVT-301, because while tozadenant is being developed as a chronic therapy for reducing overall OFF time, CVT-301 is being developed for episodic use for rapid improvement of OFF periods when they occur. 
 Biotie previously conducted a Phase 2b clinical trial of tozadenant in people with Parkinson’s disease who have motor fluctuations on levodopa, among other chronic medicines. The study compared four individual dose arms versus a placebo arm. The primary outcome was a reduction in OFF time, as determined by a patient diary. The clinical trial showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in OFF time. 
 Biotie is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in which tozadenant is taken along with a person’s other Parkinson’s disease therapies. The trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment, or SPA, from the FDA and is comparing two of the dose arms of tozadenant that were studied in the Phase 2b clinical trial versus placebo. The trial is assessing improvement of motor function and activities of daily living in people with Parkinson’s disease while taking tozadenant. We believe that this trial, if successful, together with data from the prior Phase 2b clinical trial, will provide sufficient efficacy data to file an NDA with the FDA. We expect efficacy data from this trial in the first quarter of 2018. A separate open-label safety study is expected to begin enrollment in the first half of 2017.
 SYN120
 We own (through Biotie) worldwide rights to SYN120, an oral, 5-HT6/5-HT2A dual receptor antagonist in Phase 2 development with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s-related dementia. Dementia is a physical change in the brain that causes a decline in the brain’s ability to process and understand information, and can affect thinking, perception and mood. As Parkinson’s disease progresses over time, Parkinson’s disease-related dementia can cause problems with: memory loss and forgetfulness; speaking and communicating with others; problem solving and understanding of complex ideas; paying attention; emotional control, mood, and motivation; and confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations. According to recent studies following people with Parkinson’s disease over the entire course of their illness, approximately 50-80% may experience dementia. Some studies have reported that the average time from onset of Parkinson’s disease to developing dementia is about 10 years. We expect to complete an ongoing Phase 2 exploratory study in the second half of 2017 and we expect data from this trial in the first quarter of 2018.
 BTT1023
 We own (through Biotie) worldwide rights to BTT1023 (timolumab), a product candidate for the orphan disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, or PSC. PSC is a rare, chronic disease that damages the bile ducts over time. Bile fluid is an essential aid to digestion that is made in the liver. In people with PSC, the bile ducts become blocked due to inflammation and scarring (fibrosis). This causes bile to accumulate in the liver, where it gradually damages liver cells and eventually results in liver failure. There are no approved drug therapies for PSC and liver transplant is the only treatment.
 Although the mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, BTT1023 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets VAP-1 (vascular adhesion protein-1). Biotie conducted multiple preclinical and clinical studies suggesting VAP-1 may play a role in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, are the result of the immune system mistakenly attacking the body’s own cells and tissue. Fibrotic diseases, such as PSC and cirrhosis of the liver, are characterized by the formation of scar tissue that prevents normal function of the body’s organs.
 A Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial is ongoing and is being funded through the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Program, a Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research partnership in the United Kingdom. Interim data from this clinical trial are expected in the second half of 2017.
 BTT1023 has been granted orphan drug designation for PSC by FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We are seeking to out-license this program.
 Remyelinating Antibodies Program
 Our remyelinating antibodies program is based on our research collaboration with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic. Under a license agreement entered into with Mayo Clinic in September 2000, we 
 14


have exclusive worldwide rights to patents and other intellectual property for these antibodies related to nervous system disorders. Studies have demonstrated the ability of this family of antibodies to stimulate repair of the myelin sheath in three different animal models of MS. In particular, these antibodies were found to react with molecules on the surface of the cells that make the myelin sheath and stimulate them, leading to increased remyelination activity. Some antibodies within this portfolio also stimulate the growth of neurons and may have applications beyond demyelinating disorders. First identified in mice, similar remyelinating antibodies were subsequently identified in human blood samples by Mayo Clinic and we have been able to produce a recombinant human antibody (rHIgM22) that may be suitable for clinical development.
 We are developing rHIgM22, a remyelinating antibody, as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. In April 2013, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of rHIgM22 to assess the safety and tolerability of rHIgM22 in patients with MS. The study also included several exploratory clinical, imaging and biomarker measures. We announced top-line safety and tolerability results in February 2015. The trial, which followed participants for up to six months after receiving a single dose of rHIgM22, found no dose-limiting toxicities at any of the five dose levels studied. In April 2015, we presented additional safety data from this trial showing that rHIgM22 was well tolerated in each of the five doses, supporting additional clinical development. In October 2015, we presented pharmacokinetics from the trial in patients with stable MS, confirming that rHIgM22 penetrates the central nervous system.
 We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect to complete the trial in the second half of 2017. We are actively seeking a partner for further development of this program after completion of this trial.
 Ampyra/Dalfampridine Development Programs
 We have been studying the use of dalfampridine in patients who experience post-stroke walking difficulties, or PSWD, after experiencing an ischemic stroke. In 2016, we made the decision to stop enrollment in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial and conduct an unblinded analysis of the trial data. In November 2016, we announced we were discontinuing our PSWD program after reviewing the unblinded data and concluding that the results did not show sufficient efficacy to support further development. We have also been exploring a once-daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in our PSWD clinical program. A multi-dose pharmacokinetic study confirmed that we have developed a potentially viable QD formulation of dalfampridine.
 Cimaglermin alfa/Neuregulins
 Cimaglermin alfa is a member of the neuregulin growth factor family, and has been shown to promote recovery after neurological injury, as well as enhance heart function in animal models of heart failure. The neuregulin growth factors are related to epidermal growth factor. These molecules bind to erbB receptors, which translate the growth factor signal and cause changes in cell growth, protein production and gene expression. Neuregulins have been shown in published studies to have a range of effects in protection and repair of cells both in the nervous system and in the heart. In 2002, we obtained from Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc), or Paion, an exclusive worldwide license to its neuregulin patents and related technology.
 Neuregulins covered in the portfolio from Paion have a number of potential applications. Neuregulins and their erbB receptors are essential for cardiac development. They have been shown to protect cardiac muscle cells from stressors that can lead to congestive heart failure, and to enhance function in heart failure induced by myocardial infarction. Additionally, neuregulins have been shown to protect the heart and brain from the toxicity of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines. Studies in mouse, rat and dog models of congestive heart failure have shown that neuregulins significantly improve cardiac function and survival. Neuregulins have been shown to stimulate remyelination in animal models of MS and to protect the brain in animal models of stroke. Therefore, neuregulins offer the potential for multiple central nervous system and cardiac indications, including MS, stroke and heart failure as well as protection from chemotherapy-induced damage.
 Cimaglermin alfa is our lead product candidate for our neuregulin program. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of cimaglermin in heart failure patients. This was a dose-escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose, with follow-up assessments at one, three, and six months. Data from this trial showed a dose-related improvement in ejection fraction in addition to safety findings. A dose-limiting report of hepatoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting FDA Drug-Induced Liver Injury Guidance (FDA 2009) stopping rules was 
 15


also identified in the highest planned dose cohort, which resolved over two to three weeks. Further analyses of data from this trial found that cimaglermin produced a dose-dependent benefit at multiple time points for up to three months following a single infusion.
 In 2013, we commenced a second clinical trial of cimaglermin. This Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure is assessing tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin, which were tested in the first trial, and also includes assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. We selected heart failure as the initial indication because of the strength of the preclinical data, the availability of clear outcome measures, and the potential market size. In 2015 we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting the FDA guidelines referenced above. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information, and the trial remains subject to this clinical hold. The abnormal blood tests resolved within two to three weeks, as was the case with the one case of hepatoxicity reported in the previous Phase 1 study noted above. The 22 patients who were dosed in the trial have completed the pre-planned one year of follow up. Outside of the hepatoxicity case, the safety profile from this trial was consistent with our first Phase 1 trial, but efficacy data was inconclusive which we believe was in part due to the very small number of patients in the trial. We have ongoing analyses and non-clinical studies to further define the nature of the bilirubin signal. We have met with the FDA to present analysis of the data from the cimaglermin studies, as well as data from non-clinical studies, as part of our request that the program be removed from clinical hold. We are seeking to out-license this program.
 Chondroitinase Program
 This program is focused on researching the potential use of chondroitinase as a treatment of injuries to the spinal cord and brain, as well as other neurotraumatic indications. Published research has demonstrated that a matrix of scar tissue that develops from injury to the central nervous system, or CNS, is partly responsible for limiting the regeneration of nerve fibers in the CNS. A similar matrix exists even in uninjured parts of the CNS tissue and restricts plasticity, the ability to modify or re-establish nerve connections. One or both forms of matrix may also inhibit repair of the myelin sheath by restricting the movements of the myelinating cells into the area of damage. 
 A major component of these two forms of matrix are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, or CSPGs. Cell culture studies and a number of animal studies have shown that these CSPGs inhibit the growth of nerve fibers and are likely to be key factors in the failure of the spinal cord or brain to regenerate and repair. Studies also have shown that bacterial enzymes called chondroitinases break down the CSPG molecules, thereby reducing their inhibitory activity.
 This program is in the research and translational development phase and has not yet entered formal preclinical development.
 NP-1998
 NP-1998 is a Phase 3 ready, 20% prescription strength capsaicin topical solution that we were assessing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. We acquired rights to NP-1998 from NeurogesX, Inc. in 2013 in connection with our purchase of Qutenza, an FDA-approved dermal patch containing 8% prescription strength capsaicin. We acquired development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. Grunenthal GmbH (as the assignee of Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.) has an option to develop NP-1998 in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein as well as Switzerland certain countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 We made certain upfront payments to acquire the Qutenza and NP-1998 assets from NeurogesX, and may also make up to $5.0 million in payments contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to NP-1998. We believe this liquid formulation of the capsaicin-based therapy has key advantages over the Qutenza patch, and we believe NP-1998 has the potential to treat multiple neuropathies. However, we have no current plans to invest in further development of NP-1998 for neuropathic pain. 
 Plumiaz
 We had been developing Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam, for the treatment of people with epilepsy on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, who experience bouts of increased seizure activity, also known 
 16


as seizure clusters or acute repetitive seizures, or ARS. In 2013, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Plumiaz to the FDA. Plumiaz was filed under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from a therapy previously approved by the FDA (DIASTAT® Rectal Gel) and providing pharmacokinetic data comparing the reference product to Plumiaz. In May 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Plumiaz NDA. In May 2015, we announced that we completed discussions with the FDA, and thereafter we continued to advance development of Plumiaz. Based on these discussions, we were conducting three clinical trials for Plumiaz. However, in May 2016 we announced that we were discontinuing the program because data from clinical trials did not demonstrate Plumiaz's bioequivalence to Diastat® rectal gel. Specifically, the data demonstrated unexpectedly lower nasal mucosa absorption of diazepam in persons with epilepsy compared to studies in healthy volunteers. Our Neuronex, Inc. subsidiary is a party to a license agreement with SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. relating to Plumiaz. 
 Sales, Marketing and Market Access
 Ampyra
 Since the March 2010 launch of Ampyra, approximately 120,000 people with MS in the U.S. have tried Ampyra. We believe that Ampyra is increasingly considered by many physicians a standard of care to improve walking in people with MS. Seven years after approval, Ampyra continues to grow, reflecting the continued unmet medical need among people with MS for a treatment to improve walking. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 70% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra received a first refill, and approximately 40% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra have been dispensed at least six months of the medicine through refills, consistent with previously reported trends. These refill rates exclude patients who started Ampyra through our 60-day free trial program. Our 60-day free trial program provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. During 2016, on average, approximately 80% of new Ampyra patients enrolled in 60-day free trial. The program is in its sixth year, and data show that 60-day free trial participants have higher compliance and persistency rates over time compared to patients not in the program. Approximately 50% of patients who initiate therapy with the 60-day free trial free trial program convert to paid prescriptions.
 We have established our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to market Ampyra. We currently have approximately 90 sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately 7,000 physicians. We also have established teams of Medical Science Liaisons, Regional Reimbursement Directors, and Market Access Account Directors who provide information and assistance to payers and physicians on Ampyra; National Trade Account Directors who work with our limited network of specialty pharmacies; and Market Development Managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of our strategic initiatives.
 We have contracted with a third-party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run Ampyra Patient Support Services, or APSS, a dedicated resource of support services that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers, people with MS and insurance carriers. Prescriptions for Ampyra are processed through the APSS center, where dedicated and experienced customer care agents are responsible for helping healthcare professionals process prescriptions; working with insurance carriers to facilitate coverage; and working with a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication directly to a patient’s home. In addition, APSS assists in directing patients to available copay and patient assistance programs, where permitted by law. The process begins when a prescription is submitted by a physician to APSS through a Service Request Form, or SRF. Processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by APSS begins within 24 hours of receipt. Patients will experience a range of times to receive their first shipment based on the processing times for insurance requirements. As with any prescription product, patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription. If insurance coverage is confirmed, APSS will transmit the prescription information to the specialty pharmacy provider that has contracted with the patient’s insurance carrier. The specialty pharmacy provider will then mail the prescription directly to the patient. In some cases, the specialty pharmacy provider will coordinate the insurance benefits investigation on behalf of the patient or will receive a prescription directly from a prescribing physician. Those people with MS who meet income and other requirements may receive Ampyra at no cost, where permitted by law, through Acorda’s patient assistance program. We have also established a program to assist individuals who have private insurance in managing their copayment costs through a copay mitigation program, where permitted by law. 
 We believe that, in general, people with MS are knowledgeable about their conditions, actively seek new treatments, and are directly involved with their prescriber's evaluation of treatment options. We have existing relationships with the major advocacy groups that focus on MS. As an example of our commitment, each year Acorda sponsors numerous National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Walk MS events around the country. These sponsorships allow us to engage thousands of people with MS, as well as their families, physicians and caregivers, in a discussion about the impact of walking impairment on their 
 17


lives. In addition to these efforts, we have implemented a comprehensive series of educational and promotional programs to support Ampyra.
 Ampyra is distributed in the U.S. exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients by mail; Kaiser Permanente, which distributes Ampyra to patients through a closed network of on-site pharmacies; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an AmerisourceBergen affiliate), which distributes Ampyra to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, and other federal agencies. The distribution process through specialty pharmacy providers is well established within the MS community, and physicians and patients are familiar with this model. This distribution process is intended to provide the best possible patient experience, improve patient adherence to the required drug regimen, including dosage, and assist in educating patients regarding the risks associated with Ampyra. The specialty pharmacy providers that deliver Ampyra by mail, and Kaiser Permanente,  are contractually obligated to hold no more than an agreed number of days of inventory, ranging from 10 to 30 calendar days, and some have agreed to hold a minimum of 10 business days of inventory. 
 Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. – Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare – have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA’s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans. 
 Zanaflex
 Zanaflex Capsules are principally distributed through wholesale pharmaceutical distributors to retail pharmacies. Our authorized generic version of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules is marketed under our agreement with Actavis, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceuticals and formerly Watson Pharma.
Qutenza
 Qutenza is distributed in the U.S. by Besse Medical, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to physician offices, and by ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to hospitals and clinics. As a product that must be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting, many commercial health plans and government insurance programs reimburse for Qutenza under the patient’s medical benefit rather than the patient’s pharmacy benefit. As a result of this, most utilization of Qutenza is handled on a “buy-and-bill” basis in which one of the distributors listed above (Besse Medical, Inc. or ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc.) ships the medication to a physician’s office, hospital or clinic to be administered. In those limited number of cases where a payer covers the medication under a patient’s pharmacy benefit, a specialty pharmacy purchases Qutenza from ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., and then ships the medication directly to the physician’s office, rather than dispensing Qutenza to the patient. 
 CVT-301
 We anticipate an incremental expansion of our sales force if CVT-301 is approved. 
 

Material and Other Collaborations and License Agreements
 Biogen (Fampyra)
 In 2009, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which we and Biogen have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of products containing aminopyridines, including Ampyra, initially directed to the treatment of MS (licensed products). The Collaboration Agreement includes a sublicense of our rights under an existing license agreement with Alkermes (formerly Elan). We have also entered into a related Supply Agreement pursuant to which we supply Biogen with its requirements for the licensed products through our existing supply agreement with Alkermes. Biogen Inc., the parent of Biogen, has guaranteed the performance of Biogen's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement.
 18


Under the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen, itself or through its affiliates, has the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the U.S., while we retain the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in the U.S. Each party has the exclusive right to develop licensed products for its commercialization territory, although the parties may also decide to jointly carry out mutually agreed future development activities – including, for example, for our development of dalfampridine in chronic post-stroke walking deficits – under a cost-sharing arrangement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we participate in overseeing the development and commercialization of Ampyra and other licensed products in markets outside the U.S. in part through our participation in joint committees with Biogen. If Biogen does not participate in the development of licensed products for certain indications or forms of administration, it may lose the right to develop and commercialize the licensed products for such indication or form of administration. Biogen may sublicense its rights to certain unaffiliated distributors. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement and for two years after the Collaboration Agreement terminates, neither party nor its affiliates may, other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any competing product, defined as one that contains aminopyridine or any other compound that acts at least in part through direct interaction with potassium channels to improve neurological function in MS, SCI or other demyelinating conditions, except that we may exploit the licensed products anywhere in the world following termination of the Collaboration Agreement.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Biogen anticipates making Fampyra available in additional markets in 2017. 
 In consideration for the rights granted to Biogen under the Collaboration Agreement, we were entitled to a non-refundable upfront payment of $110.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was received in July 2009. Also, in August 2011, we received a $25 million milestone payment from Biogen for approval of Fampyra in the EU. Under our separate license and supply agreements with Alkermes, in 2009 we paid Alkermes $7.7 million of the $110 million upfront Biogen payment and in 2011 we paid Alkermes $1.8 million of the $25 million Biogen milestone payment. We are entitled to receive additional payments from Biogen of up to $10 million based on the successful achievement of future regulatory milestones and up to $365 million based on the successful achievement of future sales milestones. The next expected milestone payment from Biogen would be $15 million, due when ex-U.S. net sales exceed $100 million over four consecutive quarters.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of licensed products by Biogen, its affiliates or certain distributors outside of the U.S. Such royalties for products combining a licensed compound with at least one other clinically active therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic ingredient are determined based on the contribution of the licensed compound to the overall sales or value of the combination product. Biogen may offset against the royalties payable to us a portion of certain royalties that it may need to pay to third parties.
 Biogen exclusively purchases all of Biogen's, its affiliates' and its sublicensees' requirements of the licensed products from us. The purchase price paid by Biogen for licensed products under the Collaboration Agreement and Supply Agreement reflects the prices owed to our suppliers under our supply arrangements with Alkermes or other suppliers. In addition, Biogen pays us, in consideration for its purchase and sale of the licensed products, any amounts due to Alkermes for ex-U.S. sales, including royalties owed under the terms of our existing agreements with Alkermes.
 The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Biogen's royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the latest of expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product, fifteen years following first commercial sale of such licensed product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and the existence of certain levels of sales by competing products. The Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement will automatically terminate upon the termination of our license agreement with Alkermes in its entirety or with respect to all countries outside of the U.S. We cannot terminate our license agreement with Alkermes without Biogen's prior written consent under certain circumstances. Biogen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis at any time upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to our right to accelerate such termination. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the agreement, which termination will be limited to a particular country or region under certain circumstances. However, if Biogen has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our material uncured breach, Biogen may instead elect to keep the agreement in effect, but decrease the royalty rates they pay us by a specified percentage. We may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement if Biogen does not commercially launch a licensed product within a specified time period after receiving regulatory approval for such licensed product or otherwise fails to meet certain commercialization obligations. In addition, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement under certain circumstances if (i) Biogen, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenge certain of our patents or (ii) there is a change in control of Biogen or its parent company or certain dispositions of assets by Biogen, its parent or its affiliated companies, followed by a change in the sales and marketing personnel responsible for the licensed products in Biogen's territory of more than a specified percentage 
 19


within a certain period of time after such change in control or disposition. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and the Collaboration Agreement will terminate automatically if the Supply Agreement is terminated for any reason other than for a material breach that we are responsible for. To the extent permitted by law, each party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement if the other party is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
 If the Supply Agreement is terminated by Biogen for an uncured material breach, we will waive our right for Alkermes to exclusively supply the licensed products to us solely to permit Biogen to negotiate terms with Alkermes for the supply of licensed products to Biogen. If the Supply Agreement is otherwise terminated, Biogen will not have any future obligations to purchase licensed products from us and we will not have any future obligations to supply Biogen with licensed products. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, Biogen will assign to us all regulatory documentation and other information necessary or useful to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries and will grant us a license under Biogen's and its affiliates' relevant patent rights, know-how and trademarks to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries. Such assignment and license will be at no cost to us unless the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by Biogen for a material uncured breach that we are responsible for, in which case the parties will negotiate a payment to Biogen to reflect the net value of such assigned and licensed rights.
 Neither party may assign the agreements without the prior written consent of the other, except to an affiliate or, in certain cases, to a third party acquirer of the party.
 In connection with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen and Alkermes entered into a Consent Agreement with us. Under the Consent Agreement, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of rights to Biogen, and the three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under our agreements with Alkermes with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors; permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities; and, requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 Alkermes (Ampyra)
 We have entered into agreements with Elan Corporation plc, including those described immediately below and elsewhere in this report. In September 2011, Alkermes plc acquired Elan’s Drug Technologies business and Elan transferred our agreements to Alkermes as part of that transaction. Throughout this report, references to “Alkermes” include Alkermes plc and also, as the context may require, Elan Corporation plc as the predecessor to Alkermes plc under our agreements.
 In September 2003, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Elan that replaced two prior license agreements for Ampyra in oral sustained release dosage form. Under this agreement, Elan granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Ampyra for all indications, including SCI, MS and all other indications. We agreed to pay Elan milestone payments of up to $15.0 million, of which we have reached and paid $5.0 million, and royalties based on net sales of products with dalfampridine as the active ingredient. We also agreed to pay Elan 7% of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to Ampyra or other aminopyridine products. As a result of our Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, described above, in 2009 we paid Elan $7.7 million of a $110 million upfront payment we received from Biogen, and in 2011 we paid Elan $1.8 million of a $25 million milestone payment we received from Biogen.
 Alkermes (now the licensor under this agreement due to its 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) is also obligated under this agreement to supply us with our commercial requirements for Ampyra in the U.S., as well as to supply Biogen under the Supply Agreement and Consent Agreement with Fampyra for Biogen’s clinical trials and for Biogen’s commercial requirements.
 Alkermes may terminate our license in countries in which we have a license, if we fail to file for regulatory approvals within a commercially reasonable time after completion and receipt of positive data from all preclinical and clinical studies required for the related NDA equivalent. We could also lose our rights under the license agreement if we fail to launch a product in such countries within 180 days of NDA or equivalent approval and receipt of other needed regulatory approvals, or if we fail to fulfill our payment obligations under the license agreement. If Alkermes terminates our license in any applicable country, Alkermes is entitled to license from us our patent rights and know-how relating to the product and to market the product in the applicable country, subject to royalty payments to us.
 20


We have the right to terminate the Alkermes license at any time by written notice. In addition, the Alkermes license may be immediately terminated by either party following an incurable breach of any term or provision by the other party. The Alkermes license may also be terminated by either party following notice and the expiration of a cure period with respect to an uncured breach by either party.
 Subject to the early termination provisions, the Alkermes license terminates on a country-by-country basis on the last to occur of fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018), the expiration of the last to expire Alkermes patent or the existence of competition in that country.
 Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center (dalfampridine)
 In 1990, Elan licensed from Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, or Rush, know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS. We subsequently licensed this know-how from Elan. In September 2003, we entered into an agreement with Rush and Elan terminating the Rush license to Elan and providing for mutual releases. We also entered into a license agreement with Rush in 2003 in which Rush granted us an exclusive worldwide license to its know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS. 
 We agreed to pay Rush a license fee, milestone payments of up to $1.1 million and royalties based on net sales of the product for neurological indications. We have made or accrued an aggregate of $1.1 in milestone payments and $48.1 million in royalties under this agreement through December 31, 2016. In 2014, with our consent Rush sold its right to receive these royalties along with certain related rights to a third party, though this transfer did not materially change any of our obligations under the license. The FDA approval of Ampyra triggered the final milestone of $750,000, which was paid in 2010. The Rush license may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party and notice. The Rush license may also be terminated upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other party. We also entered into an agreement with Elan relating to the allocation of payments between us and Elan of certain payments to Rush under the Rush license. Subject to the early termination provisions, the Rush license terminates upon expiration of the royalty obligations, which expire fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018).
 Alkermes (ARCUS products)
 On December 27, 2010, Civitas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Alkermes, Inc. pursuant to which Alkermes assigned, sold and transferred to Civitas certain of its rights in certain pulmonary delivery patents and patents applications, certain equipment and instruments relating to pulmonary drug delivery, copies of certain documents and reports relating to pulmonary delivery, certain pulmonary drug delivery inhalers and certain pulmonary drug delivery INDs filed with the FDA. Alkermes also granted to Civitas a non-exclusive sublicense to know-how for the purpose of development and commercialization of ARCUS products. Civitas is permitted to license and sublicense the pulmonary patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain restrictions, as necessary for our business. Without the prior written consent of Alkermes, Civitas is prohibited from assigning the intellectual property acquired from Alkermes, except to an affiliate or to a person that acquires all or substantially all of its business to which the agreement relates, whether by acquisition, sale, merger or otherwise.
 Civitas is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ARCUS products. Civitas is obligated to pay to Alkermes royalties for each licensed product. For licensed products sold by Civitas or an affiliate, Civitas will pay Alkermes a royalty in the mid-single digit percentages in the aggregate. For licensed products sold by a collaboration partner, Civitas will pay Alkermes the lower of either (1) a royalty in the mid-single digit percentage of net sales of licensed products in any given year, or (2) a percentage in the low-to-mid-double digits of all collaboration partner revenue received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the royalty paid be less than a low-single digit percentage of net sales of a licensed product in any given calendar year. Civitas must pay these royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of: (1) the expiration of all patents acquired pursuant to the Alkermes agreement containing valid claims covering such licensed products in such country, or (2) a certain number of years after the launch of such licensed product in each specific country.

The Alkermes agreement remains in effect until expiration of Civitas’s royalty obligations to Alkermes. Royalties are payable to Alkermes on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the patents acquired from Alkermes containing a valid claim covering a product in a particular country and (ii) 12 years and six months after the launch of a product in a country. Either party may terminate the agreement for default of the other party. Civitas may terminate the Alkermes agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Alkermes.
 Roche (Tozadenant and SYN120)
 Our Biotie subsidiary is a party to an amended and restated license agreement with Roche Palo Alto LLC, Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (the “Roche Entities”), pursuant to which Biotie obtained exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide licenses under the Roche Entities’ patent rights and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize products incorporating specified Roche Entities compounds, including tozadenant and SYN120 (classified into tiered programs). Under the license agreement, tozadenant is a Tier 2 compound and SYN120 is a Tier 1 compound. Biotie’s license with respect to products containing Tier 2 compounds, or Tier 2 products, extends to the field of any and all uses to treat or prevent human diseases and disorders. Biotie’s license with respect to products containing Tier 1 compounds, or Tier 1 products, is limited to the field of any and all uses to treat or prevent central nervous system diseases and disorders. Under the terms of the Roche license agreement, following the completion of certain studies, the Roche Entities had the right to opt-in to obtain an exclusive right to develop and commercialize the Tier 1 products and terminate the license granted to Biotie with respect to such Tier 1 products. In June 2012, following Biotie’s completion of the specified studies, the Roche Entities notified Biotie of their decision not to exercise their opt-in right for SYN120. Following the Roche Entities’ decision not to exercise their opt-in right, Biotie retains its licensed global development and commercialization rights to SYN120 under the Roche license agreement.
 Pursuant to the Roche license agreement, Biotie is obligated to make certain milestone payments to the Roche Entities on the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones, totaling up to $37 million for Tier 1 products, including SYN120 and $29 million for Tier 2 products, including tozadenant. Biotie is also obligated to pay the Roche Entities tiered single-digit royalties, starting in the low single digits and increasing to the high single digits, on net sales of licensed products. Biotie’s obligation to pay royalties to the Roche Entities will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed Roche Entities patents, Biotie’s patent rights or patent rights jointly owned with the Roche Entities that cover the composition, use or manufacture of the applicable product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Biotie is required to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities set forth in an agreed upon development plan for SYN120 and must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize, either directly or through affiliates or sublicensees, SYN120 and tozadenant in the U.S. and Europe and in such other markets as Biotie deems commercially reasonable.
 The term of the Roche license agreement will expire on the date of the expiration of all payment obligations of both parties under the agreement. Upon expiration of the Roche license agreement, all licenses granted to each party that were in effect immediately prior to such expiration will be retained on a nonexclusive, fully paid, royalty-free basis. The Roche Entities may terminate the Roche license agreement either on a program-by-program basis for certain programs or in its entirety, for any reason or no reason upon 90 days’ written notice. In the event of the Roche Entities’ unilateral termination of the Roche license agreement without cause, all licenses and other rights granted by the Roche Entities to Biotie will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. Biotie may also terminate the Roche license agreement either on a program-by-program basis for certain of the programs or in its entirety, for any reason or no reason upon 90 days’ written notice. In the event of Biotie’s unilateral termination without cause, all licenses granted to Biotie with respect to the compounds and products in the terminated program (or, in the case of termination of the entire agreement, all compounds and products) will terminate. Either party may terminate the Roche license agreement for cause in the event of a breach by the other party of any material provision of the agreement if such breach has continued for 60 days after notice was provided (or a reasonably longer time if a party is diligently pursuing cure of a breach that was not susceptible of cure within the 60 day notice period). In the case of agreement disputes, specified officers must attempt resolution, and if no resolution is achieved, the matter may be referred to binding arbitration for final settlement as the exclusive forum for dispute resolution except for certain matters relating to patents and other intellectual property rights.
 UCB Termination and Transition Agreement (Tozadenant)
 Our Biotie subsidiary was previously a party to a collaboration agreement with UCB Biopharma S.P.R.L. relating to the development and commercialization of tozadenant. In 2014, Biotie and UCB entered into a termination and transition 
 22


agreement pursuant to which UCB’s participation in tozadenant development and commercialization was terminated. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, as terminated by the termination and transition agreement, Biotie received a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license to any blocking patents controlled by UCB as of the date of termination of the collaboration agreement in 2014, that would be infringed by the further development or exploitation of tozadenant products, solely to the extent necessary to develop and commercialize tozadenant products in the form described in UCB’s regulatory filings.
 Pursuant to the UCB termination and transition agreement, UCB also granted to Biotie an undivided, one-half ownership interest in all know-how related to tozadenant jointly developed by Biotie and UCB under the UCB collaboration agreement, as well as a worldwide, royalty-free license under UCB’s intellectual property rights in certain product data and regulatory documentation to use and reference the same for the purposes of exploiting tozadenant. UCB reserved the right to use such product data and regulatory documentation, subject to certain limitations. UCB provided Biotie with certain development funding under the UCB termination and transition agreement, and Biotie is obligated to repay such funding out of any future income Biotie receives from tozadenant. Biotie and UCB each agreed to release the other party from all claims arising out of the other party’s development activities with respect to tozadenant prior to the date of the termination and transition agreement, as well as UCB’s exploitation of tozadenant prior to that date. Biotie also agreed to indemnify UCB against any losses in connection with third-party claims arising from the continued exploitation of tozadenant by Biotie or its licensees.
 Other License Agreements
 In addition to the material license and collaboration agreements described above, we have entered into numerous other license agreements to support our research and development programs. These other license agreements include the following:

• | We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Canadian Spinal Research Organization for specified patents and know-how relating to the use of dalfampridine in the reduction of chronic pain and spasticity in a spinal cord injured subject.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23


Our Neuronex, Inc. subsidiary is a party to a license agreement with SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., relating to Plumiaz, a proprietary nasal spray formulation of diazepam that we were developing as a treatment for certain epilepsy patients. In 2016 we announced that we were discontinuing our Plumiaz development program.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 Ampyra
 We are party to a September 2003 agreement with Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’s 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) for our clinical and commercial supply of Ampyra. Under that agreement, we are required to purchase at least 75% of our annual commercial requirements of Ampyra from Alkermes unless Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements. In addition, the agreement also obligates us to make compensatory payments if we do not purchase 100% of our requirements from Alkermes.
 As permitted by our agreement with Alkermes, we have designated Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturing source of Ampyra. In connection with that designation, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon, and Alkermes assisted us in transferring manufacturing technology to Patheon. We and Alkermes have agreed that we may purchase up to 25% of our annual requirements from Patheon if we make compensatory payments to Alkermes. In addition, Patheon may supply us with Ampyra if Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.
 Under a Consent Agreement among Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’s acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business), Biogen and us, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of our rights under our agreements with Alkermes to Biogen. The three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under these agreements with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors, permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities, and requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 Regis Technologies, Inc. is the sole supplier of 4-aminopyridine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ampyra. If Regis experiences any disruption in their operations, a delay or interruption in the supply of our Ampyra product could result until Regis cures the problem or we locate an alternate source of supply. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements on terms that are commercially favorable, if at all. Any new supplier would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. We could experience substantial delays before we are able to qualify any new supplier.
 Once-Daily (QD) Formulation of Dalfampridine
 We have been exploring a once-daily (QD) formulation of dalfampridine for use in our post-stroke walking difficulties, or PSWD, clinical program. In November 2016, we announced we were discontinuing our PSWD program. As part of this development program, we conducted Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies on prototypes and these studies confirmed we have a potentially viable QD formulation of dalfampridine. 
 We have granted Alkermes plc a right of first refusal to be our primary commercial supplier of the initial QD formulation. Should we complete development of and receive FDA approval for a QD formulation, we may owe royalties on sales of the product to the development company under our agreement with them. In such event, we would also owe royalties to Alkermes on sales of the product under our existing agreements with Alkermes.
 CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology
 Our 2014 acquisition of Civitas included its 90,000 square foot subleased manufacturing facility located in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The facility was built specifically for the commercial-scale manufacture of ARCUS products. Prior to Civitas’s acquisition of this facility from Alkermes, the facility produced more than 36 million human doses of ARCUS-based products for use in clinical trials by Alkermes’s collaborator in indications other than Parkinson’s disease. Civitas subsequently took steps to recommission the facility, which has been certified by the EU regulatory authority (known as the Qualified Person, or QP, audit). Civitas produced current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP-quality human doses of CVT-301 for Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. As we are already at commercial scale, we believe that this will 
 24


support rapid commercialization should we receive marketing approval from the FDA. However, if we obtain approval from the FDA, we anticipate the need to expand our manufacturing operations at the Chelsea facility after product launch to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. The ARCUS dry powder aerosol particles are generated by applying our proprietary and multi-step spray drying process to active pharmaceutical ingredient. The application of spray drying in the pharmaceutical industry is highly specialized, and the process of manufacturing ARCUS particles requires significant expertise in dry powder manufacture and handling and capsule filling.
 We have developed mature quality systems to support commercial production. As described above, we have manufactured drug product at research and development scale and we believe that we have the expertise to transfer to large, commercial scale while maintaining all relevant drug product attributes. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to ensure reliable production that meets the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
 All CVT-301 dry powder inventory has been manufactured in-house using our cGMP process. Current data supports CVT-301 as a room temperature stable product. We have finalized drug formulation and fill weight and have also implemented final design changes for the inhaler, for which commercial molds have been produced. All raw materials used for CVT-301 manufacture are standard in pharmaceutical production. Our manufacturing team is led by individuals who are highly experienced with manufacturing of ARCUS products and other commercial products. Many of the individuals who lead our manufacturing previously manufactured ARCUS products at this facility for Alkermes.
 Our proprietary inhalers are manufactured by contract manufacturers using standard manufacturing processes. We own the molds and design history files for the inhalers. The inhalers are shipped fully assembled to us. Final design changes for the inhaler for our Phase 3 clinical trials and anticipated commercial launch have been implemented, and the molds have been produced.
 Cimaglermin alfa
 We contracted with CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc. in 2008 to produce and purify cimaglermin bulk material under cGMPs. Acorda and CMC Biologics have jointly developed analytical and characterization assays to support the manufacture of cimaglermin. The details of the manufacturing and purification processes and data from the analytical assays were provided to FDA in an IND application in March 2010. This drug substance was generated to support Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, safety and toxicology and to support drug product manufacturing.
 The final drug product for cimaglermin for clinical studies was produced at Althea Technologies, now Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., under a Product Development and Clinical Supply Agreement signed in 2009, using material produced by CMC Biologics described above. The filling process and testing of the filled product was submitted to FDA as part of an IND application that was originally filed in March 2010.
 rHIgM22
 We contracted with BioVest International, now Cell Culture Company, and CMC Biologics in 2009 for production and purification, respectively, of rHIgM22. All manufacturing was performed under cGMPs. Acorda and CMC Biologics developed analytical methods and characterization assays to support manufacturing and stability testing of the drug substance. A pilot lot of drug substance was tested in GLP studies for safety and toxicology.
 The final drug product for rHIgM22 for clinical studies was produced at Althea Technologies, now Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., using material produced by CMC Biologics as described above. The manufacturing process for drug substance and drug product, along with initial stability data for both, was submitted to FDA as part of an IND application originally filed in August 2012. 
 Other Products in Development
 We have established the internal capability to manufacture research quantities of antibody and protein product candidates.

Throughout this report, we may refer to any and all such intellectual property, and the corresponding research and development programs as, “our” or “Acorda’s” programs.
 Ampyra/aminopyridines
 We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, as follows:
  
• | The first is U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Based on the final patent term adjustment calculation of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, this patent will extend into 2027.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second is U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938, the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease, such as MS, and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation, such as AMPYRA (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg for improving walking in people with MS. In April 2013, the patent received a five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With a five year patent term extension, this patent will expire in 2018. We have an exclusive license to this patent from Alkermes (originally with Elan, but transferred to Alkermes as part of its acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The third is U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437, which includes claims relating to methods to improve walking, increase walking speed, and treat walking disability in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2026.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The fourth is U.S. Patent No. 8,440,703, which includes claims directed to methods of improving lower extremity function and walking and increasing walking speed in patients with MS by administering less than 15 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. This patent is set to expire in 2025.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The fifth is U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685 with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily. Absent patent term adjustment, the patent is set to expire in 2025.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers, who have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Amypra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they have also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016 and we are waiting for the Court’s decision. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of these four generic companies. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are also subject to inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These IPR petitions challenge four of the five Orange Book-listed patents. The USPTO held an oral argument regarding the IPR petitions on January 19, 2017, and a ruling on the IPR petitions is expected in March 2017. An adverse outcome in either of these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange Book-listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. 
 In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm 
 26


Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. On February 24, 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 CVT-301, CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology
 The intellectual property portfolio that we acquired with Civitas has over 100 issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to CVT-301 and the ARCUS drug delivery technology. This includes over 15 issued U.S. patents relating to CVT-301 directed to compositions of the drug product, the inhaler, methods of delivery of L-dopa, and manufacturing processes. The latest of the issued patents expires in 2032. The CVT-427 program, which also utilizes the ARCUS drug delivery technology, has pending applications directed to formulations, which, if granted would expire in 2036 absent any patent term adjustment.
 Tozadenant
 The tozadenant patent portfolio includes both Roche and Biotie owned patent families. The portfolio exclusively licensed from Roche includes two granted U.S. patents set to expire in 2021 and 2025, with claims directed to compositions of matter. The U.S. Patent set to expire in 2025 has foreign counterparts including a granted European patent with claims directed to composition of matter and methods of use. This European patent is also set to expire in 2025. The Biotie owned patent family includes pending U.S. and European patent applications with claims directed to method of use which, if granted would expire in 2030 and 2031 respectively. The Biotie owned patent family also includes pending and granted counterparts in other countries.
 SYN120
 We
 have an exclusive license from Roche for patents and patent applications relating to SYN120. This includes four granted U.S. patents set to expire in 2025 and 2026. The license also includes foreign counterparts, including two granted European patents, set to expire in 2025. The claims are directed to compositions of matter and methods of use.
 BTT1023
 The BTT1023 portfolio includes two patent families. The first family is owned by Biotie and includes two granted U.S. patents set to expire in 2028 and foreign counterparts including a granted European patent  set to expire in 2028. The claims are directed to composition of matter and methods of use. The second family is co-owned by Biotie with the University of Birmingham and includes pending U.S. and European patent applications which, if granted, would expire in 2030. This family also includes pending and granted counterparts in other countries. The claims of this family are directed to use of VAP-1 inhibitors for treatment of fibrotic conditions. The University of Birmingham has licensed their rights in this patent family back to Biotie.
 Remyelinating Antibodies/Antibodies Related to Nervous System Disorders
 Acorda is the exclusive licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to a series of remyelinating antibodies and their use discovered by scientists at the Mayo Clinic. This portfolio also includes granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to additional antibodies and their use. With regard to remyelinating antibodies, the portfolio includes granted European patents as well as other granted foreign counterparts.
 Cimaglermin alfa/Neuregulins
 We are the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals, plc), of its worldwide portfolio of patents, patent applications and IP rights related to products of neuregulin genes, including cimaglermin alfa. Collectively, these patents claim the use of particular neuregulins to treat various pathophysiological 
 27


conditions, particularly uses to stimulate myelinating cells in order to treat conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that involve demyelination. These patents also claim a number of additional potential uses of neuregulins, including stimulation of growth in cardiac and mammalian muscle cells, as well as treating cardiac failure, ischemic brain events, peripheral neuropathy and nerve injury.
 Our neuregulin portfolio includes a granted U.S. patent directed to using specified neuregulin sequences to treat congestive heart failure.
 Chondroitinase
 Our chondroitinase portfolio includes granted U.S. patents and granted foreign patent counterparts, as well as pending patent applications. The granted U.S. patents are directed to methods of using certain chondroitinase enzymes, including chondroitinase ABC-I, to reduce inflammation in patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases, spinal cord injury (SCI) or MS and certain chondroitinase ABC-I mutant enzymes and related methods of use. The pending U.S. patent applications and their foreign counterparts are directed to chondroitinase enzymes, methods of use and formulations thereof. In particular, we have pending U.S. applications and foreign equivalents relating to chondroitinase enzymes, including fusion proteins of chondroitinase enzymes, chimeric proteins including chondroitinase enzymes, deletion mutants of chondroitinase enzymes and certain methods of use of the same.
 In addition, we have a license from King's College and University of Cambridge to a pending U.S. application and its foreign counterparts directed to treatment of CNS damage.
 Qutenza and NP-1998/Topical Capsaicin Formulations 
 We have commercialization and development rights for Qutenza and NP-1998 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. In the U.S., we have one Orange Book-listed patent for Qutenza, which is U.S. Patent No. 6,239,180. An application for patent term extension (“PTE”) for this patent was filed on December 18, 2009 under the Hatch-Waxman law that allows for a patent to be extended for up to five additional years to compensate for regulatory delays stemming from the FDA approval process. We believe there is the potential for the patent to be extended to June 2021. We are waiting the FDAs final determination of the regulatory review period followed by the final determination from the USPTO confirming the length of the patent term extension and issuance of a patent term extension certificate from the USPTO. The original expiration date for Patent No. 6,239,180 was November 6, 2016. As the PTE request is still under review, we filed a request for an interim extension of time for this patent with the USPTO. The USPTO granted the request and the term of the patent is now extended to November 6, 2017. Securing further interim extensions is possible as we await issuance of the patent term extension certificate from the USPTO.
 There are granted U.S. patents which include claims directed to NP-1998 providing coverage until April 2027. There is also a pending U.S. patent application and pending foreign patent applications which, if granted, would expire in 2024.
 Trademarks
 In addition to patents, our intellectual property portfolio includes registered trademarks, along with pending trademark applications. We own several registered trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. These registered trademarks include, in the U.S., the marks “Acorda Therapeutics,” our stylized Acorda Therapeutics logo, “Biotie Therapies,” “Ampyra,” “Zanaflex,” “Zanaflex Capsules,” “Qutenza” and “ARCUS.”  We also have trademark registrations for “Fampyra” and “Kampyra” and pending trademark applications therefore, in numerous foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our trademark portfolio includes several trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for potential product names and for disease awareness activities.
Competition
 The market for developing and marketing pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. We are aware of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are engaged in development and/or marketing of therapeutics for a broad range of central nervous system conditions, including multiple sclerosis, or MS, Parkinson’s disease, or PD, and migraine. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, human and other resources than we 
 28


do. Furthermore, many of these companies have significantly more experience than we do in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, regulatory approval procedures and sales and marketing.
 Ampyra/MS  
 Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbieVie, and Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG.
 To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product that is approved as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. We are aware that Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing ADS-5102 (amantadine hydrochloride) in patients with MS who have walking impairment, which may compete with Ampyra. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a 3,4-diaminopyridine product, licensed from Biomarin, that also may compete with Ampyra.
 In certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS, and we expect that some people will continue to do this.
 Several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete with Ampyra or our preclinical candidates in the future.
 We believe that Ampyra is complementary to both the relapse management and disease course management therapies that are commercially available. Nonetheless, Ampyra may compete for market acceptance with these current treatments because they have been accepted and regularly prescribed to people with MS by physicians, or because physicians may think that these products also improve walking or other neurological functions.
 Ampyra could become subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are the subject of lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers, who have submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Amypra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers have challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they have also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016 and we are waiting for the Court’s decision. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of these four generic companies. Our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra are also subject to inter partes review (IPR) petitions filed by a hedge fund with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These IPR petitions challenge four of the five Orange Book-listed patents. The USPTO held an oral argument regarding the IPR petitions on January 19, 2017, and a ruling on the IPR petitions is expected in March 2017. An adverse outcome in either of these legal proceedings could result in our loss of some or all Orange Book-listed patents that we rely on for Ampyra. These legal proceedings are described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will need to devote significant resources to these legal proceedings, and if we are not successful our business could be materially harmed. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of these legal proceedings.

CVT-301/Parkinson’s Disease
 If approved for the treatment of OFF periods (re-emergence of symptoms), CVT-301 would compete against on-demand therapies that aim to specifically address Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Currently, Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is the only therapy approved for the treatment of OFF periods. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993. Also, Sunovian Pharmaceuticals Inc. is developing a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine. This program is in Phase 3 clinical development and could potentially be commercially launched ahead of CVT-301. 
 The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. CVT-301 may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Impax Laboratories has received FDA approval for RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being developed by others including Impax Depomed Inc., Intec Pharma and NeuroDerm Ltd. Also, Abbvie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.
 Tozadenant
 There is no cure or disease modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson’s disease. Available therapies fall into two categories, those that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods (re-emergence of symptoms) and other therapies for the on-demand treatment of OFF periods. If approved, tozadenant would be the first new class of drugs approved in the U.S. for improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease in over 20 years. Broadly, current therapies and those in development either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors, or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. We believe these therapies are  complementary, since tozadenant is positioned as an adjunct to levodopa-based regimens. However, we cannot predict how the improvement in existing or development of new therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease might affect demand for an adjunctive therapy such as tozadenant.
 If approved for the reduction of OFF time, Tozadenant would compete with other adjunctive therapies in late stage development. For example, Safinamide is being developed by Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.a as add-on therapy to treat mid-late stage Parkinson’s disease patients. We believe that Newron Pharmaceuticals could receive approval from the FDA for their NDA as early as March 2017. Also, Opicapone (BIA 9-1067) is a Parkinson’s disease therapy developed by BIAL currently approved in Europe and in Phase 1 development in the U.S. for use as adjunctive therapy in levodopa treated Parkinson’s disease patients. Istradefylline, another A2a antagonist therapy for Parkinson’s disease, being developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin, is approved in Japan, but future plans for this product in the U.S. market are unknown.
 Zanaflex/Spasticity
 Zanaflex Capsules and Zanaflex tablets contain tizanidine hydrochloride, one of the two leading active ingredients used for the management of spasticity, a symptom suffered by, among others, both MS and spinal cord injury patients. Tizanidine hydrochloride is approved by the FDA as a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. There are currently a number of generic version of both Zanaflex tablets and Zanaflex Capsules on the market, including our own authorized generic version of Zanaflex Capsules that we launched in 2012. Our net revenue from Zanaflex products, particularly Zanaflex Capsules,  has declined significantly due to competition from generic versions, and we expect it will continue to decline in 2017 and beyond.
 Qutenza/Post-Herpetic Neuralgia
 Qutenza faces significant competition from various other oral and topical products that are indicated to treat post-herpetic neuralgia and/or other forms of neuropathic pain, as well as other prescription and over the counter pain medications not specifically indicated for neuropathic pain that patients may use to address their symptoms. Many of the prescription pain medications that may compete with Qutenza are available in generic forms. If we successfully develop and commercialize NP-1998, this product would similarly face significant competition from these other products.
 30


Also, unlike our other products, Qutenza may be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting. For this reason, it is treated as a “buy-and-bill” product by most payers, including most Medicare programs, Medicaid programs, and private payers. Buy-and-bill products must be purchased by health care providers before they can be administered to patients. Health care providers subsequently must seek reimbursement for the product from the applicable third party payer such as Medicaid or a health insurance company. Health care providers may be reluctant to administer Qutenza because they would have to fund the purchase of the product and then seek reimbursement (which may differ somewhat from their purchase price), or because they do not want the additional administrative burden required for the product.
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Regulation of Drugs and Drug Product Approval 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical testing, clinical development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, sale, promotion, import and export of our products and product candidates.
 In the U.S., Ampyra, Zanaflex Capsules, Zanaflex tablets, Qutenza, and our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs. Some of our product candidates are potentially regulated both as drugs, drug/medical device combinations and as biological products. Drugs, biologics, and medical devices primarily are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA's and other health authorities' delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies or agencies of the states and localities in which our products are tested, manufactured, sold or distributed.
 The process required by the FDA under these laws before our drug and biological product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic, for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of whether each facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, containing preclinical and clinical data, proposed labeling, information to demonstrate that the product will be manufactured to appropriate standards, and other required information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its safety and potential efficacy. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND sponsor may initiate clinical trials 30 days after filing the IND application, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, charged with protecting the welfare of human subjects involved in research at each 
 31


medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical trial before it commences at that center. The IRB(s) must continue to monitor the trial until its completion. Many studies also employ a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, with experts who are otherwise independent of the conduct of the study and are given access to the unblinded study data periodically during the study to determine whether the study should be halted. For example, a DSMB might halt a study if an unacceptable safety issue emerges, or if the data showing the effectiveness of the study drug would make it unethical to continue giving patients placebo. Study subjects must provide informed consent before their participation in the research study.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially administered into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to confirm the clinical efficacy from Phase 2 and to further test for safety in an expanded population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as MS, the initial human testing is often conducted in affected patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target condition, these clinical trials may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these clinical trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials. 
 Before proceeding with a Phase 3 trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial, but the agreement does not guarantee FDA approval even if the SPA is followed. For example a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug could be identified after the testing has begun. In addition, even if an SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses, or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations. 
 Federal and state law requires the submission of registry and results information for most clinical trials to a publicly available database at www.clinicaltrials.gov. These requirements generally do not apply to Phase 1 clinical trials. 
 U.S. law requires that trials conducted to support approval for product marketing be "adequate and well controlled."  This entails a number of requirements, including that there is a clear statement of objects and methods in the protocol, the study design permits a valid comparison with a control (e.g., a placebo, another drug already approved for the studied condition, or a non-concurrent control such as historical data), and that the statistical methods used to analyze the data are adequate to assess the effects of the drug. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements.
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRBs or the DSMB may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold or terminate them at any point in this process if, among other reasons, they conclude that study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 In the U.S., for most drugs and biologics, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to marketing and commercial distribution of the product candidate. If the product candidate is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. If the product candidate, such as an antibody, is regulated as a biologic, a BLA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA or BLA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness (for a drug) and safety, purity and potency (for a biologic) of the compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling. 
 32


Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or BLA and must be registered with the FDA. The application will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug or biological product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. If the manufacturing facilities and processes fail to pass the FDA inspection, we will not receive approval to market these products, or approval may be delayed until the manufacturing issues are resolved. The FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites and/or the clinical sponsor for compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP. If the FDA determines that one or more of our clinical trials were not conducted in accordance with GCP, the agency may determine not to consider effectiveness data generated from such clinical trials in support of our applications for marketing approval.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing a BLA or NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees could be significant. 
 Once an NDA or BLA is submitted for FDA approval, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing if deemed complete, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs and BLAs: six months for priority applications and 10 months for regular applications, with two additional months added to each period for new molecular entities. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if favorable, often is not an actual approval but an “action letter” or “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. This additional work could include substantial additional clinical trials. The FDA's review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. 
 The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it will limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, may require that contraindications or warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional post-approval studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or may otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Under a REMS, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on distribution and use of a marketed product, may require the distribution of medication guides to patients and/or healthcare professionals or patient communication plans, and may impose a timetable for submission of assessments of the effectiveness of a REMS. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years or more and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time or permanently and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, labeling changes or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals would harm our business. Marketing our product candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Any products manufactured or distributed in the U.S. by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements relating to record-keeping, labeling, packaging, reporting of adverse experiences and other reporting, advertising and promotion, distribution, cGMPs, and import/export, as well as any other requirements imposed by the applicant’s NDA or BLA. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be truthful, fairly balanced and adequately substantiated, and that our labeling bears adequate directions for all intended uses of the product. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug, require post-approval studies or clinical trials, or impose a REMS post-approval if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes impacts the drug’s 
 33


safety profile. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Foreign drug manufacturers must comply with similar local requirements and may be subject to inspections by the FDA or local regulatory agencies. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with cGMPs and other regulatory requirements. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. 
 In addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations on FDA Form 483. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
 We and our product candidates are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where they are or will be marketed, or where we may have operations. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Federal law and some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including requirements for the development of systems capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Any applicable federal, state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.
 The FDA's policies may change and additional U.S. or foreign government laws and/or regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to obtain approval of our product candidates or market our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in government scrutiny or new regulations that could harm our business. For example, recent significant price increases by certain drug manufacturers have received considerable scrutiny from U.S. Congress, in some cases forcing those companies to dramatically reduce those prices.  We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. 
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplemental NDA or BLA for the orphan use. We received an orphan drug designation for Ampyra for the treatment of both MS and incomplete spinal cord injury. The number of people affected by MS now exceeds 200,000. However, this does not affect Ampyra’s orphan drug designation in the United States, as it was granted prior to the increase in prevalence above 200,000.
 Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, and reduced filing fees for marketing applications. If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another sponsor if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior or demonstrates a major contribution to patient care, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public's need. If the FDA approves another sponsor’s application for a drug that is the same as a drug with orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its approved use, including for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another 
 34


person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.
 Some other jurisdictions have orphan drug rules and offer similar incentives. In the EU, for example, a designated orphan drug benefits from free scientific advice and reduced application fees. Moreover, an approved orphan drug benefits from a 10-year exclusivity period, during which regulators can neither accept nor approve applications for similar medicinal products for the same indication, unless there are insufficient supplies of the approved orphan drug or the similar product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the approved orphan drug. Under the EU system, however, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, will reassess orphan status in parallel with the European Medicines Agency’s assessment of the marketing authorization application and the COMP can recommend that orphan status is removed if the product no longer meets the relevant criteria.
 Generic Drugs, AB Ratings and Pharmacy Substitution
 Generic drugs are approved through an abbreviated regulatory process, which differs in important ways from the process followed for innovative products. For generic versions of drugs subject to an NDA, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, is filed with the FDA. The ANDA must seek approval of a product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so-called "reference listed drug" that has already been approved pursuant to a full NDA. Only limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special suitability petition process. ANDA applicants are not required to submit clinical data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Instead, FDA relies on its findings of safety and effectiveness of the reference listed drug to approve the ANDA. As a result, the law requires the ANDA applicant submit only limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at a rate and extent consistent with that of the reference listed drug. This is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. It also must contain certifications with respect to all patents that are listed for the reference listed drug in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as the “Orange Book.” 
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, drugs that are new chemicals entities, or NCEs, are eligible for a five-year data exclusivity period. During this period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA submitted by another company that relies on any of the data submitted by the innovator company. This exclusivity period also applies to “505(b)(2)” applications, which are hybrid applications that rely in-part on pioneer data and in-part on new clinical data submitted to account for differences between the 505(b)(2) product and the reference listed drug. ANDA applicants and 505(b)(2) applicants must certify to all patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference listed drug (i.e., the innovator NDA). An ANDA (or 505(b)(2) application) may be submitted to FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of those listed patents. The statute also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA (or NDA supplement) that is not an NCE if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed essential to approval. During this period, the FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data that was submitted by the innovator company. Neither exclusivity period blocks the approval of full applications (i.e., full NDAs) submitted to the FDA because full NDAs do not rely on a pioneer’s data.
 Special procedures apply when an ANDA contains one or more certifications stating that a listed patent is invalid or not infringed. This is known as a “Paragraph IV” certification. If the owner of the patent or the NDA for the reference listed drug brings a patent infringement suit within a specified time after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, an automatic stay bars FDA approval of the ANDA for 30 months, which period may be extended under certain circumstances. The length of the automatic stay depends on whether the FDA classifies the reference listed drug as an NCE, as follows:
  
• | If the FDA does not classify the reference listed drug as an NCE, then the automatic stay is for 30 months from the date that the manufacturer of the reference listed drug receives the patent certification described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If the reference listed drug is classified by the FDA as an NCE, then the length of the automatic stay depends on when the ANDA is filed. No company can file an ANDA on a reference listed drug that the FDA has designated as an NCE until five years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval, except that an ANDA may be submitted four years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval if the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV patent certification. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed five or more years after FDA approval of the NCE, then the stay duration is 30 months. However, if an ANDA (with a Paragraph IV certification) is filed in between the fourth and fifth years after FDA approval of the NCE, the automatic 30 month stay is extended by a number of months equal to the number of months remaining in the fifth year after approval of the reference listed drug, providing a total of up to a 42 month stay.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 35


If the stay is either lifted or expires and the FDA approves the ANDA, the generic manufacturer may decide to begin selling its product even if patent litigation is pending. However, if the generic manufacturer launches before patent litigation is resolved, the launch is at the risk of the generic manufacturer being later held liable for patent infringement damages.
 Many states require or permit pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions unless the physician has prohibited substitution. Managed care organizations often urge physicians to prescribe drugs with generic equivalents, and to authorize substitution, as a means of controlling costs of prescriptions. They also may require lower copayments as an incentive to patients to ask for and accept generics. 
 While the question of substitutability is one of state law, most states look to the FDA to determine whether a generic is substitutable. The FDA lists therapeutic equivalence ratings in the “Orange Book.”  In general, a generic drug that is listed in the Orange Book as therapeutically equivalent to the branded product will be substitutable under state law and, conversely, a generic drug that is not so listed will not be substitutable. Drug products that the FDA considers to be therapeutically equivalent to other drug products receive one of various types of “A” ratings. For example, solid oral dosage form drug products that are considered therapeutically equivalent are generally rated “AB” in the Orange Book, while therapeutically equivalent solutions and powders for aerosolization generally receive an “AB” or an “AN” rating depending on how bioequivalence was demonstrated.
 To be considered therapeutically equivalent, a generic drug must first be a pharmaceutical equivalent of the branded drug. This means that the generic has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength or concentration and route of administration as the branded drug. Tablets and capsules are currently considered different dosage forms that are pharmaceutical alternatives and therefore are not substitutable pharmaceutical equivalents. In addition to being pharmaceutical equivalents, therapeutic equivalents must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts. Bioequivalence for this purpose is defined in the same manner as for ANDA approvals, and usually requires a showing of comparable rate and extent of absorption in a small human study.
 The process described above is not applicable to drugs where the pioneer product was approved pursuant to a BLA, rather than an NDA. A separate process exists for follow-on versions of such products and is discussed in the section entitled “Biosimilars,” below.
 Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices in the United States 
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, effectiveness, storage, record keeping, marketing, import, export, and distribution of medical devices. The level of regulation applied by the FDA generally depends on the class into which the medical device falls: Class I, II, or III. Class I medical devices present the lowest risk, and Class III medical devices present the highest risk. In general, the higher class of device, the greater the degree of regulatory control. All devices, for example, are subject to “General Controls,” which include: 

• | Establishment registration by manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers, and re-labelers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Device listing with FDA;
--+-------------------------


• | Good manufacturing practices;
--+------------------------------


• | Labeling regulations; and
--+--------------------------


• | Reporting of adverse events.
--+-----------------------------

 Class II medical devices are subject to General Controls, but also Special Controls, including special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, additional post market surveillance, and specific FDA guidance. Most Class III medical devices are assessed individually through an extensive Premarket Review application, or PMA. As a result, although they are subject to General Controls, they generally are not subject to Special Controls. Instead, most Class III devices have additional requirements and conditions of use imposed on them through the individualized PMA review and approval process. 
 Although we do not manufacture or market stand-alone medical devices, some of our product candidates rely on device components to deliver drug product to patients. In general, the FDA regulates such products as “combination products.”  The FDA assigns combination products for review by the drug or device center based on a determination of the product’s “primary mode of action.”  If the FDA determines that the product achieves its therapeutic effect through drug component, it will be assigned to the Center for Drugs (CDER) or the Center for Biologics (CBER) for review and approval.

By contrast, if the FDA determines that the device component is the primary mode of action, then the product will be reviewed and approved by the center for devices (CDRH). We anticipate that to the extent that any of our pipeline products are regulated as combination products, the FDA likely will find that the primary mode of action is through the drug component, and therefore the product will be reviewed by CDER. In that case, however, CDER/CBER will consult with CDRH on the drug component and we will still have to comply with certain requirements applicable to medical devices. 
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA premarket review or approval. With some exceptions, Class II devices may be marketed only if the FDA “clears” the medical device through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is “substantially equivalent” to certain devices already on the market. Again with some exceptions, Class III devices are approved through a PMA, which generally requires an applicant to submit data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. Clinical data are sometimes required for a 510(k) application as well. Manufacturers conducting clinical trials with medical devices are subject to similar requirements as those conducting clinical trials with drugs or biologics. For example, a manufacturer must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to test a significant risk device in humans, must comply with GCPs, and must obtain IRB approval. 
 The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. For example, medical devices are subject to detailed manufacturing standards under the FDA’s quality systems regulations, or QSRs, and specific rules regarding labeling and promotion. Medical device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their products with the FDA. 
 States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors, including registration and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable federal and state medical device requirements could result in, among other things, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or clearance, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or other civil or criminal penalties.
 Biosimilars
 The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the FDA to approve “biosimilars” (follow-on versions of pioneer products approved pursuant to a BLA) via a separate, abbreviated pathway. Under this abbreviated pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is “highly similar” to the “reference product,” and that there are no “clinically meaningful differences” between the biosimilar and the reference product. Unlike ANDAs, biosimilars are not, in general, automatically substitutable for the reference product at the pharmacy. Instead, the FDA must make a separate finding of “interchangeability.”  To date, the trend in state law has been to permit or require substitution only of those biosimilars that have also been deemed by the FDA to be interchangeable.
 The Affordable Care Act also established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity against biosimilars for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the BLA-holders’s regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the reference product’s data in its approved BLA. In contrast to the provisions for NDAs, the biologics data exclusivity provisions do not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products, or otherwise create an “automatic stay” of FDA approval of a biosimilar. If our product candidates are approved as biologics, they may face significant competition from biosimilars in the future.
 Foreign Regulation and Product Approval
 Outside the U.S., our ability or the ability of our collaborator Biogen to market a product candidate is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Foreign marketing authorizations can be applied for at a national level, although within the European Union, or EU, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in the entire European Economic Area, or EEA (through the “centralized procedure,” which is mandatory for certain products, including biotechnology and advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicines and new active substances for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases), or in more than one individual EU member state (through the “mutual recognition procedure” or “decentralized procedure”). The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above.

Other Regulations
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products, as well as medical devices, are potentially subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and state and local governments. For example, controlled substances that are scheduled by the DEA are subject to additional regulatory requirements including, among other things, special security and handling requirements, and potential restrictions on distribution, sales, marketing. For example, sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs and other Acorda interactions with healthcare professionals, must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and may be affected by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and/or the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, or DOD, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, under legislative changes made in 2009, discounted prices must also be offered for certain DOD purchases for its TRICARE retail pharmacy program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal reporting requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under these requirements are placed on a public database. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS annually. Similarly, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to annually report to FDA samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these sample disclosures will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any additional guidance as to how the data will be used.
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among other matters, those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances; the exposure of persons to hazardous substances; the release of pollutants into the air and bodies of water; and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Our research and development and manufacturing activities and the activities of our third-party manufacturers involve the use of hazardous substances, and the risk of injury, contamination or noncompliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements cannot be eliminated. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Although compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent legal or regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us.
 Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
 In many of the markets where we or Biogen, our collaborator for Ampyra, would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls, by law, and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. 
 In the U.S., there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public healthcare 
 38


programs such as Medicaid. Various states have adopted further mechanisms under Medicaid and other programs that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products. Recent heightened scrutiny of the prices of several drug products have led to numerous other proposals, at both the federal and state level, to address perceived issues related to drug pricing. 
 Under the reimbursement methodology set forth in the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, physicians are reimbursed for drugs they administer to Medicare beneficiaries based on a product's "average sales price," or ASP. This ASP-based reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels. The MMA also established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The ACA requires drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.”
 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price are reported to the government and the formula for calculating required Medicaid rebates. The ACA increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the ACA increased the additional Medicaid rebate on “line extensions” (such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of AMP by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the entities eligible for discounted 340B pricing.
 The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer’s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The ACA also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research for use in the healthcare industry, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that will affect existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. 
 The new Administration and the majority party in both Houses of the U.S. Congress have indicated their desire to repeal the ACA. It is unclear whether, when and how that repeal will be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector will be. Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
 Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private healthcare payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, for example, there is extensive regulation of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement through health systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement based on the results of health economic assessments. Others control the price of pharmaceutical products through reference pricing approaches where the reimbursement price is determined by the price in other jurisdictions. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
