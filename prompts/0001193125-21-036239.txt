ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Business Overview 
 We are a global pharmaceutical company, committed to helping patients around the world to access affordable medicines and benefit from innovations to improve their health. Our mission is to be a global leader in generics, specialty medicines and biopharmaceuticals, improving the lives of patients. 
 We operate worldwide, with headquarters in Israel and a significant presence in the United States, Europe and many other markets around the world. Our key strengths include our world-leading generic medicines expertise and portfolio, focused specialty medicines portfolio and global infrastructure and scale. 
 Teva was incorporated in Israel on February 13, 1944 and is the successor to a number of Israeli corporations, the oldest of which was established in 1901. 
 Our Business Segments 
 We operate our business through three segments: North America, Europe and International Markets. Each business segment manages our entire product portfolio in its region, including generics, specialty and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products. This structure enables strong alignment and integration between operations, commercial regions, R&D and our global marketing and portfolio function, optimizing our product lifecycle across therapeutic areas. 
 In addition to these three segments, we have other activities, primarily the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis.

  For information regarding our major customers, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Below is an overview of our three business segments. 
 North America 
 Our North America segment includes the United States and Canada. 
 We are the leading generic pharmaceutical company in the United States. We market over 500 generic prescription products in more than 1,500 dosage strengths, packaging sizes and forms, including oral solid dosage forms, injectable products, inhaled products, liquids, ointments and creams. Most of our generic sales in the United States are made to retail drug chains, mail order distributors and wholesalers. 
 Our wholesale and retail selling efforts are supported by participation in key pharmaceutical conferences as well as focused advertising in professional journals and on leading pharmacy websites. We continue to strengthen consumer awareness of the benefits of generic medicines through partnerships and digital marketing programs. 
 Our specialty portfolio in North America focuses on three main areas: central nervous system (“CNS”) and pain, respiratory and oncology. 
 Our CNS portfolio includes AJOVY® for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, AUSTEDO® for the treatment of neurodegenerative and movement disorders – chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia and COPAXONE®, which is still among the leading products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (“MS”) in North America since it launched nearly 25 years ago. 
 We are committed to maintaining a leading presence in the respiratory market by delivering a range of medicines for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), including ProAir®, QVAR® and our newly launched digital inhaler portfolio. 
 We maintain a meaningful presence in oncology medicines, including both specialty and generic medicines (including biosimilars). In 2019, we launched TRUXIMA®, our first oncology biosimilar product in the United States. BENDEKA® is a liquid, low-volume (50 mL) and short-time 10-minute infusion formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride that we licensed from Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eagle”). 
 Anda, our distribution business in the United States, distributes generic, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from various third party manufacturers to independent retail pharmacies, pharmacy retail chains, hospitals and physician offices in the United States. Anda is able to compete in the secondary distribution market by maintaining high inventory levels for a broad offering of products, competitive pricing and offering next day delivery throughout the United States. 
 Europe 
 Our Europe segment includes the European Union and certain other European countries. 
 We are the leading generic pharmaceutical company in Europe. We are among the top three generic pharmaceutical companies in a number of European Union markets, including some of the largest markets in the European Union. No single country in Europe represents more than 25% of our total European generic revenues, and therefore we are not highly dependent on any single country that could be affected by pricing reforms or changes in regulations and public policy. 
 Despite their diversity and highly fragmented nature, the European markets share many characteristics that allow us to leverage our pan-European presence and broad portfolio. Global customers are important partners in 
 
3 

  our generic business and are expanding across Europe, although customer consolidation is lower than in the United States. We are one of a few generic pharmaceutical companies with a pan-European footprint. Most competitors focus on a select few markets or business lines. 
 Our OTC portfolio in Europe includes global brands such as SUDOCREM® as well as local and regional brands such as NasenDuo® in Germany and Flegamina® in Poland. 
 Our specialty portfolio in Europe focuses on three main areas: CNS and pain (including migraine), respiratory and oncology. Our leading product, COPAXONE, continues to be among the leading products for the treatment of MS, though new treatments are being introduced to various markets in the European Union. AJOVY was granted EU marketing authorization in 2019 and, as of December 31, 2020, we have launched AJOVY in most European countries. 
 International Markets 
 Our International Markets segment includes all countries in which we operate other than those in our North America and Europe segments. These markets comprise more than 35 countries, covering a substantial portion of the global pharmaceutical market. 
 Our key international markets are Japan, Russia and Israel. In Japan, we operate a majority of our business through a business venture with Takeda Pharmaceutical Companies Limited (“Takeda”), in which we own a 51% stake and Takeda owns the remaining 49%. On February 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the majority of the generic and operational assets of our business venture in Japan. Countries in our International Markets segment include highly regulated, pure generic markets, such as Israel, branded generics oriented markets, such as Russia and certain Latin America markets, and hybrid markets, such as Japan. Each market’s strategy is built upon differentiation and filling the unmet needs of that market. Our integrated sales force enables us to extract synergies across our branded generic, OTC and specialty medicines product offerings and across various channels (e.g., retail, institutional). 
 Our specialty portfolio in our International Markets segment focuses on three main areas: CNS and pain, respiratory and oncology. 
 Our Product Portfolio and Business Offering 
 Our product and service portfolio includes generic medicines, biopharmaceuticals, specialty medicines, OTC products, a distribution business, API and contract manufacturing. Each region manages the entire range of products and services offered in its region and our global marketing and portfolio function optimizes our pipeline and product lifecycle across therapeutic areas. In most markets in which we operate, we use an integrated and comprehensive marketing model, offering a broad portfolio of products, including specialty, generic and OTC products. 
Generic Medicines 
 Generic medicines are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the originator’s products. Generics are required to meet similar governmental requirements as their brand-name equivalents, such as those relating to manufacturing processes and health authorities’ inspections, and must receive regulatory approval prior to their sale in any given country. Generic medicines may be manufactured and marketed if relevant patents on their brand-name equivalents (and any additional government-mandated market exclusivity periods) have expired or have been challenged or otherwise circumvented. 
 We develop, manufacture and sell generic medicines in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams. We offer a broad range of basic chemical entities, 
 
4 

  as well as specialized product families, such as sterile products, hormones, high-potency drugs and cytotoxic substances, in both parenteral and solid dosage forms. 
 Our generics business has a wide-reaching commercial presence. We are the leading generic pharmaceutical company in the United States and have a top three leadership position in many countries, including some of the key European markets. We have a robust product portfolio, comprehensive R&D capabilities and product pipeline and a global operational network, which enables us to execute key generic launches to further expand our product pipeline and diversify our revenue stream. We use these capabilities to help overcome price erosion in our generics business. 
 When considering whether to develop a generic medicine, we take into account a number of factors, including our overall strategy, regional and local patient and customer needs, R&D and manufacturing capabilities, regulatory considerations, commercial factors and the intellectual property landscape. We will challenge patents when appropriate if we believe they are either invalid or would not be infringed by our generic version. We may seek alliances to acquire rights to products we do not have in our portfolio, to share development costs or litigation risks, or to resolve patent and regulatory barriers to entry. 
 Between 2017 and 2019, we substantially optimized our global generics portfolio, particularly in the United States, through product discontinuation and price adjustments, with a focus on increasing profitability. This resulted in the restructuring and optimization of our manufacturing and supply network, including the closure or divestment of a significant number of manufacturing plants around the world. We are continuing our ongoing efforts to consolidate our manufacturing and supply network. 
 In markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel, generic medicines may be substituted by the pharmacist for their brand name equivalent or prescribed by International Nonproprietary Name (“INN”). In these so-called “pure generic” markets, physicians and patients have little control over the choice of generic manufacturer, and consequently generic medicines are not actively marketed or promoted to physicians or consumers. Instead, the relationship between the manufacturer and pharmacy chains and distributors, health funds and other health insurers is critical. Many of these markets have automatic substitution models when generics are available as alternatives to brands. In Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and certain Latin American and European countries, generic medicines are generally sold under brand names alongside the originator brand. These markets are referred to as “branded generic” markets and are generally “out of pocket” markets in which consumers can pay for a particular branded generic medicine (as opposed to government or privately funded medical health insurance), often at the recommendation of their physician. Branded generic products are actively promoted and a sales force is necessary to create and maintain brand awareness. Other markets, such as Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Spain, are hybrid markets with elements of both approaches. 
 Our position in the generics market is supported by our global R&D function, as well as our API R&D and manufacturing activities, which provide significant vertical integration for our products. 
 For information about our product launches and pipeline of generic medicines in North America and Europe, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Information—North America Segment” and “Item 7—Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Information—Europe Segment.” 
 Biologic medicines are large and complex medicines produced by or made from living cells or organisms, often produced using cutting-edge biotechnological methods. Biosimilars are highly similar to the reference biologic, in both structure and function (e.g., pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy and immunogenicity) and, for any approved uses, have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. 
 
5 

  In November 2019 and February 2020, we launched TRUXIMA® (rituximab-abbs), a biosimilar to Rituxan® (rituximab), in the United States and in Canada, respectively. It is our first oncology biosimilar product in the United States and is the first rituximab biosimilar to be approved in the United States. 
 In January 2020 and March 2020, we launched HERZUMA® (trastuzumab-pkrb), a biosimilar to Herceptin® (trastuzumab), in Canada and the United States, respectively. 
 In November 2020, a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) was accepted for review by the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for a proposed biosimilar to Humira® (adalimumab) that is under development by Alvotech. For further information regarding our partnership with Alvotech, see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Alvotech Partnership.” 
 We have additional biosimilar products in development in various stages of clinical trials and regulatory review. 
 Specialty Medicines 
 Our specialty medicines business, which is focused on delivering innovative solutions to patients and providers via medicines, devices and services in key regions and markets around the world, includes our core therapeutic areas of CNS (with a strong emphasis on MS, neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychiatry, movement disorders and pain care including migraine) and respiratory medicines (with a focus on asthma and COPD). We also have specialty products in oncology and selected other areas. 
 We deploy medical and sales and marketing professionals within specific therapeutic areas who seek to address the needs of patients and healthcare professionals. We tailor our patient support, payer relations and medical affairs activities to the distinct characteristics of each therapeutic area and medicine. 
 The U.S. market is the most significant market in our specialty business. In Europe and International Markets, we leverage existing synergies between our specialty business and our generics and OTC businesses. Our specialty presence in International Markets is mainly built on our CNS, pain, respiratory and oncology medicines. 
 We have built specialized “Patient Support Programs” to help patients adhere to their treatments, improve patient outcomes and, in certain markets, to ensure timely delivery of medicines and assist in securing reimbursement. These programs reflect the importance we place on supporting patients and ensuring better medical outcomes for them. Patient Support Programs are currently operated in many countries around the world in multiple therapeutic areas. We believe that it is important to provide a range of services and solutions tailored to meet the needs of patients according to their specific condition and local market requirements. We believe this capability provides an important competitive advantage in the specialty medicines market. 
 Below is a description of our key specialty products: 
 CNS (including Movement Disorders, Pain and Migraine) 
 Our CNS and pain portfolio includes AUSTEDO for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington disease, AJOVY for the preventive treatment of migraine and COPAXONE for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. 
 AUSTEDO 
 

• | AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine) is a deuterated form of a small molecule inhibitor of vesicular monoamine 2 transporter, or VMAT2, that is designed to regulate the levels of a specific
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6 

  
neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the brain. The FDA granted Deutetrabenazine New Chemical Entity exclusivity until April 2022 and Orphan Drug exclusivity for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease until April 2024.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AUSTEDO was launched in the U.S. in 2017. It is indicated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults, which is a debilitating, often irreversible movement disorder caused by certain medications used to treat mental health or gastrointestinal conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AUSTEDO launched in China for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in early 2021. We continue with additional submissions in various other countries around the world.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AUSTEDO is protected in the United States by five Orange Book patents expiring between 2031 and 2033 and in Europe by two patents expiring in 2029. The first date for expected generic ANDA filings on AUSTEDO is in April 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AJOVY 
 

• | AJOVY (fremanezumab-vfrm) injection is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) and it is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. AJOVY was launched in the U.S. in 2018. AJOVY was approved in Canada in April 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During 2019, AJOVY was granted a marketing authorization in the European Union by the EMA in a centralized process and began receiving marketing authorizations in various countries in our International Markets segment. By the end of 2020, we launched AJOVY in most European countries and in certain International Markets countries. We are moving forward with plans to launch in other countries around the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On January 27, 2020, the FDA approved an auto-injector device for AJOVY in the U.S., which became commercially available in April 2020. We have also received approval from the EMA for AJOVY’s auto-injector submission in the EU in October 2019, and we commenced launch in March 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AJOVY is protected by patents expiring in 2026 in Europe and in 2027 in the United States. Applications for patent term extensions have been submitted in various markets around the world, and certain extensions in Europe and other countries have already been granted until 2031. Additional patents relating to the use of AJOVY in the treatment of migraine have also been issued in the United States and will expire in 2035 and 2037. Such patents are also pending in other countries. AJOVY will also be protected by regulatory exclusivity of 12 years from marketing approval in the United States and 10 years from marketing approval in Europe.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Eli Lilly & Co.’s (“Lilly”) marketing and sale of its galcanezumab product for the treatment of migraine infringes nine Teva patents. Lilly then submitted IPR (inter partes review) petitions to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, challenging the validity of the nine patents asserted against it in the litigation. The litigation in the district court was stayed pending resolution of the IPR petitions. On February 18, 2020, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued decisions on the first six IPRs, finding the six composition of matter patents invalid as being obvious. On April 21, 2020, we filed notices of appeal in connection with these decisions. On March 31, 2020 the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a decision upholding the three method of treatment patents and, on June 1, 2020, Lilly filed notices of appeal in connection with the decisions on these three patents. The litigation stay ended following the issuance of the most recent IPR decisions, and the parties are proceeding with the litigation. In addition, in 2018 we entered into separate agreements with Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lilly, resolving the European Patent Office oppositions that they filed against our AJOVY patents. The settlement agreement with Lilly also resolved Lilly’s action to revoke the patent protecting AJOVY in the United Kingdom.

7 

  COPAXONE 
 

• | COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) is one of the leading MS therapies in the United States (according to IQVIA data as of late 2020). COPAXONE is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS (“RMS”), including the reduction of the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (“RRMS”), including in patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COPAXONE is believed to have a unique mechanism of action that works with the immune system, unlike many therapies that are believed to rely on general immune suppression or cell sequestration to exert their effect. COPAXONE provides a proven mix of efficacy, safety and tolerability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One European patent protecting COPAXONE 40 mg/mL was found invalid by the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office in September 2020. Two additional patents expiring in 2030 are currently under opposition at the European Patent Office. In certain countries, Teva remains in litigation against generic companies on an additional COPAXONE 40 mg/mL patent that expires in 2030.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The market for MS treatments continues to develop, particularly with the approval of generic versions of COPAXONE. Oral treatments for MS, such as Tecfidera®, Gilenya® and Aubagio®, continue to present significant and increasing competition. COPAXONE also continues to face competition from existing injectable products, as well as from monoclonal antibodies, such as Ocrevus®.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oncology 
 Our specialty oncology portfolio includes BENDEKA / TREANDA®, GRANIX® and TRISENOX® in the United States and LONQUEX®, TEVAGRASTIM®/RATIOGRASTIM® and TRISENOX® outside the United States. 
 BENDEKA and TREANDA 
 

• | BENDEKA (bendamustine hydrochloride) injection and TREANDA (bendamustine hydrochloride) for injection are approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (“CLL”) and patients with indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (“NHL”) that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. We launched BENDEKA in the United States in January 2016. It is a liquid, low-volume (50 mL) and short-time 10-minute infusion formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride that we licensed from Eagle.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BENDEKA faces direct competition from Belrapzo® (a ready-to-dilute bendamustine hydrochloride product from Eagle). Other competitors to BENDEKA include combination therapies such as R-CHOP (a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone in combination with rituximab) and CVP-R (a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone in combination with rituximab) for the treatment of NHL, as well as a combination of fludarabine, doxorubicin and rituximab for the treatment of CLL and newer targeted oral therapies, such as ibrutinib, idelilisib and venetoclax.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In July 2018, Eagle prevailed in its suit against the FDA to obtain seven years of orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for BENDEKA. On March 13, 2020, this decision was upheld in the appellate court. As things currently stand, drug applications referencing BENDEKA, TREANDA or any other bendamustine product will not be approved by the FDA until the orphan drug exclusivity expires in December 2022. In April 2019, we signed an amendment to the license agreement with Eagle extending the royalty term applicable to the United States to the full period for which we sell BENDEKA and increased the royalty rate. In consideration, Eagle agreed to assume a portion of BENDEKA-related patent litigation expenses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



8 

  
• | There are 15 patents listed in the U.S. Orange Book for BENDEKA with expiry dates in 2026 and 2031. In September 2019, a patent infringement action against four of six ANDA filers for generic versions of BENDEKA was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On April 27, 2020, the District Court upheld the validity of all of the asserted patents and found that all four ANDA filers infringe at least one of the patents. Three of the four ANDA filers have appealed the district court decision, but barring an adverse appellate decision, these ANDA filers should be enjoined until the patents expire in 2031. The litigation against the fifth ANDA filer was dismissed after the withdrawal of its patent challenge, and the case against the sixth ANDA filer is in the early stages of litigation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additionally, in July 2018, Teva and Eagle filed suit against Hospira, Inc. (“Hospira”) related to its 505(b)(2) new drug application (“NDA”) referencing BENDEKA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. On December 16, 2019, the Delaware District Court dismissed the case against Hospira on all but one of the asserted patents, which expires in 2031. Trial against Hospira on that patent is scheduled to begin on November 15, 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to the settlement with Eagle regarding its bendamustine 505(b)(2) NDA, between 2015 and 2020, we reached final settlements with 22 ANDA filers for generic versions of the lyophilized form of TREANDA and one 505(b)(2) NDA filer for a generic version of the liquid form of TREANDA, providing for the launch of generic versions of TREANDA prior to patent expiration.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Respiratory 
 Our respiratory portfolio includes our legacy products, ProAir and QVAR, as well as our new digital inhalers with built-in sensors: ProAir® Digihaler®, AirDuo® Digihaler® and ArmonAir® Digihaler®. Our portfolio also includes BRALTUS®, CINQAIR®/CINQAERO®, DuoResp® Spiromax® and AirDuo® RespiClick®/ ArmonAir® RespiClick®. 
 We are committed to maintaining a leading presence in the respiratory market by delivering a range of medicines for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Our portfolio is centered on optimizing respiratory treatment for patients and healthcare providers through the development and commercialization of innovative delivery systems and therapies that help address unmet needs. 
 The key areas of focus for our respiratory R&D is the development of differentiated respiratory therapies for patients using innovative delivery systems to deliver chemical and biological therapies. Our device strategy is intended to result in “device consistency,” allowing physicians to choose the device that best matches a patient’s needs both in terms of ease of use and effectiveness of delivery of the prescribed molecule, and includes three main types of devices: (i) Digihaler, which captures and shares objective inhaler use data; (ii) a breath-actuated inhaler (“BAI”) used in QVAR RediHaler®; and (iii) RespiClick (U.S.) or Spiromax (EU), a novel inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder inhaler (“MDPI”). 
 Our legacy products include ProAir and QVAR: 
 

• | ProAir HFA (albuterol sulfate) is an inhalation aerosol with dose counter and is indicated for patients four years of age and older for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm with reversible obstructive airway disease and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. ProAir HFA is among the leading quick relief inhalers in the United States. In January 2019, we launched our own ProAir authorized generic in the United States following the launch of a generic version of Ventolin® HFA, another albuterol inhaler. Generic versions of ProAir were launched in 2020.

9 

  
• | QVAR (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA) is indicated as a maintenance treatment for asthma as a prophylactic therapy in patients five years of age or older. QVAR is also indicated for asthma patients who require systemic corticosteroid administration, where adding QVAR may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic corticosteroids. Three generic manufacturers have filed ANDAs for the metered-dose inhaler (“MDI”) presentation of QVAR. We are currently asserting our patents against two of those ANDA filers in the New Jersey District Court. No trial date has been set for these pending lawsuits.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QVAR RediHaler (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA) inhalation aerosol, a BAI, is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as a prophylactic therapy in patients four years of age and older.

Results for two phase 3 clinical trials, FACT OA1 and FACT OA2, were released on August 5, 2020, indicating that the co-primary endpoints for fasinumab 1 mg monthly were achieved. Fasinumab 1 mg monthly demonstrated significant improvements in pain and physical function over placebo at week 16 and week 24, respectively. Fasinumab 1 mg monthly also showed nominally significant benefits in physical function in two trials and pain in one trial, when compared to the maximum FDA-approved prescription doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis. The FACT OA1 trial included an additional treatment arm, fasinumab 1 mg every two months, which showed numerical benefit over placebo, but did not reach statistical significance. In initial safety analyses from the phase 3 trials, there was an increase in arthropathies reported with fasinumab. In a sub-group of patients from one phase 3 long-term safety trial, there was an increase in joint replacement with fasinumab 1 mg monthly treatment during the off-drug follow-up period, although this increase was not seen in the other trials to date.

Active treatment of patients with fasinumab, which only involved dosing in an optional second-year extension phase of one trial, has been discontinued following a recommendation from the fasinumab program’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee that the program should be terminated, based on available evidence obtained to date. The core efficacy data has already been obtained to support potential fasinumab regulatory filings. Long-term safety data continues to be gathered, and is expected to be reported in 2021, along with a decision on the program.

  Other Activities 
 We have other sources of revenues, primarily the sale of APIs to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis. 
 We produce approximately 350 APIs for our own use and for sale to third parties in many therapeutic areas. APIs used in pharmaceutical products are subject to regulatory oversight by health authorities. We utilize a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high potency manufacturing, plant extract technology and peptide synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 We provide contract manufacturing services related to products divested in connection with the sale of certain business lines, as well as other miscellaneous items. Our other activities are not included in our North America, Europe and International Markets segments described above. 
 Research and Development 
 Our R&D activities span the breadth of our business, including generic medicines (finished goods and API), biosimilars, specialty medicines and OTC medicines. 
 All of our R&D activities are concentrated under one global group with overall responsibility for generics, biosimilars and specialty, enabling better focus and efficiency. 
 A strong focus for Teva is the development of new generic medicines. We develop generic products for our North America, Europe and International Markets segments. Our focus is on developing complex formulations with complex technologies, which have higher barriers to entry. Generic R&D activities, which are carried out in development centers located around the world, include product formulation, analytical method development, stability testing, management of bioequivalence, bio-analytical studies, other clinical studies and registration of generic drugs in all of the markets where we operate. We also operate several clinics where most of our bioequivalent studies are performed as well as most of our phase 1 studies for specialty and biosimilar products. We have more than 1,160 generic products in our pre-approved global pipeline, which includes products in all stages of the approval process: pre-submission, post-submission and after tentative approval. 
 In addition, our generic R&D supports our OTC business in developing OTC products, as well as in overseeing the work performed by contract developers. 
 Our current R&D capabilities include solid oral dosage forms (such as tablets and capsules), inhalation, semi-solid and liquid formulations (such as ointments and creams), sterile formulations and other dosage forms, and delivery systems, such as matrix systems, special coating systems for sustained release products, orally disintegrating systems, sterile systems, such as vials, syringes, blow-fill-seal systems, long-acting release injectable, transdermal patches, oral thin film, drug device combinations and nasal delivery systems. In addition, we are in the process of developing multiple AB-rated respiratory programs and devices for our long active injectable pipeline. 
 We pursue biosimilar pipeline projects in other therapeutic and disease areas that leverage our global R&D and commercial areas of expertise. Biosimilar development activities, such as analytical method development, testing for analytical biosimilarity, pre-clinical work, clinical studies and regulatory strategy, are conducted in Teva’s various global development sites. 
 Our specialty R&D product pipeline is focused on biologic and select small molecule products. Specialty development activities include preclinical assessment (including toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacology studies), clinical development (including pharmacology and the design, 
 
12 

  execution and analysis of global safety and efficacy trials), as well as regulatory strategy to deliver registration of our pipeline products. We develop novel specialty products in our core therapeutic and disease focus areas. We have CNS projects in areas such as migraine, pain, movement disorders/neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry. Our respiratory projects are focused on asthma and COPD and include both novel compounds and delivery systems designed to address unmet patient needs. 
 Our API R&D division focuses on the development of processes for the manufacturing of APIs, including intermediates, chemicals and fermentation products, for both our generic and proprietary drugs. Our facilities include two large development centers in India and Croatia, focusing on synthetic products, and three centers with specific expertise: a center in Hungary specializing in fermentation and semi-synthetic products, a center in Israel for oligonucleotides and a center in the Czech Republic for high-potency APIs. Our substantial investment in API R&D generates a steady flow of API products, supporting the timely introduction of generic products to market in compliance with increasing regulatory requirements. The API R&D division also seeks methods to continuously reduce API production costs, enabling us to improve our cost structure. 
 While our focus is on internal growth that leverages our R&D capabilities, we have entered into, and expect to pursue, in-licensing, acquisition and partnership opportunities to supplement and expand our existing specialty and biosimilar pipeline (e.g., the transactions with Celltrion, Regeneron and Alvotech). In parallel, we evaluate and expand the development scope of our existing R&D pipeline products as well as our existing products for submission in additional markets. 
 Operations 
 We operate our business globally and believe that our global infrastructure provides us with the following capabilities and advantages: 
 

• | global R&D facilities that enable us to have a broad global generic pipeline and product line, as well as a focused pipeline of specialty products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities approved by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities located around the world, which offer a broad range of production technologies and the ability to concentrate production in order to achieve high quality and economies of scale;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | API manufacturing capabilities that offer a stable, high-quality supply of key APIs, vertically integrated with our pharmaceutical operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high-volume, technologically advanced distribution facilities that allow us to deliver new products to our customers quickly and efficiently, providing a cost-effective, safe and reliable supply.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These capabilities provide us with the means to respond on a global scale to a wide range of therapeutic and commercial requirements of patients, customers and healthcare providers. 
 Pharmaceutical Production 
 We operate 46 finished dosage and packaging pharmaceutical plants in 22 countries. These plants manufacture solid dosage forms, sterile injectables, liquids, semi-solids, inhalers, transdermal patches and other medical devices. In 2020, we produced approximately 68 billion tablets and capsules and approximately 646 million sterile units. 
 Our primary manufacturing technologies, solid dosage forms, injectable and blow-fill-seal, are available in North America, Europe, Latin America, India and Israel. The manufacturing sites located in Israel, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, India, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic make up the majority of our production capacity. 
 We use several external contract manufacturers to achieve operational and cost benefits. We continue to strengthen our third party operations unit to strategically work with our supplier base in order to meet cost, supply security and quality targets on a sustainable basis in alignment with our global procurement organization. 
 Our policy is to maintain multiple supply sources for APIs to appropriately mitigate risk in our supply chain to the extent possible. However, our ability to do so may be limited by regulatory and other requirements. 
 
13 

  Between 2017 and 2019, we closed or divested a significant number of manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe, Israel and Japan in connection with a restructuring plan. We are continuing our ongoing efforts to consolidate our manufacturing and supply network. 
 Raw Materials for Pharmaceutical Production 
 In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase such raw materials and supplies from one source (the only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. 
 We source a large portion of our APIs from our own manufacturing facilities. Additional APIs are purchased from suppliers located in Europe, Asia and the United States. We have implemented a supplier audit program to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards and are able to fulfill the requirements of our global operations. 
 We currently have 15 API production facilities, producing approximately 350 APIs in various therapeutic areas. Our API intellectual property portfolio includes hundreds of granted patents and pending applications worldwide. 
 We have expertise in a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high-potency manufacturing, plant extract technology, peptides synthesis, vitamin D derivatives synthesis and prostaglandins synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 Our API facilities are required to comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements under U.S., European, Japanese and other applicable quality standards. Our API plants are regularly inspected by the FDA, European agencies and other authorities, as applicable. 
 Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary know-how and regulatory exclusivities, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We own or license numerous patents covering our products in the United States and other countries. We have also developed many brand names and own many trademarks covering our products. We consider the overall protection of our intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. We license or assign certain intellectual property rights to third parties in connection with certain business transactions. 
Environment, Health and Safety 
 We are committed to business practices that promote socially and environmentally responsible economic growth. During 2020, we continued to make significant progress on our multi-year plan towards our long-term environment, health and safety (“EHS”) goal referred to as “Target Zero”: zero incidents, zero injuries and zero releases. Among other things, in 2020, we: 

• | continued the implementation of our global EHS management system, which promotes proactive compliance with applicable EHS requirements, establishes EHS standards throughout our global operations and helps drive continuous improvement in our EHS performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provided EHS regulatory monitoring tools in all countries where we have significant operations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



14 

  
• | proactively evaluated EHS compliance through self-evaluation and an internal and external audit program, addressing non-conformities through appropriate corrective and preventative action.

Please see the section entitled “Environmental Sustainability” from our Teva 2019 ESG Progress Report (which is located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our environmental goals. Nothing on our website, including our 2019 ESG Progress Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or any other filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Quality 
 We are committed not only to complying with quality requirements but to developing and leveraging quality as a competitive advantage. In 2020, we successfully completed numerous inspections by various regulatory agencies of our finished dosage pharmaceutical and API plants and we actively engaged in discussions with authorities to mitigate drug shortages and participated in several industry-wide task forces. We continue to focus on maintaining a solid and sustainable quality compliance foundation, as well as making quality a priority to foster continuous compliance. We seek to ensure that quality is an embedded part of our corporate culture and is reflected in all of our daily operations, delivering reliable and high quality products. 
 For information regarding significant regulatory events, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Competition 
 Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from increasing awareness and acceptance on the part of healthcare insurers and institutions, consumers, physicians and pharmacists around the world. Factors contributing to this increased awareness are the passage of legislation permitting or encouraging generic substitution and the publication by regulatory authorities of lists of equivalent pharmaceuticals, which provide physicians and pharmacists with generic alternatives. In addition, various government agencies and many private managed care or insurance programs encourage the substitution of brand-name pharmaceuticals with generic products as a cost-savings measure in the purchase of, or reimbursement for, prescription pharmaceuticals. 
 In the United States, we are subject to competition in the generic drug market from domestic and international generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through introduction of next-generation medicines, authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. An increase in FDA approvals for existing generic products is increasing the competition on our base generic products. Price competition from additional generic versions of the same product typically results in margin pressures, which is causing some generics companies to increase focus on portfolio efficiency. 
 The European market continues to be ever more competitive, especially in terms of pricing, higher quality standards, customer service and portfolio relevance. We are one of only a few companies with a pan-European footprint, while most of our European competitors focus on a limited number of selected markets or business lines. Our leadership position in Europe allows us to be a reliable partner to fulfill the needs of patients, physicians, pharmacies, customers and payers. 
 In our International Markets, our global scale and broad portfolio give us a significant competitive advantage over local competitors, allowing us to optimize our offerings through a combination of high quality medicines and unique go-to-market approaches. 
 Furthermore, in significant markets such as Japan and Russia, governments have issued or are in process of issuing regulations designed to increase generic penetration. Specifically, in Japan, ongoing regulatory pricing reductions and generic competition to off-patented products have negatively affected our sales in Japan. These conditions result in intense competition in the generic market, with generic companies competing for advantage based on pricing, time to market, reputation and customer service. 
 
15 

  The biosimilars business is also highly competitive and continues to evolve as intellectual property protections for biological products continue to expire in the United States. While we believe that our biologics knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we anticipate significant competition in the biosimilar space. Risks related to commercialization of our prospective biosimilars include the number of competitors, potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion, and intellectual property challenges that may impact timely commercialization. There is also a risk of lower or slower uptake due to various factors that may differ among biosimilars such as competitive practices, physician hesitancy to prescribe biosimilars for certain therapeutic areas, and level of financial incentives (payer or government). We anticipate that the downward pressure on uptake may ease in the future as physicians and payers become increasingly aware of the benefits of biosimilars and more comfortable prescribing them. 
 Our specialty medicines business faces intense competition from both specialty and generic pharmaceutical companies. The specialty business may continue to be affected by price reforms and changes in the political landscape, following recent public debate in the United States. We believe that our primary competitive advantages include our commercial marketing teams, global R&D capabilities, the body of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of our various medicines, our patient-centric solutions, physician and patient experience with our medicines and our medical capabilities, which are tailored to our product offerings, regional and local markets and the needs of our stakeholders. 
 Human Capital Management 
 Our People 
 Our employees are the heart of our Company. In the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, it is imperative that we attract, develop and retain top talent on an ongoing basis. To do this, we seek to make Teva an inclusive, diverse and safe workplace, with meaningful compensation, benefits and wellness programs, and offering training and leadership development programs that foster career growth. 
 Our Human Resources and Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee and Board play key roles in overseeing culture and talent at Teva and devote time throughout the year to human capital strategy and execution in such areas as: inclusion and diversity, Company culture, employee engagement, training and development, recruiting and turnover, leadership development and succession planning. Management regularly updates the Board on internal metrics in these areas. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, Teva’s work force consisted of 40,216 employees. As a global company, we have employees in 60 countries around the world, representing a wide range of nationalities. In certain countries, we are party to collective bargaining agreements with certain groups of employees.

Inclusion and Diversity 
 Inclusion and diversity are essential to our ability to innovate and grow our business. It is our desire to create and sustain an inclusive and diverse work environment. 
 Employees identifying as female represent 45% of our global employee population, 47% of managers, and 23% of top executives, as of December 31, 2020. 
 We seek to underscore our inclusive and diverse culture through employee resource groups and training, among other things. For instance, in the U.S., the Teva Inclusion Network is made up of nine employee resource groups (“ERGs”), which have a key role in creating a culture of inclusion and bring together employees with shared characteristics and life experiences to foster opportunities for networking, mentoring, collaboration, community outreach, career development, leadership training and cultural exchanges. Currently, our ERGs include groups for women, men, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans, employees with disabilities, military veterans, pride and parenting stages. We also train and offer educational resources to our employees on unconscious bias. 
 Health and Safety 
 We believe that every person has the right to a safe and healthy work environment, and we believe all injuries, illnesses and safety incidents are preventable. We aspire toward Target Zero: Zero Incidents, Zero Injuries and Zero Releases (spills and accidental discharges). We also ensure our employees are properly trained on the safety precautions implemented across our Company. 
 Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have operated conscientiously, focusing on the health, safety and well-being of our employees as a top priority. We have reduced the number of employees in our facilities to enable social distancing by introducing virtual solutions and flexible work arrangements. We adhere to PPE and hygiene instructions to protect our people, their families and the communities where we operate and live. We handle suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases with the highest safety measures and with full respect for our employees’ privacy. 
 Employee Career Growth, Training and Development 
 We invest in employee career growth and development at Teva in order to remain competitive in our industry. Our programs also benefit employees individually by providing them with the resources they need to enhance their professional and management abilities, develop leadership skills and achieve their career aspirations. 
 We maintain a range of learning resources to support employees of all levels in developing skills and contributing to Teva’s strategy, ultimately driving business performance. Much of our employee training is in-role, amplified by global online training and locally-tailored training modules to meet different challenges, help gain new leadership and essential skills and ensure compliance with our policies. 
 
17 

  In order to measure our success at promoting talent from inside our organization, we track the proportion of positions filled with internal candidates and other related statistics. 
 To continue our employee training and development during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our in-person programs have been modified to be virtual. In addition, we equipped our managers with information and tools on effective management in times of disruption and provided employees with online resources to address the challenges of working remotely, including with respect to maintaining their well-being. 
 Compensation, Benefits and Wellness 
 Our commitment to our employees starts with compensation and benefit programs that show how we value their contributions by providing a full complement of competitive compensation, health and retirement programs for them and their families. In addition to salaries, we offer variable pay in the form of bonuses and stock-based compensation for eligible employees. We have one global annual bonus design for all eligible employees, demonstrating our One Teva culture. We offer benefits that vary by country and are designed to be competitive in the marketplace. 
 Through practical tools and local programs, we also address the physical, financial, social and emotional needs of our employees and their families. We offer programs and initiatives that promote healthy diets, physical activity and mental well-being. For example, we provide annual medical check-ups and examinations for employees across many of our markets. In addition, we enhanced our well-being programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Employee Engagement and Satisfaction 
 To understand whether our human capital strategies are effective and are resonating with our employees, and where we can improve, we conduct an annual employee survey. In 2019, 82% of our employees completed the survey. In 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 86% participated. The 2020 employee survey served as one of the ways we sought to monitor employee morale during this time. Results of the survey show that employee engagement levels are high. Employees are feeling connected with Teva’s mission and values. They feel pride in Teva’s positive impact on society and have trust in Teva’s future. Management reviews the survey results closely to determine areas for improvement and creates action plans to address any gaps. Survey results are communicated to employees though global communications and town halls and shared with our Board of Directors. 
 We have also created an initiative to recognize and celebrate Teva heroes—those who have gone above and beyond during this challenging time to deliver on Teva’s mission and provide medicines to our patients around the world. 
 Please see the section entitled “Our People” from our Teva 2019 ESG Progress Report (which is located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

 Regulation 
 United States 
 Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration 
 All pharmaceutical manufacturers selling products in the United States are subject to extensive regulation by the United States federal government, principally by the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and, to a lesser extent, by state and local governments. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the 
 
18 

  Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, manufacture, testing, safety, efficacy, labeling, approval, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale, import and export of our products. Our facilities are periodically inspected by the FDA, which has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Noncompliance with applicable requirements may result in fines, criminal penalties, civil injunction against shipment of products, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, sale or import of products, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs or BLAs and criminal prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). The FDA also has the authority to deny or revoke approvals of marketing applications and the power to halt the operations of non-complying manufacturers. Any failure to comply with applicable FDA policies and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 FDA approval is required before any “new drug” (including generic versions of previously approved drugs) may be marketed, including new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved drugs. Applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to bioequivalence (for generics), safety, toxicity and efficacy (for new drugs), product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. FDA procedures generally require that commercial manufacturing equipment be used to produce test batches for FDA approval. The FDA also requires validation of manufacturing processes so that a company may market new products. The FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to implement these requirements. 
 The federal CSA and its implementing regulations establish a closed system of controlled substance distribution for legitimate handlers. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules—Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V—with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Facilities that manufacture, distribute, conduct chemical analysis, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA inspects all registered facilities to review security, record keeping and reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration and periodically thereafter. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) established the procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic forms of brand-name drugs. This act also provides market exclusivity provisions that can delay the approval of certain NDAs and ANDAs. One such provision allows a five-year period of data exclusivity for NDAs containing new chemical entities and a three-year period of market exclusivity for NDAs (including different dosage forms) containing new clinical trial(s) essential to the approval of the application. The Orphan Drug Act grants seven years of exclusive marketing rights to a specific drug for a specific orphan indication. The term “orphan drug” refers, generally, to a drug that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans. Market exclusivity provisions are distinct from patent protections and apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products. Another provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act extends certain patents for up to five years as compensation for the reduction of effective life of the patent which resulted from time spent in clinical trials and time spent by the FDA reviewing a drug application. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, any company submitting an ANDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (i.e., an NDA that, similar to an ANDA, relies, in whole or in part, on FDA’s prior approval of another company’s drug product; also known as a “505(b)(2) application”) must make certain certifications with respect to the patent status of the drug for which it is seeking approval. In the event that such applicant plans to challenge the validity or enforceability of an existing listed patent or asserts that the proposed product does not infringe an existing listed patent, it files a “Paragraph IV” certification. In the case of ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a potential 180-day period of generic exclusivity for the first company to 
 
19 

  submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. This filing triggers a regulatory process in which the FDA is required to delay the final approval of subsequently filed ANDAs containing Paragraph IV certifications until 180 days after the first commercial marketing. For both ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications, when litigation is brought by the patent holder, in response to this Paragraph IV certification, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months or a court decision finding the patent invalid, not infringed or unenforceable. Submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application with a Paragraph IV certification can result in protracted and expensive patent litigation. 
 Products manufactured outside the United States and marketed in the United States are subject to all of the above regulations, as well as to FDA, DEA and United States customs regulations at the port of entry. Products marketed outside the United States that are manufactured in the United States are additionally subject to various export statutes and regulations, as well as regulation by the country in which the products are to be sold. 
 Our products also include biopharmaceutical products that are comparable to brand-name biologics, but that are not approved as biosimilar versions of such brand-name products. While regulations are still being developed by the FDA relating to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created a statutory pathway for the approval of biosimilar versions of brand-name biological products and a process to resolve patent disputes, the FDA has issued guidance to provide a roadmap for development of biosimilar products. 
 In August 2017, the FDA user fee reauthorization legislation, known as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) was enacted in the United States. The agreements for pharmaceuticals, biosimilars and medical devices were negotiated with industry representatives over the course of 2016 to establish the amounts regulated companies would pay the FDA to support the product review process at the agency. Various fees must be paid by these manufacturers at different times, such as annually and with the submission of different types of applications. In return for this additional funding, the FDA has entered into agreements with each of the affected industries (known as the “user fee agreements”) that commit the agency to interacting with manufacturers and reviewing applications such as NDAs, ANDAs and BLAs in certain ways, and taking action on those applications at certain times. The agency is obligated to set specific timelines to communicate with companies, meet with company product sponsors during the review process and take action on their applications. On the generics side, FDARA established a new 180-day exclusivity for certain generic drugs that are no longer protected by exclusivity or patents, as well as new programs for enhanced and priority review of certain generic drug applications. On the branded side, this was the sixth agreement between the industry and the FDA. The user fee agreement for biosimilars was reauthorized for the second time as well. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Certain Government Programs 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) from 2010 represented the most significant health care reform in the United States in over thirty years. It was passed to require individuals to have health insurance and to control the rate of growth in healthcare spending through, among other things, stronger prevention and wellness measures, increased access to primary care, changes in healthcare delivery systems and the creation of health insurance exchanges. Enrollment in the health insurance exchanges began in October 2013. However, the individual mandate was subsequently repealed by Congress in the tax reform bill signed into law in December 2017. In December 2018, a U.S. federal district court ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional, but such decision has been stayed, pending resolution by the Supreme Court following oral arguments on November 10, 2020. 
 The ACA requires the pharmaceutical industry to share in the costs of reform, by, among other things, increasing Medicaid rebates and expanding Medicaid rebates to cover Medicaid managed care programs. The ACA also included funding of pharmaceutical costs for Medicare patients in excess of the prescription drug coverage limit and below the catastrophic coverage threshold. Commencing 2019, under the ACA, pharmaceutical companies were obligated to fund 70% of the patient obligation for branded prescription pharmaceuticals in this gap, or “donut hole.” Additionally, an excise tax was levied against certain branded pharmaceutical products. The tax is specified by statute to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2019 and each year

  thereafter. The tax is to be apportioned to qualifying pharmaceutical companies based on an allocation of their governmental programs as a portion of total pharmaceutical government programs. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) administer the Medicaid drug rebate program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers pay quarterly rebates to each state Medicaid agency. Generally, for generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, manufacturers (including Teva) are required to rebate 13% of the average manufacturer price, and for products marketed under NDAs or BLAs, manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between such price and the commercial best price during a specified period. An additional rebate for products marketed under ANDAs, NDAs or BLAs is payable if the average manufacturer price increases at a rate higher than inflation and other methodologies apply to new formulations of existing drugs. 
 Various state Medicaid programs have implemented voluntary supplemental drug rebate programs that may provide states with additional manufacturer rebates in exchange for preferred status on a state’s formulary or for patient populations that are not included in the traditional Medicaid drug benefit coverage. In addition, a number of states, including New York, have enacted legislation that requires entities to pay assessments or taxes on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in order to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications. 
 Europe 
 General 
 In Europe, marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products may be obtained either through a centralized procedure involving the EMA, a mutual recognition procedure which requires submission of applications in other member states following approval by a so-called reference member state, a decentralized procedure that entails simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states or occasionally through a local national procedure. 
 During 2020, we continued to register products in the European Union, primarily using the decentralized procedure (simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states). We continue to use, on occasion, the mutual recognition and centralized procedures. 
 The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market, but it also has the potential to create complexities affecting the entire European market. 
 European Union 
 The medicines regulatory framework of the European Union requires that medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved products, receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the European Union. Authorizations are granted after a favorable assessment of quality, safety and efficacy by the respective health authorities. In order to obtain authorization, application must be made to the EMA or to the competent authority of the member state concerned. Besides various formal requirements, the application must contain the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, pre-clinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests and clinical trials. All of these tests must have been conducted in accordance with relevant European regulations and must allow the reviewer to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. 
 In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states of the European Union regulate the pricing of such products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services. These controls can result in considerable price differences among member states.

  In addition to patent protection, exclusivity provisions in the European Union may prevent companies from applying for marketing approval for a generic product for eight years (or ten years for orphan medicinal products) from the date of the first marketing authorization of the original product in the European Union. Further, the generic product will be barred from market entry (marketing exclusivity) for a further two years, with the possibility of extending the market exclusivity by one additional year under certain circumstances. 
 The term of certain pharmaceutical patents may be extended in the European Union by up to five years upon grant of Supplementary Patent Certificates (“SPC”). The purpose of this extension is to increase effective patent life (i.e., the period between grant of a marketing authorization and patent expiry) to 15 years. 
 Subject to the respective pediatric regulation, the holder of an SPC may obtain a further patent term extension of up to six months under certain conditions. This six-month period cannot be claimed if the license holder claims a one-year extension of the period of marketing exclusivity based on the grounds that a new pediatric indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison with other existing therapies. 
 In July 2019, the SPC Manufacturing Waiver Regulation came into force in the European Union (subject to certain conditions) allowing products manufactured prior to SPC expiry to be exempt from SPC infringement if such products are manufactured for export to non-European Union markets or for launch in the European Union upon expiry of the SPC. This waiver will apply from July 2, 2022 to all SPCs that come into effect after July 1, 2019 or, if the SPC was applied for after July 1, 2019, from the date the SPC comes into effect. 
 Orphan designated products, which receive, under certain conditions, a blanket period of ten years of market exclusivity, may receive an additional two years of exclusivity instead of an extension of the SPC if the requirements of the pediatric regulation are met. 
 The legislation also allows for R&D work during the patent term for the purpose of developing and submitting registration dossiers. 
 In 2016, the United Kingdom conducted a referendum and voted to leave the European Union, also known as “Brexit.” On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom government invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to exit the European Union. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union, and entered a transition period of 11 months. On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and European Union agreed on a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement and on December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the transition period. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is comprehensive, but does not cover all areas of regulation pertinent to the pharmaceutical industry, so certain complexities remain. We continue to have processes and contingencies in place to minimize their impact, and to maintain our ability to supply medicines to patients in the United Kingdom, and to supply medicines made in the United Kingdom to other markets. 
 In November 2020, the European Commission published a “Pharmaceutical strategy for Europe,” which sets out a suite of policies that will shape the future European regulatory environment. These wide-ranging policies represent a multi-year program aimed, through review and revision of existing legislation, to provide a flexible regulatory system that, amongst other things, will lead to accelerated availability of medicines and promote sustainability of that system. 
 International Markets 
 In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, we, and our partners, are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products. Such regulations may be similar or, in some cases, more stringent than those applicable in the United States and Europe. 
 Whether or not we, or our partners, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or 
 
22 

  marketing of such product in those countries. The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we, and our partners, may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information. 
 If we, or our partners, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various national, regional and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions. We are also subject to country specific data protection laws and regulations applicable to the collection and processing of personal data around the world. In addition, we are subject to various national, regional and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the emission of material into the environment. We are also subject to various national, regional and local laws regulating how we interact with healthcare professionals and representatives of government that impact our promotional and other commercial activities. 
 Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries around the world and may be introduced in additional countries in the future, although their application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired. 
 On 16 July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated Decision 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Data Privacy Shield (“Schrems II”). The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) provides that the transfer of personal data to a country outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) may, in principle, take place only if the third country ensures an adequate level of data protection, and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was previously approved by the European Commission to provide such adequate level of data protection. However, in the view of the Court, U.S. law and practice are not circumscribed in a way that satisfies requirements that are essentially equivalent to those required under EU law, and therefore the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield cannot be considered to ensure an adequate level of data protection. As a practical result of the ruling and ensuing guidance from the European Data Protection Board, companies must now verify, on a case-by-case basis, and in collaboration with the data importers, whether the law of the importer’s country ensures a level of protection for the personal data that is essentially equivalent to the EEA’s protections. If not, data exporters will need to assess whether they can implement supplementary measures to help ensure the requisite level of protection. As a result, companies are now required to conduct and document comprehensive data transfer assessments before allowing any personal data to flow from the EU to outside the EU, and if supplementary measures cannot address an adequate level of protection, then such transfers shall be restricted. Teva is preparing for these new developments by aligning our data mapping documentation with these new requirements and Teva will continue to closely monitor further guidance from authorities on how to adequately address data transfers going forward. 
 In October 2015, the European Commission adopted regulations providing detailed rules for the safety features appearing on the packaging of medicinal products for human use. This legislation, part of the Falsified Medicines Directive (“FMD”), is intended to prevent counterfeit medicines entering into the supply chain and will allow wholesale distributors and others who supply medicines to the public to verify the authenticity of the medicine at the level of the individual pack. The safety features comprise a unique identifier and a tamper-
 
23 

  evident seal on the outer packaging, which are to be applied to certain categories of medicines. FMD is effective as of February 2019. Teva’s packaging sites, distribution centers and contract manufacturing operators (“CMOs”) for the European market comply with this new requirement. 
 In November 2013, the federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”) became effective in the United States, mandating an industry-wide, national serialization system for pharmaceutical packaging with a ten-year phase-in process. By November 2018, all manufacturers and re-packagers were required to mark each prescription drug package with a unique serialized code. Teva’s packing sites, distribution centers and CMOs for the U.S. market comply with the new requirements. In addition, under the DSCSA, Teva is required by November 2023, to provide to downstream trading partners, serial number specific transaction details. This will require additional modification to the packing sites, distribution centers and CMOs for the U.S. market. Subsequently, in February 2019, the EU enacted the Falsified Medicines Directive (“FMD”), traceability requirements for drug products, which Teva complies with as well. Other countries are following suit with variations of two main requirements: (i) to be able to associate the unit data with the uniquely-identified shipping package, or (ii) to report the data for tracking and tracing of products, reimbursements and other purposes. Certain countries, such as Russia, China, Korea, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and India (for exported products), already have laws mandating serialization and aggregation and we are working to comply with these requirements. Other countries, including India (domestic market), Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Ukraine and other Latin American countries are currently considering mandating similar requirements.
