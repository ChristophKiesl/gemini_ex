Item 1. Business.
General
 Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., incorporated in Delaware in 1989, provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 13 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of four drillships and nine semisubmersible rigs, including two cold-stacked semisubmersible rigs. Our current fleet excludes two previously impaired rigs, which we expect to sell in the first half of 2021. See “– Our Fleet – Fleet Status” and “– Our Fleet – Fleet Enhancements.” 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to “Diamond Offshore,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
 As previously disclosed, on April 26, 2020 (or the Petition Date), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (or the Company) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (which we refer to, together with the Company, as the Debtors) commenced voluntary cases (or the Chapter 11 Cases) for relief under chapter 11 (or Chapter 11) of title 11 of the United States Code (or the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (or the Bankruptcy Court). The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., et al., Case No. 20-32307 (DRJ).
 Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors have continued to operate our business as a “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the following debt instruments (or the Debt Instruments):

• | the Indenture (or the Base Indenture), dated as of February 4, 1997, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor to The Bank of New York Mellon which was previously known as The Bank of New York) (as successor under the Base Indenture to The Chase Manhattan Bank), as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented and amended by the Eighth Supplemental Indenture (the “Eighth Supplemental Indenture”), dated as of November 5, 2013, between the Company and the Trustee, governing the $250 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 3.45% Senior Notes due 2023;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Base Indenture, as supplemented and amended by the Ninth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of August 15, 2017, between the Company and the Trustee, governing the $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Base Indenture, as supplemented and amended by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 8, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee, governing the $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Base Indenture, as supplemented and amended by the Eighth Supplemental Indenture, governing the $750 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 4.875% Senior Notes due 2043; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the senior 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2018, among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing lender and swingline lender, the lenders party thereto and the other parties thereto (or the Revolving Credit Agreement), under which an aggregate of approximately $442 million in principal is outstanding.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Debt Instruments provide that, as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the principal and accrued interest due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations under the Debt Instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors’ rights of enforcement in respect of the Debt Instruments are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

On January 22, 2021, the Debtors entered into the Plan Support Agreement (or PSA), among the Debtors, certain holders party thereto (or, collectively, the Consenting Noteholders) of the Company’s 3.45% Senior Notes due 2023, 7.875% Senior Notes due 2025, 5.70% Senior Notes due 2039 and 4.875% Senior Notes due 2043 (collectively, the Senior Notes) and certain holders of claims (or collectively, the RCF Claims) under the Company’s $950 million Revolving Credit Agreement, (or collectively, together with the Consenting Noteholders, the Consenting Stakeholders). Concurrently, the Debtors entered into the Backstop Agreement (as defined in the PSA) with certain holders of Senior Notes and also entered into the Commitment Letter (as defined below) with certain holders of RCF Claims to provide exit financing upon emergence from bankruptcy.
 The PSA requires the Consenting Stakeholders to support the proposed financial restructuring of the Debtors consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization attached as an exhibit to the PSA (or the Plan), the Backstop Agreement attached as an exhibit to the PSA, and the commitment letter for a revolving credit facility upon emergence from bankruptcy attached as an exhibit to the PSA (or the Commitment Letter), in each case, subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth in the PSA and the exhibits attached thereto. The Debtors have agreed to seek approval of the Plan and complete their restructuring efforts subject to the terms, conditions, and milestones contained in the PSA and otherwise comply with the terms and requirements set forth in the PSA. The PSA also provides for termination by the parties upon the occurrence of certain events.
 
Through the Restructuring contemplated in the PSA and the Plan, the Debtors expect to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases with a capital structure that we expect will position the Debtors for future success in the offshore drilling industry. 
 
As of the date of this report, the Debtors have not emerged from bankruptcy.
The Plan, the Backstop Agreement and the Commitment Letter remain subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the Restructuring and the Plan will be consummated.
 On January 22, 2021, the Debtors filed the Plan and a related disclosure statement (or the Disclosure Statement) with the Bankruptcy Court. On January 23, 2021, the Debtors also filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval of the Debtors’ Disclosure Statement prepared in connection with soliciting votes to accept the Plan and a separate motion seeking authority to enter into the Backstop Agreement and the Commitment Letter and approval of the procedures to conduct the rights offering. A hearing on such motions is currently scheduled for February 26, 2021 at 9:30 a.m. (Central Time) before the Bankruptcy Court.
 See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases” in Item 1A of this report, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of this report, Note 2 “Chapter 11 Proceedings – Chapter 11 Cases” and Note 18 “Subsequent Event” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 Going Concern and Financial Reporting in Reorganization
 The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the defaults under our Debt Instruments, and the weak industry conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidating Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. For additional information concerning our bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11, see Note 2 “Chapter 11 Proceedings” and Note 18 “Subsequent Event” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in  Item 8 of this report and “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases” in Item 1A of this report.
 Delisting of Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange
 Our common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “DO” until April 27, 2020, at which time it was removed from trading on the NYSE due to our voluntary filing of the Chapter 11 
 4

Cases. Our common stock subsequently commenced trading on the OTC Pink Open Market under the trading symbol “DOFSQ”. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases – The NYSE has delisted our common stock. Trading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks” in Item 1A of this report.
 Our Fleet
 Our fleet enables us to offer services in the floater market on a worldwide basis. A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling rig that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. 
 Semisubmersible rigs are comprised of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning, or DP, to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the sea bed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.
 A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drill site through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

(a) | Rated water depth for drillships and semisubmersibles reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed for drilling operations. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (including, but not limited to, salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Represents year rig was built and originally placed in service or year rig was redelivered with significant enhancements that enabled the rig to be classified within a different floater category than originally constructed.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | GOM means U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
----+-------------------------------


(d) | For ease of presentation in this table, customer names have been shortened or abbreviated. Warm-stacked is used to describe a rig that is idled (not contracted) and maintained in a “ready” state with a full crew to enable the rig to be quickly placed into service when contracted. Cold-stacked is used to describe an idled rig for which steps have been taken to preserve the rig and reduce certain costs, such as crew costs and maintenance expenses. Depending on the amount of time that a rig is cold-stacked, significant expenditures may be required to return the rig to a “ready” state. Contract preparation is used to describe activities undertaken by a rig that is being made ready for a future contract and may include customer-requested modifications to the rig.

 Offshore Contract Drilling Services
 Our contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. We typically obtain our contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for us to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Our drilling contracts generally provide for a basic dayrate regardless of whether or not drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts generally also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, we generally pay the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of our revenues. In addition, from time to time, our dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from our customer based upon performance.
 The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, in what we refer to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what we refer to as a term contract. Our drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost, or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of our contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally subject to mutually agreeable terms and rates at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, 
 6

while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – We may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs” and “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us,” in Item 1A of this report. For a discussion of our contract backlog, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contract Drilling Backlog” in Item 7 of this report. 
Customers 
 We provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we performed services for 10, 12 and 13 different customers, respectively. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, our most significant customers were as follows:

 | Percentage of Annual Consolidated Revenues | 
-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----
Customer | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2018
Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. | | 21.2 | % | | 19.5 | % | 15.8 | %
BP | | 20.5 | % | | 3.1 | % | 10.5 | %
Occidental (formerly Anadarko) | | 20.1 | % | | 20.6 | % | 33.8 | %
Hess Corporation | | 10.7 | % | | 28.9 | % | 25.0 | %
Shell | | 10.2 | % | | 5.2 | % | 1.0 | %

 No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our annual total consolidated revenues during 2020, 2019 or 2018. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our customer base is concentrated” in Item 1A of this report. 
 As of January 1, 2021, our contract backlog was an aggregate $1.2 billion attributable to nine customers, compared to $1.6 billion as of January 1, 2020 attributable to ten customers. For the two-year period 2021 to 2022, $0.5 billion (or 52%) of our current contracted backlog is attributable to future operations with two customers. For the years 2023 to 2024, $0.3 billion (or 100%) of our current contracted backlog is attributable to future operations with a single customer. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contract Drilling Backlog” in Item 7 of this report. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized” in Item 1A of this report. 
 Competition
 Based on industry data, as of the date of this report, there are approximately 730 mobile drilling rigs (drillships, semisubmersibles and jack-up rigs) in service worldwide, including approximately 210 floater rigs. Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of our competitors may have greater financial or other resources than we do. 
 Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 
 We compete on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. See “Markets.”  Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. The current oversupply of offshore drilling rigs also intensifies price competition. See “Risk Factors

– Risks Related to Our Business and Operations – Our industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition” in Item 1A of this report.
 Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. See “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks – We are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs,” “Risk Factors –– Regulatory and Legal Risks – Regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business” and “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks – If we, or our customers, are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to delay, suspend or cease our operations” in Item 1A of this report.
 Human Capital
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, we managed a global workforce of approximately 1,900 persons including international crew personnel, a portion of whom are furnished through independent labor contractors. A portion of our workforce outside of the U.S. is represented by collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2020, over 75% of our global workforce had been employed by us for five years or more, with an average tenure of 11.5 years. 
Core Values and Culture
 Our global culture is shaped by our Values & Behaviors:
  
• | Take Ownership – Run to the challenge; deliver on what you promise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Go Beyond – Solve tomorrow’s problems today; make it better than you found it.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Have Courage – Challenge conventional thinking; speak up, even when it’s tough.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exercise Care – Respect that every action has consequences; never cut corners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Win Together – Learn from each other; share success; champion a “Culture of We.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These core values establish the foundation for our culture and represent the key expectations we have of our employees. Our commitment to Health, Safety and the Environment (or HSE) applies throughout our business. In addition, we recognize the importance of identifying, assessing and promoting Environmental, Social and Governance (or ESG) issues as a fundamental part of conducting business. 
 Along with our core values, we expect our employees to act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which we refer to as our Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as legal compliance, conflicts of interest, accuracy of financial reporting and disclosure, confidentiality, discrimination and harassment, anti-corruption, safety and health and reporting ethical violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline).
 Talent Management Approach
 We take a systemic approach to hiring, training and developing our employees.  This includes creating goals aligned to company priorities and providing employees periodic feedback in order to assess and adjust individual performance. We also employ a succession planning process that identifies suitable candidates, and their development needs, for key positions in the company.  The succession plan is generally reviewed annually.
 8

We provide a comprehensive training program that ensures employees on our rig crews receive position-specific training as an integral part of their career development. We utilize a competency verification program for establishing and verifying the knowledge, skills and abilities needed by each employee to perform their assigned job function in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
 Safety and Training
 The safety of our employees and stakeholders is our highest priority. We pride ourselves on being an innovative leader in the development and implementation of sophisticated and efficient job safety programs. We not only try to work safely; we strive to achieve zero incident operations, or ZIO, through our comprehensive safety initiatives. Achieving ZIO means operating at peak performance and completing each task without harm to our people, the environment or our equipment.
