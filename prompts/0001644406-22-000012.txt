Item 1. Business
Who We Are
Hostess Brands, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries) (“We” or the “Company”) is a leading sweet snacks company focused on manufacturing, marketing, and distributing snack products in North America sold primarily under the Hostess® and Voortman® brands. We produce a variety of new and classic treats including iconic Hostess® Donettes®, Twinkies®, CupCakes, Ding Dongs®, and Zingers®, as well as Voortman® branded cookies and wafers. Our mission is to inspire moments of joy by putting our  into everything we do. We seek to leverage our iconic brands, pricing power, impactful innovation, efficient manufacturing and distribution model, collaborative customer and strategic sourcing partnerships, and strong cash flows to drive profitable and sustained growth.
Our business operates in growing categories and snacking occasions, with our best-in-class business model, consumer insights and strong marketing and innovation capabilities. Our Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) products represented 21.3% of their category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-weeks ended January 1, 2022. Our cookie and wafer products represented 1.9% of the adjacent Cookie category, providing a significant opportunity for growth. We believe our strong brand history and market position in the growing spaces in which we compete, combined with our innovative spirit and scalable operating model, provide a strong platform to execute our growth initiatives. 
We have invested significantly in retailer and consumer data analytics to identify new opportunities in the spaces in which we compete. These investments, combined with our Direct-to-Warehouse (“DTW”) distribution model, support our leading brand position within the $7.3 billion U.S. SBG category and the adjacent $7.7 billion Cookie category and have increased our reach, paving a path towards future sustained, profitable growth.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers, which allows us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels. 
Brands and Products
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. Our extensive portfolio of timeless and universally recognized names such as Twinkies®, Ho Hos® and Ding Dongs® evokes an emotional affinity with consumers that has the potential to be further unlocked through effective marketing and occasion and consumer-insight based innovation. We produce under our Voortman® brand, which we acquired in 2020, cookie and creme wafer products, including sugar-free varieties. We also produce Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill® and Big Texas® branded products. Our classic treats target different spaces and consumer needs. 
Our Growth Strategy
We execute against our growth strategy and strengthen our Hostess® and Voortman® brands by focusing on faster-growing snacking occasions through innovation, marketing, strategic sourcing partnerships and strong partnerships with our customers. We leverage our highly efficient and profitable business model and productivity initiatives to maintain the momentum of our growth fly-wheel, while unlocking our balance sheet to pursue strategic opportunities.
Our Business Sits in Growing Spaces
We compete in growing snacking categories. The $91 billion sweet snacking universe has grown at an annual rate of 4.8% over the last three years. The number of consumers eating five or more snacks per day has increased double digits since 2018. 
The U.S. SBG and Cookie categories combined are a significant portion of this universe, with retail sales of $15 billion according to the Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52-weeks ended January 1, 2022. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars and brownies).  Our Voortman® branded cookies and wafer products are included in the Cookie category and provide another platform to capitalize on the on-going growth in snacking. Voortman’s products are in the specialty cookie segment and benefit from consumer demand for better-for-you ingredients. With consumers snacking to satisfy hunger, provide an emotional lift and increase social connection, we believe our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these broader snacking trends.
We believe that we have maintained the Hostess® brand equity and high awareness for over a century by satisfying consumers’ needs for great-tasting sweet treats. We have established our leadership position in the SBG category through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting brands and pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. 
We plan to capitalize on the strength of our brands and our effective retailer economics to drive growth by attracting new consumers through wide-scale availability, meaningful innovation and targeted marketing. Our market share gains are expected to come from attracting new consumers within our target consumer occasions through our continued investment in quality, targeted marketing, product innovation and a focus on our most effective brands and products. Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking, evidenced by our 92% brand awareness for Hostess®.
We continue to launch new partnerships and enter into licensing agreements that leverage our iconic brands. We have partnered with companies in various industries to bring our iconic brands and flavor profiles to complementary products such as popcorn and pudding mixes. Our Voortman® branded products are sold throughout the U.S. and Canada. Both our Hostess® and Voortman® products are distributed by third parties internationally, including products packaged specifically for Mexico and the United Kingdom, among others. In addition, our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms.
We understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the traditional offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We continue to invest in new product development, building our long-term innovation pipeline and leveraging our portfolio and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion.

Best in Class Business Model
Our business model is based on the wide availability of our products and unique go-to-market approach, both enabled by our DTW distribution model. The DTW model uses centralized distribution and common carriers. We ship the majority of our products from a centralized distribution center in Edgerton, Kansas. Centralizing our distribution improves visibility and control of distribution and is a key component of our operating model. We utilize other smaller distribution centers focused on certain products or geographic areas. The distribution centers allow us to consolidate inventory and fill customer orders, while reducing overall inventory on-hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. The majority of our products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. 
The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain customers.
We believe our DTW distribution model allows our products to be everywhere consumers shop for snacks. It provides greater reach into convenience and drug stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Historically, DSD sweet baked goods companies have competed with candy and tobacco companies for distribution; however, under our DTW model, we partner with third-party distributors to profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels. In 2021, the convenience and drug channels accounted for 31.3% of our net revenue. We have established a strong presence and market share in the convenience and drug channels and are focused on continuously expanding coverage. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward. 
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of our retail sales, which makes prominent in-store placement important. The DTW and centralized distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugate displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, economically produced and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load; thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both us and the retailer. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our branded merchandising and the ability to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which our competitors predominantly serve through a DSD model.
We have a tailored channel-based go-to-market model that demonstrates key capabilities for growth. We continue to invest in data capabilities, which enable focus on store-level compliance and growth opportunities with our Hostess Partner Program (“HPP”). We also have a unique consortium retail merchandising approach where we partner with brokers to drive in-store performance at lower costs, ensuring strong shelf presence and sending a stream of retail and customer data back to our marketing and sales teams.
Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities and offers our retail partners attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We continue to invest in the business to further our strategic initiatives. Our disciplined capital investment plan focuses on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation with strong return on investment metrics. We are making targeted investments in the production capacity to enable further expansion of our fastest growing product forms. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. 
Consumer Capabilities
We leverage our consumer capabilities to drive incremental growth above the category. We strive to meet our consumers at their need states with innovative products and cultivate top-of-mind awareness through efficient digital advertising. 
Innovation is key to fueling our growth. We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing them in order to stay relevant with our consumer base and attract new consumers. We believe that to support our market position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. We are focused on continuing to innovate and expand our core products by launching new flavors of iconic products and expanding new product forms, pack-sizes and packaging to target faster growing snacking occasions and drive incremental revenue and profit. Our Hostess® Bouncers, which are expected to launch in summer 2022, provide the consumer the same iconic Hostess® cake and filling flavors in a fun, poppable, portable form. Our Hostess® Boost Jumbo Donettes®, which contain the caffeine equivalent of one cup of coffee, launched in the convenience store channel in February 2022 and are on-trend with consumer needs to energize while on the go. The success of our product innovation is in part driven by deeper understanding of consumers’ snacking occasions and providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. 
Our acquisition of Voortman provides us opportunities to respond to additional consumer preferences. Our Hostess® Crispy Minis products were introduced in late 2020 and leverage Voortman’s production capabilities, extending the Hostess® brand into a new bite-size wafer form. In January 2022, we launched Voortman® sugar-free mini cookies and peanut butter wafers, both targeting incremental, younger, health-conscious consumers.
We are increasing our digital advertising to efficiently reach consumers. Our analysis shows that simply reminding consumers about Hostess® could drive incremental sales. As opposed to more traditional media, digital advertising provides us the flexibility and agility to invest in more targeted areas and demographics as we learn about the impact of our programs. This results in an efficient, high-return investment that we expect will drive continued growth.
Execute Strategic Acquisitions to Accelerate Growth
We have a solid platform for growth through acquisitions. Within the broader snacking universe the opportunity exists to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, infrastructure and performance-driven management culture. We are committed to seeking out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The acquisition of Voortman in January 2020 diversified and expanded our product offerings and manufacturing capabilities in the attractive, adjacent $7.7 billion Cookie category (based on Nielsen data as of January 1, 2022). The acquisition also leverages our broad customer reach and lean and agile business model. During 2020, we integrated Voortman’s distribution model into our DTW structure, with all Voortman U.S. sales shipping through our centralized distribution center. In addition to sharing established, efficient infrastructure, sales of Voortman® brand products have benefited from the strengthening of collaborative retail partnerships in the United States and Canada. 
As we explore other strategic acquisition opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage our core capabilities to reinvigorate acquired brands and further expand within the wider snacking universe. We will also consider our ability to integrate acquisitions with our existing business and the opportunities to generate synergies through leveraging our existing assets and warehouse model. The successful integration of Voortman exhibits our ability to execute and integrate acquisitions in adjacent categories. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to execute and integrate additional acquisitions.
Competitive Landscape
We compete in the broad snacking universe with a focus on sweet snacks within targeted consumer snacking occasions. Hostess® is the #2 brand in the U.S. SBG category, according to Nielsen retail data. The top three brands, Little Debbie, Hostess® and Entenmann’s account for 66% of the SBG retail sales, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration in the category, consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment, required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, provide additional barriers to entry.
Voortman® has the #1 creme wafer and sugar-free cookie products within the larger Cookie category. Nabisco® is the top brand with approximately 43% of the category according to Nielsen. There is higher private label penetration in the Cookie category than the SBG category.
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators and supermarket chains with their own private label brands. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Grupo Bimbo, S.A., McKee Foods Corporation and Mondelez International, Inc. In addition, we also compete with regional manufacturers and other companies that produce cookies, candies and other snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products which helps mitigate this impact.
Seasonality
SBG revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns. 
COVID-19
We continue to monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and adjust our operations in response. As discussed further below, as well as in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, we have taken and continue to take actions to respond to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 and to protect the health and well-being of our entire team, their families and the communities we serve.
Production
We have an efficient, agile, resilient and scalable model that delivers quality results. Our products are primarily produced at five bakeries located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and Burlington, Ontario. Our state of the art auto-bake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. Additionally, we have made high-ROI investments with the installation of new Donette® and cake lines in 2020 and 2021. The majority of our products are shipped through a centralized distribution center in Edgerton, Kansas. This facility was opened in 2020 and has expanded our distribution capacity by 75% and removed two million miles from our distribution network.
With the increase in demand for our products, we continue to make adjustments to our production schedules, product assortment and equipment to maximize production capacity in our existing facilities. We are diligent in our efforts to find opportunities to reduce complexity and drive value within our supply chain. A portion of our products are manufactured and packaged by third parties under our brands and distributed through our facilities. 
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are cooking oil, sugar, coatings and flour, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for certain raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We approach sourcing with a holistic strategy to acquire the best quality ingredients and packaging materials at the lowest possible cost. We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to increase over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials for efficiency. We have multiple vendors that meet our supply requirements for the majority of our sole sourced ingredients. With respect to the sole sourced ingredients for which we do not have multiple vendors to meet our supply requirements, including certain enzymes used in our ESL technology, we are evaluating alternative sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility.
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2021 accounted for 59.5% of total net revenue. During 2021, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and related entities, represented 18.9% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2021 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers and distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess®, Voortman®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill®, and Big Texas® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. This provides us the opportunity to sell our products at premium price points and pursue licensing opportunities.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to the development of innovative snack products based on consumer insights and process technology. These products help address new user occasions and seek to bring new consumers into the category based on changing preferences and trends. Through the development timeline, research guidance testing to optimize attributes based on appropriate taste, flavor and texture combined with efficient cost management, helps support our growth. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to our manufacturing team to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our specifications and high standards of quality. Finally, our research and development department is charged with developing processes to optimize our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products. During 2020, we opened an innovation lab within our Lenexa, Kansas corporate office. This lab provides us increased rapid prototyping, speed to market and small-scale batch process experimentation along with the testing capabilities, analytics and market research insights needed to support our growth objectives.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the “CFIA”) and Health Canada for Canadian Operations. Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, ingredient standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, hazard analysis and risk-based preventative controls, food labeling and advertising, hazard reporting and recall requirements, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. Also, we are subject to compliance with movement restrictions and other efforts by local governments to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We take compliance and the safety of our products and employees seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 2,600 people. Of our total workforce, approximately 91% were located at our bakeries. The remaining workers comprised functions including operations management, sales and supply chain, among other corporate functions.
Health & Safety
Safety remains our top priority, and we are proud to have achieved the best safety results in our over eight year history. We have improved our total safety record four years running, with 2021 results for key metrics scoring best in class for categories consistent with Occupational Safety & Heath Administration (OSHA) standards. For the full year, we achieved a Total Incident Rate (TIR) of 1.25 vs. Commercial Bakery average of 4.24. We develop and maintain safety policies in our facilities and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance. We believe new automation, safety investments and behavioral safety training have resulted in higher employee engagement and lower workers’ compensation costs. Managing the global pandemic remains a focus in our health and safety agenda. As established in 2020, our approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic has been driven by three key principles: 
•The safety of our employees, their families, and communities is our top priority
•We’ll continue to service our customers and consumers
•We’ll stay nimble and informed
In 2021, we continued the enhanced cleaning and safety protocols introduced at the beginning of the pandemic, and conduct daily audits of our facilities, ensuring we are following through with our efforts to maintain a safe working environment for our employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Corporate Sustainability
We launched our first Corporate Responsibility Report in May 2021, identifying four key areas of focus for the Company - Governance, Equity & Inclusion, Health and Safety and Environmental. We also highlighted achievements which position us as a responsible, caring member of the communities in which we operate as evidenced through our environmental impact, and community involvement via product and monetary donations and employee volunteer activities. 
Labor
Our ability to achieve sustained, profitable results is predicated on our ability to attract, retain, and engage a team of employees aligned on a common purpose: to deliver products that create moments of joy for our customers and consumers. We are committed to providing a safe work environment, competitive wage and benefits packages, career development opportunities and an inclusive culture that encourages each employee to bring their whole self to work.
There were unprecedented labor challenges across the U.S. during 2021 and while this issue impacted us like virtually all employers, we have worked closely with our employees to ensure we can deliver on the promise of our Mission, Vision, and Values in serving our customers and consumers. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union in Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Georgia and Burlington, Ontario; and AFL-CIO and the Chemical Production Workers Union Local No. 30 in Chicago, Illinois. Approximately 1,100 employees are covered by these collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to be good and have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
We agreed to a three-year contract in our Indianapolis location in December, 2021, as well as extending the agreement for our Chicago, Illinois bakery by two years, through May 31, 2025. 
We offer competitive wages and benefits, including medical, dental, vision, paid parental leave, paid time off, and a number of other programs to best suit the needs of our employees. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging
To best achieve our desired results, it is vital that employees are comfortable bringing their whole selves to work. We believe diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging efforts are key to maintaining our positive culture. In addition to training and education at all levels, in 2021 we formed an enterprise-wide DEI&B Team, which identified opportunities to improve our culture, including the planning and execution of celebration and appreciation events for a variety of groups, including the launch of a Speakers Series, programming around culture and appreciation events, and review and enhancement of our diversity policies and practices.

Culture & Engagement
The Company’s culture is an integral part of our strategy, built on creativity, commitment, collaboration, positive energy, and strong sense of ownership. We envision a world where the everyday is worth celebrating. We inspire moments of joy by putting our  into everything we do. We launched our Mission, Vision, and Values in May 2021 to ensure everyone on our team understands the purpose of our work. 
To better understand the full experience of our employees, and to hear what they value, and what they believe could be improved, we launched our first Pulse of Hostess Brands engagement survey in May 2021. Through this process, we identified key themes in every location and department and are engaged in action planning to make our work environment even better. Using both live roundtable sessions with small groups of employees and virtual sessions with executive leadership, we regularly check in with our employees to identify issues needing attention, while sharing key messages with all employees through quarterly Town Hall meetings. In 2021, we also launched the Hostess Hero award, our highest employee honor, which recognizes leadership and character.
Embodying these behaviors is a strong and experienced management team, led by Andy Callahan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Members of the management team have extensive experience in the consumer packaged goods industry across the sales, operations, marketing, human resources, legal, and finance disciplines.
