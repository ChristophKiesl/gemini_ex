 Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Montauk, the Company, we, us or our refer to Montauk Renewables, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 Company Overview 
 Overview 
 We are a renewable energy company specializing in the recovery and processing of biogas from landfills and other non-fossil fuel sources for beneficial use as a replacement to fossil fuels. We develop, own, and operate RNG projects, using proven technologies that supply renewable fuel into the transportation and electrical power sectors. We are one of the largest U.S. producers of RNG, having participated in the industry for over 30 years. We established our operating portfolio of 12 RNG and three Renewable Electricity projects through self-development, partnerships, and acquisitions that span six states and have grown our revenues from $33.8 million in 2014 to $100.4 million in 2020. 
 Biogas is produced by microbes as they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen (during a process called anaerobic digestion). Our two current sources of commercial scale biogas are LFG or ADG. We typically secure our biogas feedstock through long-term fuel supply agreements and property lease agreements with biogas site hosts. Once we secure long-term fuel supply rights, we design, build, own, and operate facilities that convert the biogas into RNG or use the processed biogas to produce Renewable Electricity. We sell the RNG and Renewable Electricity through a variety of short-, medium-, and long-term agreements. Because we are capturing waste methane and making use of a renewable source of energy, our RNG and Renewable Electricity generate valuable Environmental Attributes which we are able to monetize under federal and state initiatives. 
 Based on our analysis, we believe there are numerous sources of waste methane in the United States that could serve as potential future project opportunities. We expect to continue our growth through optimization of our current project portfolio, securing greenfield developments and acquiring existing projects, all while pursuing vertical integration opportunities. Our successful evaluation and execution of project opportunities is based on our ability to leverage our significant industry experience, relationships with customers and vendors, access to interconnections for rights-of-way, and capabilities to construct pipeline and electrical interconnections that ensure the economic viability of opportunities we pursue. We exercise financial discipline in pursuing these projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related attributes that can be monetized. 
 Our current operating projects generate RNG from landfill sites and livestock farms. We view livestock farms as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business and we are also evaluating other agricultural markets. We believe that our business is highly scalable, which will allow us to continue to grow through development and acquisitions. 
 Our projects provide our landfill and livestock farm partners with a variety of benefits, including a means to monetize biogas from their sites, support their regulatory compliance, and provide them with environmental services. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on our long history of working with leading vendors and technologies and through our extensive expertise in designing, tuning and managing gas control collection systems at our host sites. We have significant experience with commercialized beneficial uses of processed biogas, including pipeline quality natural gas, power generation, carbon capture and boiler fuel gas products.

 Our revenues are generated from the sale of RNG and Renewable Electricity, under long-term contracts, along with the Environmental Attributes that are derived from these products. RNG has the same chemical composition as natural gas from fossil sources, but has unique Environmental Attributes assigned to it due to its origin from low-carbon, renewable sources, which we can also monetize. Virtually all of the RNG we produce is used as a transportation fuel because this market generally provides the most value for our RNG production. The RNG we process is pipeline-quality and can be used for transportation fuel when converted to CNG or LNG. CNG has been the most common fuel used by fleets where medium-duty trucks are close to the fueling station, such as city fleets, local delivery trucks, and waste haulers. The Environmental Attributes that we sell are composed of RINs and state low-carbon fuel credits, which are generated from the conversion of biogas to RNG that is used as a transportation fuel, as well as RECs generated from the conversion of biogas to Renewable Electricity. In addition to revenues generated from our product sales, we also generate revenues by providing operations and maintenance services to certain of our biogas site partners. 
 Whenever possible, we seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity and Environmental Attribute pricing volatility. Through contractual arrangements with our site hosts and counterparties, we typically share pricing and production risks while retaining our ability to benefit from potential upside. A significant portion of the RNG volume we produce is sold under bundled fixed-price arrangements for the RNG and Environmental Attributes, with a sharing arrangement where we benefit from prices above certain thresholds. For our remaining RNG projects, we sometimes enter into in-kind sharing arrangements where our partners receive the Environmental Attributes instead of a cash payment, thereby sharing in the Environmental Attribute pricing risk. 
 We strive to sell our remaining RNG and environmental products under medium-and long-term indexed pricing and margin sharing arrangements designed to give us optimal price and revenue certainty. On the electricity side, all of our products and related Environmental Attributes are sold under fixed-price contracts with escalators, limiting our pricing risk. Finally, our payments to our site hosts are entirely in the form of royalties based on realized revenues, or, in some select cases, based on production volumes. 
 The Montauk Model 
 


Reorganization Transactions 
 Montauk Holdings Limited, a corporation formed under the laws of the Republic of South Africa (MNK), was a holding company whose ordinary shares were traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) under the symbol MNK. Prior to the initial public offering (the IPO) of our common stock, 100% of MNKs 
 
-2- 


  business and operations were conducted through its U.S. subsidiaries, including Montauk Holdings USA, LLC (Montauk USA) and Montauk Energy Holdings LLC (MEH), and it held no assets other than the equity of its subsidiaries. 
 On January 4, 2021, we entered into a share exchange with Montauk USA in which we replaced Montauk USA as the top tier subsidiary of MNK and we became the direct parent company of MEH. On January 26, 2021, prior to the completion of the IPO, of all of the outstanding shares of Company common stock was distributed by MNK as a pro rata dividend to holders of MNKs ordinary shares and, as a result, all of the shareholders of MNK became stockholders of the Company. 
 As we are the successor to all of Montauk USAs interests in MEH, we present historical consolidated financial statements of Montauk USA. In connection with the above transactions (the Reorganization Transactions) and the IPO, the existing shareholders of MNK became stockholders of Montauk. Following the Reorganization Transactions and the closing of the IPO, MNK has been delisted from the JSE and will be liquidated prior to January 26, 2022. 
 Following the IPO, the Companys common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol of MNTK and on the JSE under the ticker symbol of MKR.

Market Opportunity 
 Increasing Demand for RNG 
 Demand for RNG produced from biogas is significant and growing in large part due to an increased focus by the public and governments on reducing the emission of GHG, such as methane, and increasing the energy independence of the United States. According to the EPA, methane is a significant GHG, which accounted for roughly 9.5% of all U.S. GHG emissions from human activities in 2018 and which has a comparative impact on global warming that is about 25 times more powerful than that of carbon dioxide (which is produced during the combustion process). Biogas processing facilities could substantially reduce methane emissions at landfills and livestock farms, which together accounted for approximately 27% of U.S. methane emissions in 2018 according to the EPA. The development of this energy source further supports the U.S. national security objective of attaining energy independence, as evidenced by Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), which aimed to increase U.S. energy security, develop renewable energy production, and improve vehicle fuel economy. 
 Over the past decade, the fastest growing end market for RNG has been the transportation sector, where RNG is used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth has been driven, in large part, by more aggressive environmental subsidies to support the production of renewable transportation fuels. According to NGV America, a national organization dedicated to the development of a growing, profitable, and sustainable market for vehicles powered by natural gas or biomethane, from 2015 to 2020, RNG use as a transportation fuel increased 291%, displacing close to 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

 Given public calls for, and U.S. federal, state and local regulatory trends and policies aimed at, reducing GHG emissions and increasing U.S. energy independence, we expect continued regulatory support for RNG as a replacement for fossil-based fuels and therefore continued and growing demand for RNG over the next several years. 
 Availability of Long-Term Feedstock Supply 
 Biogas can be collected and processed to remove impurities for use as RNG (a form of high-Btu fuel) and injected into existing natural gas pipelines as it is fully interchangeable with natural gas. Partially treated biogas can be used directly in heating applications (as a form of medium-Btu fuel) or in the production of electricity. Common sources of biogas include landfills, livestock farms, and WRRFs. 
 Landfill- and livestock-sourced biogas represent a significant opportunity to produce RNG and Renewable Electricity, while also reducing GHG emissions. While landfill projects for RNG and Renewable Electricity have been developed over the past few decades, undeveloped landfills remain a significant source of biogas. Moreover, as technology continues to develop and economic incentives grow, livestock farm biogas, in particular, represents a relatively untapped biogas opportunity. 
 While LFG has accounted for most of the growth in biogas projects to date, we believe that additional economically viable LFG project opportunities exist. According to the EPALMOP project database, as of August 2020, there were 565 LFG projects in operation in the United States, including 399 operating LFG-to-electricity projects that may be converted to produce RNG, 11 construction projects, and 54 planned RNG and Renewable Electricity projects, as well as 477 additional candidate landfills. Based on EPA data, these 477 candidate landfills have the potential to collect a combined 499 million standard cubic feet of LFG per day, or the equivalent of carbon dioxide emissions from approximately 63,000 barrels of oil. Based on our industry experience and technical knowledge and analysis, after evaluating their currently available LFG collection systems and potential production capacities, we believe that approximately 25 of these sites are potentially economically viable as projects for acquisition and growth. In the future, additional candidate landfills may become economically viable as their growth increases LFG production and requires installation of LFG collection systems. 
 The LFG market is heavily fragmented, which represents, in our view, a good opportunity for companies like ours to find project opportunities. The top ten players account for approximately 53% of installed LFG capacity as of August 2020, and over 90% of developers own five or fewer projects, according to the EPA. Aside from the top five players in the industry, which includes us, no company accounts for more than 5% of the total LFG-to-energy capacity. Within the LFG market, over three-quarters of projects are Renewable Electricity projects with PPAs dating back as far as 1984. As these PPAs expire, these legacy facilities present an opportunity for conversion to RNG facilities, which, in certain instances, can provide better financial terms than Renewable Electricity projects. This market fragmentation and limited expertise in RNG processing by other market participants creates significant acquisition opportunities for us. 
 Biogas from livestock farm waste also represents significant opportunities for RNG production that remain largely untapped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as of June 2018, biogas recovery systems are feasible, notwithstanding economic viability considerations, at 2,704 dairy farms and 5,409 swine farms in the United States, with potential to produce roughly 172.0 million MMBtu of RNG annually, or the equivalent of the carbon dioxide emissions from 4,556 million gallons of gasoline. Although many of the EPA identified project sites are not currently economically viable because of distance from pipelines and contaminants in the biogas, among other reasons as described above, we believe that there is potential for sustained growth in biogas conversion from waste sources given our significant experience in evaluating sites and assessing their viability, evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics. Additionally, all-in prices paid for RNG from livestock farms can be significantly higher than prices for RNG from landfills due to state-level low-carbon fuel incentives for these projects. Given our strong understanding of 
 
-5- 


  biogas processing and our market leadership in RNG, we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in this emerging market. 
 The availability of additional waste streams, including from organic waste diversion, food waste, sludge, and wastewater, in combination with technological advances permitting new or more economical waste processing also have the potential to support long-term feedstock supply availability and the growth of our business. 
 Use of Environmental Attributes to Promote RNG Growth 
 When used as a transportation fuel or to produce electricity, RNG can generate additional revenue streams through Environmental Attributes. Environmental Attributes are provided for under a variety of programs, including the national RFS program and state-level RPS and LCFS. 
 The RFS program requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. To fulfill this regulatory mandate, the EPA requires Obligated Parties to blend renewable fuel with standard fuel to meet RVOs. Obligated Parties can comply with RVOs by either blending RNG into their existing fuel supply or purchasing RINs. RINs are generated when eligible renewable fuels are produced or imported and blended with a petroleum product for use as a transportation fuel. The RFS program has been a key driver of growth in the RNG industry since 2014 when the EPA ruled that RNG, when used as a transportation fuel, would qualify for D3 RINs (for cellulosic biofuels), which are generally the most valuable of the four RIN categories. In 2020 and 2019, our projects generated approximately 13.5% and 15.1%, respectively, of all D3 RINs in the United States. 
 The monetization of RNG also benefits from low-carbon fuel initiatives at the state-level, specifically from established programs in California and Oregon. The CA LCFS requires fuel producers and importers to reduce the CI of their products, with goals of a 10% reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 and a 20% reduction by 2030. CARB awards CA LCFS credits to RNG projects based on each projects CI score relative to the target CI score for gasoline and diesel fuels. The CI score represents the overall net impact of carbon emissions for each RNG pathway and is determined on a project-by-project basis. Based on our expected CI scores, we anticipate that RNG produced by livestock farms can potentially earn two to three times the amount of revenue per MMBtu relative to RNG produced from LFG projects. Several other states are considering LCFS initiatives similar to those implemented in California and Oregon. 
 Additionally, biogas is considered to be a renewable resource in all 37 states that encourage or mandate the use of renewable energy. Thirty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have RPS that require utilities to supply a percentage of power from renewable resources, and seven states have a Renewable Portfolio Goal that is similar to RPS, but is not a requirement. Many states allow utilities to comply with RPS through tradable RECs, which provide an additional revenue stream to RNG projects that produce electricity from biogas. 
 Our Strengths 
 Management and Project Expertise 
 Our management team has decades of combined experience in the development, design, construction and operation of biogas facilities that produce RNG and Renewable Electricity. We believe that our teams proven track record and focus on development of RNG projects gives us a strategic advantage in continuing to grow our business profitably. Our diverse experience and integration of key technical, environmental, and administrative support functions support our ability to design and operate projects with sustained and predictable cash flows. 
 Our experience and extensive project portfolio has given us access to the full spectrum of available biogas-to-RNG and biogas-to-Renewable Electricity conversion technologies. We are technology agnostic and base project design on the available technologies (and related equipment) most suitable for the specific 
 
-6- 


  application, including membranes, media, and solvent-based gas cleanup technologies. We are actively engaged in the management of each project site and regularly serve in engineering, construction management, and commissioning roles. This allows us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the operational performance of each technology and how to optimize application of the technology to specific projects, including through enhancements and improvements of operating or abandoned projects. We also work with key vendors on initiatives to develop and test upgrades to existing technologies. 
 We continually seek to optimize the highest-value use of our existing assets. Because our equipment is modular, it can be disassembled and redeployed from one site to another at a lower cost than new greenfield development. For example, when equipment capacity at an existing project is larger than needed and can be repurposed for newer sites with larger production and growth potential where that capacity can be more fully utilized. This can occur at older landfill sites that have limited or no acceptance of waste intake or at sites where fuel supply agreements have expired, but where the equipment still has sufficient remaining useful life. 
 Access to Development Opportunities 
 We have strong relationships throughout the industry supply chain from technology and equipment providers to feedstock owners, and RNG off-takers. We believe that the trust and strong reputation we have attained in combination with our understanding of the various and complex Environmental Attributes gives us a competitive advantage relative to new market entrants. 
 We leverage our relationships built over the past several decades to identify and execute new project opportunities. Typically, new development opportunities come from our existing relationships with landfill owners who value our long operating history and strong reputation in the industry. This includes new projects with or referrals from existing partners. These relationships include Waste Management and Republic Services, the two largest waste management companies in the United States, which operate ten of our 14 landfill sites. We are the leading third-party developer for Waste Management and operate projects on both private and publicly owned landfills. We actively seek to extend the term of our contracts at our project sites and view our positive relationships with the owners and managers of our host landfills as a contributing factor to our ability to extend contract terms as they come due. Additionally, as one of the largest producers of RNG from LFG, we also frequently receive RFPs from landfill owners for new biogas facilities at their landfills. 
 Finally, our prominence in the industry often makes us a preferred suitor for owners seeking to sell existing projects. Acquisition opportunities often come to our attention by direct communications with industry participants as well as firms marketing portfolios of project. 
 Large and Diverse Project Portfolio 
 We believe that we have one of the largest and most technologically diverse project portfolios in the RNG industry. Our ability to solve unique project development challenges and integrate such solutions across our entire project portfolio has supported the long-term successful partnerships we have with our landfill hosts. Because we are able to meet the varying needs of our host partners, we have a strong reputation and are actively sought out for new project and acquisition opportunities. Additionally, our size and financial discipline generally affords us the ability to achieve priority service and pricing from contractors, service providers, and equipment suppliers. 
Environmental, Health and Safety and Compliance Leadership 
 Our executive team places the highest priority on the health and safety of our staff and third parties at our sites, as well as the preservation of the environment. Our corporate culture is built around supporting these priorities, as reflected in our well-established practices and policies. By setting and maintaining high standards in the renewable energy field, we are often able to contribute positively to the safety practices and policies of our 
 
-7- 


  host landfills, which reflects favorably on us with potential hosts when choosing a counterparty. Our high safety standards include use of wireless gas monitoring safety devices, active monitoring of all field workers, performing periodic EHS audits and using technology throughout our safety processes from employee training in compliance with operational processes and procedures to emergency preparedness. By extension, we incorporate our EHS standards into our subcontractor selection qualifications to ensure that our commitment to high EHS standards is shared by our subcontractors which provides further assurances to our host landfills. As of December 31, 2020, excluding two incidents related to COVID-19, our year-to-date TRIR was 0.865 which is lower than the 2019 national average of 1.20 TRIR for the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction industries and the 2019 national average of 3.00 TRIR for all industries. As of December 31, 2020, we have not received any U.S. OSHA or state OSHA citations in the last five years. Our EHS programs include partnering with Blackline Safety to provide each of our site employees with a four-gas monitoring device with work-anywhere wireless capabilities; emergency response protocols for all locations which include facility and landfill access, gate access, and site specific alerts to account for employee safety at all points throughout the workday; a learning management system that combines traditional online safety training and instructor-led training; and monthly evaluations for training compliance at each operations facility. 
 Our Strategy 
 We aim to maintain and grow our position as a leading producer of RNG in the United States. We support this objective through a multi-pronged strategy of: 

 | promoting the reduction of methane emissions and expanding the use of renewable fuels to displace fossil-based fuels;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanding our existing project portfolio and developing new project opportunities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanding our industry position as a full-service partner for development opportunities, including through strategic transactions; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanding our capabilities to new feedstock sources and technologies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Promoting the Reduction of Methane Emissions and Expanding the Use of Renewable Fuels to Displace Fossil-Based Fuels 
 We share the renewable fuel industrys commitment to providing sustainable renewable energy solutions and to offering products with high economic and ecological value. By simultaneously replacing fossil-based fuels and reducing overall methane emissions, our projects have a substantial positive environmental impact. We are committed to capturing as much biogas from our host landfills as possible for conversion to RNG. As a leading producer of RNG, we believe it is imperative to our continued growth and success that we remain strong advocates for the sustainable development, deployment and utilization of RNG to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels while increasing our domestic energy production. 
 Many of our team members have been involved in the renewable fuel industry for over 30 years. We are a founding member and active participant in the RNGC. The RNGC was formed to provide an educational platform and to be an advocate for the protection, preservation and promotion of the RNG industry in North America. The RNGCs diverse membership includes each sector of the RNG industry, such as waste collection and management companies, renewable energy developers, engineers, bankers, financiers, investors, marketers, transporters, manufacturers, and technology and service providers. Our participation allows us to align with industry colleagues to better understand the challenges facing the industry and to collaborate with them to develop creative solutions to such problems. 
 As a founding member of the RNGC and participant in several RNGC technical committees, we regularly participate in conferences and regulatory initiatives, including lobbying, to address key issues and promote the RNG industry. Collaborating with the diverse RNGC membership provides us with a holistic view of the RNG 
 
-8- 


  industry, which aides us in identifying emerging trends and opportunities. Our participation allows us to align with industry colleagues to better understand the challenges facing the industry and to collaborate with them to develop creative solutions to such problems. A primary function of the RNGC is to educate those in the natural gas industry, including pipeline owners, who are not familiar with RNG and its fungibility with traditional pipeline natural gas. We are focused on maintaining and nurturing our relationships with pipeline off-takers and seek to ensure that such relationships are a priority, including by maintaining continuous communication, enforcing stringent real-time monitoring of our product quality, and providing marketing material to assist with their corporate sustainability messaging. 
 Expanding Our Existing Project Portfolio and Developing New Development Opportunities 
 We exercise financial discipline in pursuing projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related attributes that can be monetized. We are currently evaluating three project expansion opportunities at existing project sites and one new electricity-to-RNG conversion project. We regularly analyze several potential new projects that are at various stages of negotiation and review. The potential projects typically include a mix of new project sites, project conversions and strategic acquisitions. Currently, no new potential projects are subject to definitive agreements and each potential opportunity is subject to competitive market conditions. 
Montauk Growth Channels 
 


Expanding Operations at Existing Project Sites. We monitor biogas supply availability across our portfolio and seek to maximize production at existing projects by expanding operations when economically feasible. Most of our landfill locations continue to accept waste deliveries and the available LFG at these sites is expected to increase over time, which we expect to support expanded production. This has allowed us to maintain average production availability of approximately 76% at our RNG projects and 92% at our electricity projects, weighted by 2020 expected production, excluding projects that commenced operation in 2020. Additionally, we are evaluating opportunities to utilize excess gas for RNG production at some of our electricity projects. Most recently, we increased the gas production at our McCarty project by 7% through an expansion project completed in January 2018, as described below. 
 We treat our existing assets as an integrated portfolio rather than a collection of individual projects. This allows us to utilize any new business practices across our entire project portfolio quickly, including advances with respect to troubleshooting, optimization, cost savings, and host site interaction. For example, we recently 
 
-9- 


  were able to take advantage of findings from a root cause failure analysis on a particular piece of equipment at a single project site to improve maintenance on similar equipment throughout our portfolio. We frequently identify services that result in a positive reaction from our project partners and then communicate that to other project managers so that they can incorporate such services into their project sites. Our integrated, pro-active and value-add approach helps us maintain strong relationships with our partners, which can often lead to term extensions and new opportunities. 
 We also experience organic growth in production at our existing projects because of increases in biogas supply at our projects and continued operation optimization. We size our projects to account for this increase in the biogas supply curve over time. For example, at many of our newer projects, such as Apex and Galveston, we expect gradual increases in production as those landfill sites continue to grow. Additionally, many of our expansion efforts to date, such as those at McCarty and Rumpke, have helped to optimize our project capacity to take advantage of excess biogas at older landfills that are still open and growing. Not only have these projects achieved an initial increase in production following the expansion project, but we also expect to see continued gradual increases over time. 
 Case Study of an Expansion Project: McCarty Landfill: The McCarty landfill is owned and operated by Republic Services and is one of the largest waste disposal facilities in Texas. Our RNG project at this landfill was originally constructed as a 3,892 MMBtu/day facility that achieved commercial operations in 1986. In January 2018, we undertook and completed an expansion of the project to increase RNG production by 7%, to a design capacity of 4,415 MMBtu at a cost of $2.1 million. The expansion effort added blower capacity, which increased the inlet pressure to the main compressors leading to higher production. The increased output from the project did not require amendments to our existing fuel supply and off-take agreements. Prior to commissioning the expansion, we applied for and obtained the necessary permits and other approvals to expand the project and the interconnects that we relied upon at this project. Engineering and design activities began in February 2017, with construction beginning in August 2017 and commissioning in November 2017. 
 Expanding through Acquisition. The RNG industry is highly fragmented with approximately 90% of operating projects owned by companies that own five or fewer projects. We believe that these small project portfolios present opportunity for industry consolidation. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this consolidation opportunity because of our scale, operational and managerial capabilities, and execution track record in integrating acquisitions. Over the last ten years, we have acquired 11 projects and members of our current management team have led all of those acquisitions. We expect that as we continue to scale up our business, our increased size, industry position and access to capital will provide us with increased acquisition opportunities. 
 Converting Existing Electricity Projects to RNG. We periodically evaluate opportunities to convert existing projects from electricity generation to RNG production. These opportunities tend to be attractive for our merchant electricity projects given the favorable economics for RNG plus RIN sales relative to merchant electricity rates plus REC sales. This strategy has been an increasingly attractive avenue for growth since 2014 when RNG from landfills became eligible for D3 RINs. Historically, we have taken advantage of these opportunities on a gradual basis as PPAs for our electricity projects have expired. To date, we have converted two projects from LFG-to-electricity to LFG-to-RNG and one project from ADG-to-electricity to ADG-to-RNG, and we are currently evaluating a fourth conversion opportunity for LFG-to-RNG.
Looking forward, several of our development and pipeline projects may convert existing electricity projects to RNG. For example, the existing generation facilities at the Coastal Plains project, which currently sells merchant power and RECs into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market, was shut down in May 2019 and was converted to an RNG production facility with commercial operations that commenced in September 2020.
Case Study of a Conversion Project: Atascocita Landfill: We acquired the Atascocita project, an LFG-to-electricity project located in Humble, Texas, from Viridis Energy (Texas), LP in 2011. The Atascocita

  landfill is owned and operated by Waste Management. Electricity produced by the facility was sold on a merchant basis into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. Recognizing an opportunity to realize returns on favorable pricing for RNG and RIN attributes, we approached Waste Management about converting the project to RNG in 2016. We signed an updated gas supply agreement with Waste Management in October 2016, which included a royalty based on the monetization of Environmental Attributes, including RINs and LCFS credits. Construction was managed in-house and completed over 19 months after the gas supply agreement was signed, with the project achieving commercial operations in May 2018, making it one of the largest plants constructed for processing RNG. All of these aspects required unique design and implementation along with cooperation from Waste Management in order to meet regulatory requirements. 
 New equipment installed includes membrane separation, nitrogen removal, deoxygenation, and H2S removal technologies. The repurposed facility has a design capacity of 5,570 MMBtu/day. Known vendors and suppliers were used to procure the majority of equipment and systems. As such, timely ordering and delivery of equipment was achieved relative to the construction schedule. The total capital expenditures to convert Atascocita were approximately $40 million. The project has a remaining fuel supply contract with Waste Management for 20 years from commercial operation. 
 Leveraging and Creating Long-Term Relationships. Dependable and economic sources of renewable methane are critical to our success. Our projects provide our landfill and livestock farm partners with a variety of benefits, including a means to monetize biogas from their sites and support their regulatory compliance. By addressing the management of byproducts of our project hosts primary businesses, our services allow landfill owners and operators and livestock farms to increase their permitted landfill space and livestock count, respectively. These services facilitate long-term relationships with project hosts that may serve as a source for future projects and relationships. 
 Expanding Our Industry Position as a Full-Service Partner for Development Opportunities, Including Through Strategic Transactions 
 Over our three decades of experience, we have developed the full range of RNG project related capabilities from engineering, construction, management and operations, through EHS oversight and Environmental Attributes management. By vertically integrating across RNG services, we are able to reduce development and operations costs, optimize efficiencies and improve operations. Our full suite of capabilities allows us to serve a multi-project partner for certain project hosts across multiple transactions, including through strategic transactions. To that end, we actively identify and evaluate opportunities to acquire entities that will further our vertically-integrated services. 
Expanding Our Capabilities to New Feedstock Sources and Technologies 
 We intend to diversify our project portfolio beyond landfill biogas through expansion into additional methane producing assets, while opportunistically adding third-party developed technology capabilities to boost financial performance and our overall cost competitiveness. We are commercially operating our first livestock waste project (dairy), actively pursuing new fuel supply opportunities in WRRFs, and looking at long-term organic waste and sludge opportunities. The drive toward voluntary and most likely regulatory-required organic waste diversion from landfills is of particular interest as we leverage our current experience base, and we believe this trend will provide long-term growth opportunities. 
 We believe that the market has not yet unlocked the full potential of RNG and Renewable Electricity. We do not own any material registered intellectual property. However, as biogas processing technology continues to improve and the required energy intensity of the RNG and Renewable Electricity production process is reduced, we expect that we will be able to enter new markets for our products, such as providing fuel for the production of energy sources. With our experience and industry expertise, we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities to meet the clean energy needs of other industries looking to use renewable energy in their operations.

 Products Sold 
 The revenues received from selling renewable energy consist of two main components. The first component is revenues from the commodity value of the natural gas or electricity generated. The second component is from the Environmental Attributes derived from the production of RNG and Renewable Electricity. For RNG, Environmental Attribute revenues are substantially generated from RINs when used as a transportation fuel. In addition, RNG can generate an additional revenue stream when used as a transportation fuel in states that have adopted low-carbon fuel incentive programs. The primary Environmental Attributes derived from the production of electricity from renewable resources are RECs, which translate into additional revenues for units of Renewable Electricity produced. 
RNG 
 LFG and gas from livestock digesters can be processed into pipeline-quality RNG by removing the majority of the non-methane components including carbon dioxide, water, sulfur, nitrogen, and other trace compounds. RNG can be used for transportation fuel when compressed (CNG) or liquefied (LNG) and virtually all of the RNG we produce is used in this manner. 
 RNG, like traditional natural gas, is traded nationally. Once in an interstate pipeline, RNG can be transported to vehicle fueling stations to be used as a transportation fuel, to utilities to generate power, or for use in generating fuel cell energy anywhere within the North American pipeline system. This flexibility enables us to capture value from the renewable attributes of biogas by delivering RNG to markets and customers that place a premium on renewable energy. 
 RNG is priced in line with the wholesale natural gas market, based on Henry Hub pricing, with regional variation according to demand and supply issues. We sell the RNG produced from our projects under a variety of short-term and medium-term agreements to counterparties, with tenures varying from three years to five years. Our contracts with counterparties are typically structured to be based on varying natural gas price indices for the RNG produced. We also share a portion of our Environmental Attributes with our off-take counterparties as consideration for the counterparty using our RNG as a transportation fuel. 
 D3 RINs 
 RNG has the same chemical composition as natural gas from fossil sources, but has unique Environmental Attributes assigned to it due to its origin from organic sources. These attributes qualify RNG as a renewable fuel under the federal RFS program, established pursuant to the EPACT 2005 and EISA, allowing RNG to generate renewable fuel credits called RINs when the RNG is used as a transportation fuel. 
 RINs are saleable regulatory credits that represent a quantity of qualifying fuel and are used by refiners and importers to evidence compliance with their RFS obligations. Given that the RFS is a national program, the price of a RIN is the same anywhere in the United States. The RFS program originally contemplated 1.75 billion gallons of fuel from cellulosic biofuels by 2014, the use of which would be tracked through D3 RINs. However, cellulosic biofuel production grew slower than expected, with 2013 output at only 281,819 gallons (422,740 RINs). This prompted the EPA to expand the definition of biofuels that could qualify for D3 RINs in July 2014, to include fuels from cellulosic biogas, including biogas from landfills, livestock farms, and WRRFs. This significantly increased the quantity of D3 RINs produced, with production increasing to approximately 33 million net RINs in 2014 and 505 million net RINs in 2021. In addition, given the historic shortage in supply of D3 RINs to meet blending requirements, the EPA allows obligated refiners to satisfy RFS compliance obligations for D3 RINs by either purchasing CWC plus D5 RINs or by purchasing D3 RINs. CWC prices are set annually as the greater of (i) $0.25 or (ii) $3.00 (as adjusted by Consumer Price Index) less the average wholesale price of gasoline for the most recent 12-month period of data available as of September 30th prior to the calendar year in question. CWC prices are typically published by the EPA each November, with an announced CWC price for 2020 of $1.80. The value of a D3 RIN is therefore a derivative of the market price for D5 RINs and CWCs, which in turn are inversely linked to the wholesale price of gasoline. 
 
-12- 


 We have been active in the RFS program since 2014 and expect to remain a significant contributor to the overall generation of RINs from RNG. We monetize our portion of the RINs, directly, at auction or through third-party agents or marketers. 
 CA LCFS 
 CA LCFS credits are environmental credits generated in California in order to stimulate the use of cleaner, low-carbon fuels. This program encourages the production of low-carbon fuels by setting annual CI standards, which are intended to reduce GHG emissions from the states transportation sector. One of the key aspects of the program is that it encourages the use of low-carbon transportation fuel, such as CNG, in vehicles instead of gasoline. This program further encourages use of renewable fuels in vehicles over CNG from fossil fuels. 
 The value of an CA LCFS credit varies according to the CI value of the fuel source as determined by CARB. Fuels that have a lower CI score benefit from a higher CA LCFS credit. RNG from LFG and livestock digester biogas that are used as a transport fuel both qualify for CA LCFS credits. The number of CA LCFS credits for RNG from livestock digesters is significantly higher than the number of CA LCFS credits for RNG from landfills, due to the relative CI scores of the two fuels. Fuel that is eligible for RINs can also receive CA LCFS credits. As a result, CA LCFS credits represent a revenue stream incremental to the value RNG producers receive for RINs. For livestock digester RNG projects, CA LCFS credits are a substantial revenue driver. We currently earn CA LCFS credits on seven of our projects, and we expect the revenue generated by CA LCFS credits to increase as we continue to develop and bring additional livestock digester projects online over the next few years. 
 Several states in the United States also have or are considering adopting this model. Oregons Clean Fuels Program, enacted in 2009 and implemented in 2016, operates using a credit system similar to the CA LCFS program. Similar to RINs, LCFS credits can be sold separately from the RNG fuel sold, allowing us to monetize LCFS credits for fuel produced and purchased outside of states that have LCFS programs. 
 Renewable Electricity 
 Electricity is a commodity that trades and is priced on a regional basis in and among regional control areas. Pricing for commodity-sold electricity can be based on day-ahead prices for scheduled deliveries or hourly, real-time prices for unscheduled deliveries. Prices vary across the country based on weather, load patterns and local power and transmission restrictions. The Renewable Electricity produced at our biogas-to-electricity projects is sold under long-term contracts to credit-worthy counterparties, typically under a fixed price with escalators. The terms of these contracts range from 5 to 22 years, with a weighted average remaining tenure of 14 years, based on 2021 expected electricity production. 
 RECs 
 Biogas is considered to be a renewable resource in all 37 states that encourage or mandate the use of renewable energy. Thirty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have RPS that require utilities to supply a percentage of power from renewable resources, and seven states have a Renewable Portfolio Goal that is similar to RPS, but is an objective or goal and not a requirement. Many states allow utilities to comply with RPS through tradable RECs, which provide an additional revenue stream to RNG projects that produce electricity from biogas. 
 The value of a REC is dependent on each states renewable energy requirements as mandated by its RPS. REC values are higher in states which require a percentage of total electricity to come from renewable resources. In states with no renewable energy requirements, RECs can have no value at all. In some markets, we have entered into PPAs under which we sell RECs and other renewable attributes bundled with the power being sold at 
 
-13- 


  a combined price. This occurs where the utility off-take counterparty offers a combined rate for the renewable energy it needs to satisfy RPS or other business requirements that is the best combined price for one of our projects. 
 Our Projects 
 We currently own and operate 15 projects, 12 of which are RNG projects and three of which are Renewable Electricity projects. Of our three Renewable Electricity projects we currently operate, we expect to convert one of them to produce RNG. In addition to the electricity-to-RNG conversion project, we are currently in the process of developing one additional RNG project from LFG. We are also working on other projects which will repurpose equipment from existing biogas facilities for use at new project sites.

 We have a long history of operating our projects with partners, with our oldest relationship going back 46 years. On average, we have had an 18-year history with our current project site owners. Our operating RNG

  projects have an average expected remaining useful life of approximately 19 years, as weighted by 2021 expiration. Our operating electricity projects have an average expected remaining useful life of approximately 14 years, as weighted by 2021 expected expiration. 
 Approximately 93% of our 2020 RNG production has been monetized under fuel supply agreements with expiration dates more than 15 years from December 31, 2020. Additionally, approximately 96% of our 2020 Renewable Electricity production has been monetized under fuel supply agreements with expiration dates more than 15 years from December 31, 2020. Concurrent with our fuel supply agreements, we typically enter into property leases with our project hosts, which govern access rights, permitted activities, easements and other property rights. We own all equipment and facilities on each leased property, other than equipment provided by utility companies providing services on-site. Lease termination typically requires the restoration of the leased area to its original condition. We have successfully ended leases on four facilities and are currently restoring a fifth facility. 
 Once collected, biogas can be processed into pipeline-quality RNG or converted into electricity. The conversion facility is typically located on landfill property away from the active fill operations where additional waste is added to the landfill site. 
 An RNG project involves the conversion of raw LFG into pipeline quality gas for introduction to a natural gas transmission or distribution line. An RNG plant processes the gas by removing the majority of the non-methane components including carbon dioxide, water, and other volatile and non-volatile organic compounds to attain pipeline quality gas. This complex process has numerous variables that need to be managed in order to be cost-effective and efficient. At the end of the gas processing chain, RNG is typically compressed and then sold into a natural gas pipeline or to a dedicated end user. These sales occur at market prices for the energy and the value of the Environmental Attributes derived from the use of the RNG as a transportation fuel. 
 Our projects currently utilize three of the four proven commercial technologies available to process raw biogas into RNG, including: pressure swing absorption (PSA), Membrane Filtration and solvent scrubbing. We also have historically used the other proven technology, refrigerated physical absorption, commonly referred to as Kryosol; however, it is not in use at any of our existing operating projects. All four of these technologies have similar features, but are distinguished primarily by the means employed to separate carbon dioxide from methane in biogas. We are capable of working with virtually all available biogas processing technologies at our sites. We attend industry conferences and maintain an ongoing dialogue with key equipment providers to ensure we stay informed of the latest technology that could be deployed at our current and future facilities. 
 Electricity is generated using gas-fueled engines or turbine-driven electrical generators, which are designed to operate efficiently on medium-Btu gas. As such, electricity generation typically involves producing medium-Btu gas, which is then pumped into a generating facility. The electricity is metered and sold under long-term contracts to utilities and municipalities or at spot prices. 
 Stated capacity reflects the design capacity of each facility. Several of our projects have reserve capacity when comparing design capacity to available biogas feedstock. Several previous acquisitions are gas limited and operate in this fashion. Our larger projects are at or near design capacity and either have expansions planned or are being evaluated for future expansions dependent on the availability of excess biogas feedstock.

 Typically, a biogas-to-RNG facility includes three phases: biogas collection, primary processing and additional processing. 
 At landfills, biogas collection systems can be configured as vertical wells or horizontal trenches. The most common method is drilling vertical wells into the waste mass and connecting the wellheads to lateral piping that transports the gas to a collection header using a blower or vacuum induction system. Horizontal trench systems are useful in areas of landfills that continue to have active filling. Some landfills use a combination of vertical wells and horizontal collectors. Collection system operators tune or adjust the wellfield to maximize the volume and quality of biogas collected while maintaining environmental compliance. 
 A basic biogas processing plant includes a knock-out drum to remove moisture, blowers to provide a vacuum to pull the gas and pressure to convey the gas, and a flare. System operators monitor parameters to maximize system efficiency. Using biogas in an energy recovery system usually requires some treatment of the gas to remove excess moisture, particulates, and other impurities. The type and extent of treatment depends on site-specific biogas characteristics and the type of energy recovery system. Treatment of the gas typically includes the removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), moisture and contaminants within the gas, and then separation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the methane (CH4). Further treatment of the biogas is often required to remove residual nitrogen and/or oxygen to meet pipeline specifications. Some end uses, such as pipeline injection or vehicle fuel projects, require additional cleaning and compression of the biogas. 
 Illustrative Projects 
 Rumpke. The Rumpke landfill, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, is an open landfill with significant filling capacity available. The landfill, which is our largest site by capacity, currently holds approximately 62 million tons of waste, receives over 10,000 tons of waste per day and is expected to operate through 2052 under its 
 
-16- 


  current permits. The landfill has filed for a new MSW permit to expand its footprint. The MSW permit includes a Land-GEM model that anticipates the landfill accepting waste through 2085. 
 At this site, we own and operate a 15 million standard cubic feet per day (SCFD) RNG processing facility using PSA technology. The facility consists of one, six million SCFD plant that was placed into service in 1985, one, five million SCFD plant that was placed into service in 2007 and one, three million SCFD plant that was placed into service in 1994. Pursuant to a fuel supply agreement with the owner of the landfill, we have fuel for this project through December 31, 2037. We are responsible for operation, maintenance and costs of this sites biogas collection system. 
 The Rumpke project is registered with the EPA as a qualified facility for the generation of RINs under the RFS program and with CARB as a qualified facility for the generation of CA LCFS credits for fuel generated for use as a transportation fuel. We currently sell the RNG and Environmental Attributes produced at this facility at a fixed price. The fixed price is supplemented by sharing of incremental revenues from monetization of the Environmental Attributes under a margin sharing agreement. 
 Atascocita. The Atascocita landfill, located in Humble, Texas, is an open landfill with approximately 25.3 million tons of capacity available. The landfill currently holds approximately 36.4 million tons of waste, receives over 3,600 tons of waste per day and is expected to operate through 2045 under its current permits. 
 At this site, we shut down a merchant electricity project that was only able to process a portion of the gas the site was producing and repurposed it to an RNG project where we own and operate a 10.8 million SCFD RNG processing facility using membrane separation technology. The project was placed into service in May 2018. The plant is equipped with membrane separation, nitrogen removal, deoxygenation, and H2S removal technologies. Pursuant to a fuel supply agreement, we have fuel supply for this project through May 1, 2038. We are responsible for the operation, management and capital costs of the processing facility. 
 The Atascocita project is registered with the EPA as a qualified facility for the generation of RINs under the RFS program and for fuel generated for use as a transportation fuel. We currently sell the RNG produced at this facility at market prices under contract through 2023, and separately sell the RINs produced to Obligated Parties on either a spot or forward basis based on current calendar year. 
 McCarty. The McCarty landfill, located in Houston, Texas, is an open landfill that holds approximately 62.4 million tons of waste, receives approximately 4,573 tons per day, has been in operation since 1967 and is expected to operate through 2024 under its current permits. 
 At this site, we own and operate a nine million SCFD RNG gas processing facility that employs Selexol, a solvent scrubbing based gas separator technique. 
 Pursuant to a fuel supply agreement, we have fuel supply for this project through December 31, 2036, and we are responsible for the operation, management and capital costs of the LFG collection system.

Illustrative Projects 
 Bowerman Power. The Bowerman Power Facility, located in Irvine, California, is an open landfill with over 54 million tons of waste, receives approximately 6,800 tons of waste per day, has been in operation since 1990, and is expected to operate through 2053 under its current permits. 
 At this site, we own and operate a 19.6 MW (net) electricity generation facility which consists of seven CAT CG-260-16 reciprocating engine generator sets. The Bowerman facility is located in the southern part of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) Regional Transmission Organization. CAISO is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of California and Nevada. CAISO acts as a neutral, independent party that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market and manages the high-voltage electricity grid. CAISO provides an attractive and ready market for energy, capacity and RECs for new and existing resources. 
 Bowermans electricity output is sold under a PPA with the City of Anaheim, California, with a term running through 2036. Pursuant to a fuel supply agreement with the owner of the landfill, we have fuel supply for this project through 2067. 
 New Projects 
 Much of our historic growth has come from the addition of new projects either through third-party acquisitions or new development. We plan to leverage both of these avenues for growth as we seek to continue to expand our business. We exercise financial discipline in pursuing these projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related attributes that can be monetized. We are currently evaluating project expansion opportunities at existing project sites and a new electricity-to-RNG conversion project. We regularly analyze several potential new projects that are at various stages of negotiation and review. The potential projects typically include a mix of new project sites, project conversions and strategic acquisitions. As of March 15, 2021, no new potential projects are subject to definitive agreements and each potential opportunity is subject to competitive market conditions. 
Acquisition of Existing Projects 
 Pursuing opportunities for acquisitions of existing projects has and continues to be a key component of our growth strategy. Small project portfolios present the opportunity for industry consolidation that we believe we 
 
-18- 


  are well-positioned to take advantage of because of our scale, operational efficiency, execution track record and technological flexibility. In evaluating new opportunities, we often look for underperforming projects or underutilized sites where we can leverage our premier operational platform to optimize efficiency at these facilities. As we continue to acquire new projects, we have the ability to improve synergies across our portfolio that we believe give us an advantage over other LFG operators and new entrants into the industry. 
 While new project and acquisition opportunities exhibit attractive processable biomethane quantities, we are experienced in both understanding the common deviations between feedstock projections (both in quantity and quality), and the best approach to plan and execute on development investments in making those projections reality. In evaluating a potential project, we evaluate whether there is economically viable access to an interconnection. We use our experience in the complexities of interconnection study and design, the securitization of rights-of-way, oversight of utility construction and self-construction of pipeline and electrical interconnections to determine economic viability. In addition to interconnection experience, our experience in detailed and scheduled preventative maintenance allows us to develop realistic operating cost projections for greenfield and other acquisition project opportunities at their onset. 
 In particular, a major focus area for us is the acquisition of existing LFG-to-electricity projects that we can convert to RNG. We look for opportunities where existing operators have a PPA with a limited remaining contract life or are selling power on a merchant basis and where sites are located close to existing natural gas pipelines. We believe we have a competitive advantage in pursuing these opportunities because of our strong track record as an RNG producer. Cleaning up biogas for use as RNG is a significantly more involved process than electricity production. There are few others that have the capabilities that we have to tune wellfields to process gas in the manner needed to produce pipeline-quality RNG. As a result, we are well-positioned to acquire these projects where the existing operator is not positioned to pursue the technology conversion on their own and merchant electricity prices do not support continued operation of the electricity facility. 
 Much of our historic growth has been achieved through acquisitions and our management team has significant experience in identifying, executing, closing and integrating acquisitions. Most recently, we closed on an acquisition of an existing anaerobic digester and Jenbacher engines at a large commercial dairy farm in Idaho. The project was converted to an RNG facility in order to sell transportation fuel into the California transportation market and began commercial operation in August 2020. 
 Our operational capabilities across a broad array of gas clean-up and electricity generation technologies, including solvent scrubbing, PSA, membrane separation, reciprocating engines, and turbines, gives us flexibility to pursue a variety of potential projects. We have strong relationships with most major industry vendors and landfill owners. We believe we can use these existing relationships and our reputation in the industry to identify potential transactions and to minimize concerns about a change of the operator of a biogas project. 
 Greenfield Development 
 We are always looking for opportunities to expand our portfolio through new projects that we can design, build, own and operate at greenfield sites. A significant portion of our pipeline for new development comes from our existing relationships with landfill owners who value our long operating history and strong reputation in the industry. This includes new projects with existing partners as well as projects we have sourced through referrals from existing partners. For example, our Apex project, which was completed in 2019, came to us through our existing relationship with the landfill owner. 
 As one of the largest producers of RNG from LFG, we also frequently receive RFPs from landfill owners for new biogas facilities at their landfills. We exercise financial discipline in pursuing these projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects and associated feedstock costs, offtake contracts and any other related attributes that can be monetized. 
 
-19- 


 With our broad geographic footprint, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in states where we currently operate. Although we believe that many of the EPA identified candidate landfills are not currently economically viable, approximately 40% of the these sites that we have identified as potentially economically viable are located in states in which we currently operate and we believe, due to our industry experience and technical knowledge, we will continue to be able to identify potentially economically viable sites in these locations in the future. Additionally, we also currently operate in three of the top four states with the largest biogas production potential from livestock farms. Our geographic footprint strategically positions us to take advantage of these opportunities given our existing relationships with operators, vendors and regulators, and our ability to realize operational synergies with nearby projects.

 Historically, our business has grown through new LFG projects. While we will continue to pursue LFG opportunities, we also anticipate projects that utilize other sources of fuel supply, including livestock farms and WRRFs, as major opportunities to further expand and diversify our footprint. 
Dairy 
 We view dairy farms as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business. Processing biogas from dairy farms requires similar expertise and capabilities as processing biogas from landfills. Meanwhile, the collection of the fuel supply is much easier at dairy farms than at landfills due to higher quality, more uniform feedstock, less volatility in inlet gas and biogas collection in a more controlled environment. 
 The presence of our digester benefits dairy farmers in a number of ways, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. We assist in managing the waste for the dairy farmer, which they would otherwise have to manage. Additionally, processing this waste in a digester is significantly more environmentally friendly by reducing GHG emissions. Finally, a byproduct of the production process can be returned to farmers for use as bedding, alleviating the need to purchase other materials for bedding for the cows. 
 We undertook a dairy farm project when we closed on the acquisition of Pico, the anaerobic digester and two Jenbacher engines at the Bettencourt dairy farm in Jerome, Idaho in September 2018. The project sources manure from a dairy farm with up to approximately 18,500 milking cows. While Pico was initially a Renewable Electricity site, we have developed an RNG facility at this project that came online in August 2020. The facility sells transportation fuel into the California transportation market.Other Waste Sources 
 Our long-term strategy is to continue to seek new opportunities for biogas processing with alternative sources of fuel supply as we have done recently with our entrance into the dairy farm biogas industry. Other industries that present opportunities of scale for biogas conversion include swine farms and WRRFs. Similar to dairy farms, biogas production from swine farms is a nascent biogas industry, with less than 1% of swine farms with biogas processing capabilities. Additionally, roughly 23% of WRRFs have biogas processing facilities, however, most process biogas for electricity production creating additional opportunities for acquisition and conversion to RNG facilities. As with LFG and dairy farms, biogas from both swine farms and WRRFs qualify for D3 RINs under the RFS program. We believe our demonstrated versatility to operate processing facilities using multiple fuel supply sources will give us a competitive advantage in these markets relative to other new entrants who have only demonstrated capabilities with one fuel supply source. 
Fuel Supply Agreements 
 A critical component of our business is our ability to negotiate and maintain long-term fuel supply agreements. We have developed strong working relationships with our landfill site owners, including ten of 
 
-20- 


  14 operating projects and one development project with Waste Management and Republic Services, the two largest waste companies in the United States, and actively seek to strategically extend our tenure at our project sites. 
 Our projects provide our landfill and dairy farm partners a solution to monetize biogas from their sites, support their regulatory compliance and provide them with environmental services. We have had working relationships with Republic Services since 1986 and with Waste Management since 2004 and we enable monetization of their biogas while maintaining regulatory compliance. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our extensive experience across a variety of commercialized beneficial uses of processed biogas, including pipeline quality natural gas, power generation and boiler fuel gas products. To date, we have not had any fuel supply agreement terminated by any site partner once we have established a facility on the site, which we believe serves as evidence of our operational expertise, reliability and consistent value delivered to our site partners. The table below is a summary of the expiration periods of those agreements.

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of our RNG projects in development has a contract length of 20 years from commencement of commercial operation, except for Pico, which has a contract length of 20 years from the date of the fuel supply agreement. Our fuel supply agreement expiration dates account for contract extensions at our option. We are consistently reviewing and pursuing extensions for all of our fuel supply agreements well before their expirations and for future agreements, we continue to target contracts with expirations of 20 years from commencement of operation with options for extension. 
 Customers 
 Our customers for RNG and RINs typically include large, long-term owner-operators of landfills and livestock farms, local utilities, and large refiners in the natural gas and refining sectors. Royalty structures included in our agreements, as well as the large size of our counterparties, limit their credit risk. For 2020, our sales to Royal Dutch Shell plc represented approximately 14.1% of our operating revenues. We sell RNG and Environmental Attributes to Royal Dutch Shell plc at a fixed price, which is supplemented by sharing of incremental revenues from monetization of the Environmental Attributes under a margin sharing agreement. Further, Victory Renewables, LLC and Exxon Mobil each represented approximately 11.3% and 15.1%, 
 
-21- 


  respectively, of our operating revenues in 2020 from the sale of Environmental Attributes. We sell RINs to numerous RIN off-take parties and our largest RIN off-taker as a percentage of revenue can vary year to year given the short-term nature of these contracts. In addition to revenues from sales of RNG and RINs, we also share a portion of our Environmental Attributes with our off-take counterparties as in-kind consideration for the counterparty using our RNG as a transportation fuel. 
 Our customers for electricity typically include investor-owned and municipal electricity utilities. For the sale of Renewable Electricity and RECs, the City of Anaheim represented approximately 14.4% of our operating revenues in 2020. These sales occurred under a PPA between us and the City of Anaheim, in which electricity and RECs are sold at fixed prices. By the end of 2020, we converted 100% of the monetization of our Renewable Electricity production and Environmental Attributes under fixed-price agreements. For our electricity sales, all of our customers with whom we have off-take agreements are investment-grade entities with low credit risk. 
 No other single customer represented more than 10% of our total 2020 operating revenues. 
 Suppliers and Equipment Vendors 
 We use a variety of technological means to operate facilities that produce RNG and electricity from raw biogas collected from landfills and digesters. This affords Montauk experience with substantially all major vendors in the sector, and technical expertise in numerous technologies. 
 The major technologies used by our projects for gas processing include solvent scrubbing PSA, and membrane separation. For electricity generation, we use reciprocating engines and gas turbines. 
 We source equipment from a variety of major suppliers with specialties in each technology. We enter into written ordinary-course agreements with suppliers to obtain industry-standard equipment for use in our operations. The contracts generally do not include any intellectual property rights other than for the intended use of the equipment. Membrane separation equipment is primarily provided by UOP and Air Liquide. PSA equipment is primarily provided by Xebec, Air Products, and BioFerm. Solvent scrubbing is primarily provided by Selexol. RNG ancillary constituent removal is done using equipment provided by Iron Sponge, MV Technologies, Thiopaq, Guild Associates, and PSB Industries. Electricity generation equipment is provided by Solar Turbines, CAT, and Jenbacher. 
 We have made substantial investments in a centralized Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system (Microsoft Dynamics) to better integrate operations across our projects. This system centralizes maintenance operations across all of our projects. Our proactive approach to maintenance, corrective maintenance, root cause analysis, failure reporting, project management, and budgeting are all completed using the ERP system. 
 Competition 
 There are a number of other companies operating in the renewable energy and waste-to-energy space, ranging from other project developers to service or equipment providers. 
 Our primary competition is from other companies or solutions for access to biogas from waste. Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect on the competitive landscape and our relative ability to continue to generate revenues and cash flows. We believe that our status as one of the largest operators of LFG-to-RNG projects, our 30-year track record of operating and developing projects, and our deep relationships with some of the largest landfill owners and dairy farms in the country position us very well to continue to operate and grow our portfolio, and respond to competitive pressures. We have demonstrated a track record of strategic flexibility across our 30-year history which has allowed us to pivot towards projects and markets that we believe deliver optimal returns and stockholder value in response to changes in market, regulatory and competitive pressures. 
 
-22- 


 The biogas market is heavily fragmented. We believe our size relative to many other LFG companies and our capital structure puts us in a strong position to compete for new project development opportunities or acquisitions of existing projects. However, competition for such opportunities, including the prices being offered for fuel supply, will impact the expected profitability of projects to us, and may make projects unsuitable to pursue. Likewise, prices being offered by our competitors for fuel supply may increase the royalty rates that we pay under our fuel supply agreements when such agreements expire and need to be renewed or when expansion opportunities present themselves at the landfills where our projects currently operate. It is also possible that more landfill owners may seek to install their own LFG projects on their sites, which would reduce the number of opportunities for us to develop new projects. Our overall size, reputation, access to capital, experience and decades of proven execution on LFG project development and operation leave us well-positioned to compete with other companies in our industry. 
 We are aware of several competitors in the United States that have a similar business model to our own, including Aria Energy and Morrow Renewables, as well as companies with biogas-to-energy facilities as a segment or subsidiary of their operations, including DTE and Ameresco. In addition, certain landfill operators such as Waste Management have also chosen to selectively pursue biogas conversion projects at their sites. 
 Governmental Regulation 
 Each of our projects is subject to federal, state and local air quality, solid waste, and water quality regulations and permitting requirements. Specific construction and operating permit requirements may differ among states. Specific permits we frequently must obtain when developing our projects include: air permits, nonhazardous waste management permits, pollutant discharge elimination permits, and beneficial use permits. Our existing projects must also maintain compliance with relevant federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements. 
 Our RNG projects are subject to federal RFS program regulations, including the EPACT 2005 and EISA. The EPA administers the RFS program with volume requirements for several categories of renewable fuels. The EPAs RFS regulations establish rules for fuel supplied and administer the RIN system for compliance, trading credits and rules for waivers. The EPA calculates a blending standard for each year based on estimates of gasoline usage from the Department of Energys Energy Information Agency. Separate quotas and blending requirements are determined for cellulosic biofuels, BBD, advanced biofuels and total renewable fuel. Further, we are required to register each RNG project with the EPA and relevant state regulatory agencies. We qualify our RINs through a voluntary Quality Assurance Plan, which typically takes from three to five months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. Further, we typically make a large investment in the project prior to receiving the regulatory approval and RIN qualification. In addition to registering each RNG project, we are subject to quarterly audits under the Quality Assurance Plan of our projects to validate our qualification. 
 Our RNG projects are also subject to state renewable fuel standard regulations. The CA LCFS program requires producers of petroleum-based fuels to reduce the CI of their products, beginning with a quarter of a percent in 2011 a 10% total reduction in 2020, and a 20% total reduction in 2030. Petroleum importers, refiners and wholesalers can either develop their own low-carbon fuel products, or buy CA LCFS credits from other companies that develop and sell low-carbon alternative fuels, such as biofuels, electricity, natural gas or hydrogen. We are subject to a qualification process similar to that for RINs, including verification of CI levels and other requirements, currently exists for CA LCFS credits. 
 The CAA regulates emissions of pollutants to protect the environment and public health and contains provisions for New Source Review (NSR) permits and Title V permits. New biogas projects may be required to obtain construction permits under the NSR program. The combustion of biogas results in emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting 
 
-23- 


  requirements for these emissions. Requirements vary for control of these emissions, depending on local air quality. Applicability of the NSR permitting requirements will depend on the level of emissions resulting from the technology used and the projects location. Many biogas projects must obtain operating permits that satisfy Title V of the 1990 CAA Amendments. The operating permit describes the emission limits and operating conditions that a facility must satisfy and specifies the reporting requirements that a facility must meet to show compliance with all applicable air pollution regulations. A Title V operating permit must be renewed every five years. Even when a biogas project does not require a Title V permit, the project may be subject to other federal, state and/or local air quality regulations and permits. 
 In addition, our operations and the operations of the landfills at which we operate may be subject to New Source Performance Standards and emissions guidelines, pursuant to the CAA, applicable to municipal solid waste landfills and to oil and gas facilities. Among other things, these regulations are designed to address the emission of methane, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere. 
 Before an RNG project can be developed, all Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle D requirements (requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management) must be satisfied. In particular, methane is explosive in certain concentrations and poses a hazard if it migrates beyond the project boundary. Biogas collection systems must meet RCRA Subtitle D standards for gas control. RNG projects may be subject to other federal, state and local regulations that impose requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management. 
 Certain biogas projects may be subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment located at these projects and provide training to employees on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control laws. At such projects, we may be required to develop spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans to memorialize our preparation and response plans and to update them on a regular basis. 
 Our operations may result in liability for hazardous substances or other materials placed into soil or groundwater. Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or other federal, state or local laws governing the investigation and cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous substances, we may be required to investigate and/or remediate soil and groundwater contamination at our projects, contiguous and adjacent properties and other properties owned and/or operated by third parties. 
 Additionally, biogas projects may need to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits if wastewater is discharged directly to a receiving water body. If wastewater is discharged to a local sewer system, biogas projects may need to obtain an industrial wastewater permit from a local regulatory authority for discharges to a Publicly Owned Treatment Works. The authority to issue these permits may be delegated to state or local governments by the EPA. The permits, which typically last five years, limit the quantity and concentration of pollutants that may be discharged. Permits may require wastewater treatment or impose other operating conditions to ensure compliance with the limits. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. 
 FERC 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce pursuant to its regulatory authority under the FPA. FERC also regulates certain natural gas transportation and storage facilities and services, and regulates the rates and terms of service for natural gas transportation in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act. 
 With respect to electricity transmission and sales, FERCs jurisdiction includes, among other things, authority over the rates, charges and other terms for the sale of electricity at wholesale by public utilities (entities 
 
-24- 


  that own or operate projects subject to FERC jurisdiction) and for transmission services. With respect to its regulation of the transmission of electricity, FERC requires transmission providers to provide open access transmission services, which supports the development of competitive markets by assuring nondiscriminatory access to the transmission grid. FERC has also encouraged the formation of RTOs to allow greater access to transmission services and certain competitive wholesale markets administered by ISOs and RTOs. 
 In 2005, the U.S. federal government enacted the EPACT 2005 conferring new authority for FERC to act to limit wholesale market power if required and strengthening FERCs civil penalty authority (including the power to assess fines of up to $1.0 million per day per violation), and adding certain disclosure requirements. EPACT 2005 also directed FERC to develop regulations to promote the development of transmission infrastructure, which provides incentives for transmitting utilities to serve renewable energy projects and expanded and extended the availability of U.S. federal tax credits to a variety of renewable energy technologies, including wind power. EPACT 2005s market conduct, penalty and enforcement provisions also apply to fraud and certain other misconduct in the natural gas sector. 
 Qualifying Facilities 
 PURPA established a class of generating facilities that would receive special rate and regulatory treatment, termed qualifying facilities (QFs). There are two categories of QFs: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. A small power production facility is a generating facility of 80 MW or less whose primary energy source is hydro, wind, solar, biomass, waste, or geothermal. A cogeneration facility is a generating facility that produces electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy. QFs are generally subject to reduced regulatory requirements. Small power production facilities up to 20 MW are exempt from rate regulation under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. Each of our three Renewable Electricity projects has been certified as a QF by FERC. 
 In addition, PUHCA provides FERC and state regulatory commissions with access to the books and records of holding companies and other companies in holding company systems. It also provides for the review of certain costs. Companies that are holding companies under PUHCA solely with respect to one or more exempt wholesale generators, QFs or foreign utilities are exempt from these PUHCA books and records requirements. 
 State Utility Regulation 
 While federal law provides the utility regulatory framework for our sales of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce, there are also important areas in which state regulatory control over traditional public utilities that fall under state jurisdiction may have an effect on our projects. For example, the regulated electricity utility buyers of electricity from our projects are generally required to seek state public utility commission approval for the pass through in retail rates of costs associated with PPAs entered into with a wholesale seller. Certain states, such as New York, regulate the acquisition, divestiture, and transfer of some wholesale power projects and financing activities by the owners of such projects. California, which is one of our markets, requires compliance with certain operations and maintenance reporting requirements for wholesale generators. In addition, states and other local agencies require a variety of environmental and other permits. 
 State law governs whether an independent generator or power marketer can sell retail electricity in that state, and whether gas can be sold by an entity other than a traditional, state-franchised gas utility. Some states, such as Florida, prohibit most sales of retail electricity except by the states franchised utilities. In other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, an independent generator may sometimes sell retail electricity power to a co-located or adjacent business customer, and a gas supplier can sometimes make on-premises or adjacent-premises gas deliveries to a single plant or customer. Some states, such as Massachusetts and New York, permit retail power and gas marketers to use the facilities of the states franchised utilities to sell power and/or gas to retail customers as competitors of the utilities.

 Independent System Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations 
 The bulk electricity transmission system and the electricity markets in several geographic regions of the U.S. are operated by FERC-regulated ISOs and RTOs. Each of the ISOs/RTOs established the market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules to which its market participants are subject. There is also a separate ISO in an entirely intrastate market in a portion of Texas that is not directly subject to FERC regulation under the FPA. 
 ISO/RTO market participants include traditional utilities that own transmission and distribution facilities and sell power to retail customers; transmission and distribution utilities within an ISO/RTO market turn control over their facilities over to the ISO/RTO. ISO/RTO market participants also include independent generating companies that produce and sell electricity to other market participants who in turn typically re-sell the electricity; municipal and cooperative utilities that distribute and sell electricity to customers in their service territories; power management businesses that engage in load reduction and provide power management contract services; and power marketers that engage in power trading and re-sales from generation assets owned or operated by others. 
 Each ISO/RTO provides transmission service over the facilities of the ISO/RTOs member utilities that the ISO/RTO controls but does not own, and operates the wholesale power sales markets in the ISO/RTO region. The ISOs/RTOs work with their members and stakeholders to develop their own market rules, market clearing practices, pricing rules including floors and ceilings on electricity prices, and establish eligibility requirements for market participation, subject to review and approval by FERC. Bulk power transmission within the ISO/RTO regional markets is available only from the ISOs/RTOs acting on behalf of transmission-owning utilities. 
 RNG Production and Sale 
 Our projects typically convert biogas to RNG for sale as a fuel product. FERC regulates the natural gas pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce, and specifies or approves a gas pipelines tariff that sets the rates, terms and conditions, gas quality, and other requirements applicable to transportation of natural gas on the pipelines, including shipping RNG. Our sites are not permitted, and may not be physically able, to deliver RNG to a FERC-regulated pipeline unless the pipelines receipt of the gas is consistent with the standards adopted in the pipelines FERC tariff. State regulators determine whether RNG may be purchased by the states local gas utilities, and whether a site operator may directly sell gas to a retail, or direct end-use, customer. Purely local gas sales not utilizing FERC-regulated or certificated facilities are typically not subject to FERC gas regulation. The local distribution of gas to end-use customers by a state-regulated gas utility is also typically outside the scope of FERCs gas regulatory jurisdiction. The opening and operation of a landfill or dairy farm that is expected to produce gas does not ordinarily require a FERC certificate or the acceptance by FERC of a gas tariff. 
 Future Regulations 
 The regulations that are applicable to our projects vary according to the type of energy being produced and the jurisdiction of the facility. As part of our growth strategy, we are looking to grow by pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. Such opportunities may exist in jurisdictions where we have no current operations and, as such, we may become exposed to different regulations for which we have no experience. Some states periodically revisit their regulation of electricity and gas sales. Other states, such as South Carolina and Florida, have adhered to traditional exclusive franchise practices, and in these and other states most electricity and gas customers may receive service only from a utility that holds an exclusive geographic franchise to provide service at that customers location. In some states that have experienced energy price hikes or market volatility, such as New York and California, investments in expanding facilities or buying or building additional facilities may be subject to changing regulatory requirements that may encourage competitive market entry.

 Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on Our Business 
 Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations on the international, federal, state and local levels, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to our industry. Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations. 
 We believe that our operations comply in all material respect with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in our industry. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with international, federal and state environmental requirements. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 We have approximately 115 full time professionals as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. 
 The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain talented individuals at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed and maintain key recruitment and retention strategies. These include competitive salary structures, including bonus compensation programs, and competitive benefits policies, including paid time off for vacations, sick leave and holidays, short-term and long-term disability coverage, group term life insurance, tuition reimbursement for job-related education and training, and various retirement savings and incentive plans. 
 Safety of our personnel is a core value of Montauk and maintaining a safe work environment is critical to an energy companys ability to attract and retain employees. As described in Risk Factors, to support the health and safety of our employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enhanced our safety protocols by arranging shifts at facilities to stagger employees to ensure social distancing, implemented more extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both facilities and office spaces, incorporated temperature checks, required facial covering, instituted employee and visitor fitness questionnaires, restricted corporate travel and visitor access to sites and implemented work-from-home and work-flex initiatives for certain employees. We also established the IDRC to lead the development and implementation of such policies and to oversee the Companys response to any infectious disease event. See Our StrengthsEnvironmental, Health and Safety and Compliance Leadership for a description of our employee-level EHS programs. 
 Segments and Geographic Information
