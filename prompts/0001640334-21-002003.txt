ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OUR COMPANY

NAMI Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) conducts its operations through its controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS Mining Corp. Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (hereinafter referred to as “SBS”). SBS, founded on August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in trading activities for certain mineral ores and mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.
OUR CORPORATE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2012. We established November 30 as our fiscal year-end. On July 4, 2018, we changed our fiscal year-end to June 30. We were originally developing a built-in safe with a combination lock that could store personal and/or valuable items inside of backpacks, carry-on luggage, and suitcases. Since our inception and until the acquisition of SBS, we were a development stage company without significant assets or revenue.

On October 31, 2016, a change in control occurred because the Company’s largest shareholder sold 60,750,000 shares of our common stock to the Company’s current Chairman, Ong Tee Keat, an individual residing in Malaysia, which represented 60.22% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at that time. Such 60,750,000 shares sold represented all of the shares of the Company’s common stock owned by prior shareholder.

On October 31, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Nevada SOS”) whereby we amended our Articles of Incorporation by (a) increasing the authorized number of shares of common stock from 200 million to 5 billion; and (b) increasing all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of seven (7) shares for every one (1) share issued and outstanding. Our Board and shareholders approved this amendment on October 26, 2016.

Prior to November 3, 2016, we operated our business under the name “Pack Fuerte, Inc.” On November 3, 2016, Pack Fuerte, Inc. filed Articles of Merger, pursuant to the Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq., with the Nevada SOS. The Articles set forth the terms and conditions under which we entered into a statutory merger with our wholly owned subsidiary, NAMI Corp., with Pack Fuerte, Inc. as the merging corporation and NAMI Corp. as the surviving corporation. Thereafter we have operated under the name NAMI Corp.

Acquisition of SBS

On July 12, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of SBS from GMCI Corp (“GMCI”) in exchange for the issuance of a total of 720,802,346 shares of our common stock to GMCI (the “SBS Acquisition” or “Share Exchange”). As a result of the SBS acquisition, SBS became our wholly owned subsidiary; and the former SBS Shareholder, GMCI, became our controlling stockholder. The share exchange transaction was treated as a recapitalization, with SBS as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party for accounting purposes. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of SBS. 

Immediately prior to the Share Exchange, GMCI owned all the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. As a result of our acquisition of SBS, we now own all the issued and outstanding capital stock of SBS. After the closing of the Share Exchange, we conduct our operations through our controlled, consolidated subsidiary SBS. SBS is primarily engaged in mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.

On July 4, 2018, our Board approved changing the fiscal year-end of the Company from November 30 to June 30 as a result of the SBS Acquisition.

On July 19, 2018, we were notified that the Board of GMCI deemed it to be in the best interests of GMCI and its stockholders for GMCI to approve and declare a dividend of restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. to the stockholders of GMCI, on a pro rata basis, determined in accordance with the number of shares of capital stock of GMCI held by such stockholders, thereby transferring ownership of 100% of the outstanding restrictive shares of NAMI Corp. owned by GMCI to the stockholders of GMCI (collectively, the “Nami Stock Dividend”). The Nami Stock Dividend was completed on August 21, 2018.

Filing of S-1 Registration Statement for our Selling Shareholders

On November 13, 2018, the Company filed a S-1 Registration Statement to register for the sale of up to 322,388,472 shares of our common stock by persons who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the Nami Stock Dividend and by persons who purchased shares of our common stock in private placements that we effected from April to September 2017 (the “Private Investors”). The recipients of the Nami Stock Dividend and the Private Investors are referred to in this annual report as the “selling stockholders”. The selling stockholders may sell common stock from time to time in the principal market on which the stock will be traded at the prevailing market price or in negotiated transactions. With respect to shares of our common stock that may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders, we will receive no proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to such offering. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) declared the effectiveness of the resale S-1 Registration Statement on November 26, 2018. 
Temporary Business Interruptions Caused by Covid-19

In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China that has since spread to all regions of the world. The outbreak was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused and continue to disrupt business, the financial markets, and economies globally. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in certain negative impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The government of Malaysia implemented a Moving Control Order (“MCO”) active from March 2020 until July 2020 that caused us to suspend business operations. The MCO continues to be extended on a periodic basis and to impact our operations and ability to generate revenue. 

The pandemic is an ongoing world issue, and the ultimate magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. Uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of a global public health crisis can cause instability in the global markets and economies, affecting our business in a multitude of ways and in varying magnitudes. Although we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, if this global health threat persists, it could adversely affect:


· | Global demand for bauxite, sea sand and river sand, negatively impacting our ability to generate cash flows from operations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our operations, including causing interruptions, reductions, or closures of our operations, due to decreased demand for our products, government regulations and/or fewer workers due to illness or public health restrictions;
· | Commercial sustainability of key vendors or transportation disruptions within our supply chain, which could result in higher inventory costs and/or inability to obtain key raw materials or fulfill customer orders; and 
· | Global financial and credit markets and our ability to obtain additional credit or financing upon acceptable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition. 


Further or prolonged deterioration of adverse conditions could continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The situation surrounding COVID-19 is constantly evolving, and given its inherent uncertainty, we expect that the pandemic will continue to cause instability in the global markets and economies in the near term, particularly if there is a continued increase in COVID-19 cases globally and/or in the locations in which the Company operates. The duration and magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the emergence of new variants, increased infection rates in the areas in which we operate, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts in the markets where we operate, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers, and joint venture partners. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had an may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

OVERVIEW

SBS, founded in August 14, 2008, is a Malaysian corporation primarily engaged in bauxite financing and trading, as well as mining and exploration of properties located in Malaysia.
SBS’ executive offices are located at No 1, 1st Floor, Lorong Sekilau 1, Bukit Sekilau, 25200 Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur, Malaysia.

On March 26, 2015, GMCI entered into a share exchange agreement (the “GMCI Agreement”) with all of the original shareholders of SBS (the “SBS Original Shareholders”). Pursuant to the GMCI Agreement, GMCI acquired 600,000 shares of capital stock of SBS (the “Original SBS Shares”) from the SBS Original Shareholders and in exchange issued 500,000,000 restricted shares of GMCI’s common stock to the SBS Original Shareholders.

The 600,000 Original SBS Shares constituted all of the issued and outstanding shares of SBS and were held by a total of three (3) shareholders, including GMCI’s sole director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lok Khing Ming. Mr. Lok owned ten percent (10%) of the Original SBS Shares, or 60,000 shares. The remaining shares were owned by Mr. Liew Chin Loong (90,000 shares, or 15% of the Original SBS Shares), who resides in Malaysia and LYF & Son Realty Sdn. Bhd. (450,000 shares, or 75% of the Original SBS Shares), a Malaysian corporation. Pursuant to the GMCI Agreement, Mr. Lok received 50 million shares of GMCI’s common stock; Mr. Liew received 75 million shares of GMCI’s common stock; and LYF & Son Realty Sdn. Bhd. received 375 million shares of GMCI’s common stock. As a result of the GMCI Agreement, SBS became a wholly owned subsidiary of GMCI; and GMCI carried on the business of SBS as its primary business. The closing of the GMCI Agreement occurred on April 23, 2015.

In August 2018, SBS created a new class of preferred equity, designated as the “12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares,” in its attempt to raise capital for business expansion and exploration of mining activities. SBS authorized the issuance of up to 50 million shares of the newly created class of preferred stock at an issue price of RM 1.0 per share. This new preferred equity carries a cumulative 12% preferred dividend, payable on a quarterly basis, based on the issue price of the preferred shares (the “Preferred Dividend”). The Preferred Dividend will have priority over any payment of dividends on the common shares of SBS. The preferred shares shall be redeemed by SBS at the “Redemption Price.” The Redemption Price for each share shall be an amount of shares of NAMI Corp., equal to the issue price of the preferred shares, plus the unpaid Preferred Dividends. SBS shall redeem the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares on the second anniversary of their issuing date. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SBS, the holders of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares, shall be entitled to have the assets available for distribution applied first to pay them an amount equal to the issue price, plus all unpaid Preferred Dividends. If SBS fails to effect the redemption of the preferred shares 45 business days after the second anniversary of the issuing date (the “Redemption Date”), then the holders of the preferred shares shall be entitled to deal with such shares in any manner. Failure by SBS to redeem any of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares on the Redemption Date will be regarded as a potential default by SBS of the terms of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares. The holders of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares shall have no voting rights, except: (i) upon any resolution put forth when the Preferred Dividends remain in arrears and unpaid; (ii) upon any resolution that varies the rights of the preferred shares; (iii) upon any resolution for the winding up of SBS; (iii) upon any resolution to approve a capital reduction, repayment or distribution of SBS; (iv) upon any proposal to effect a scheme of arrangement; and (v) as required by law. On June 30, 2020, dividends in arrears totaled $3,280 (MYR 14,000) per share. As of the date of this report, dividends in arrears total $0.0136 (MYR 0.0579) per Series A Preferred share.

In August 2018, SBS commenced a capital raise of up to RM 50,000,000 (approximately USD 12.4 million) by offering shares of SBS’12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares at a price of RM1.00 per share (the “12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares Offering”). The 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering was closed on February 28, 2019. During the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, preferred dividends of $5,861 (RM25,200) and $6,097 (RM25,200), respectively, were distributed to the holders of the preferred shares.

In August 2018, the Company received approximately $59,530 (MYR 240,000) in the first subscription of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering. The Company received approximately $8,878 (MYR 40,000) in the second subscription of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares offering.

As of June 30, 2020, SBS had 280,000 shares of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares outstanding which are redeemable for NAMI Corp. common shares. As of the date of this report 280,000 shares of 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares remain outstanding. To redeem such shares, SBS plans to pay the Redemption Price by purchasing shares of Nami Corp. directly from certain members of the board of directors of SBS, using proceeds from operating cash flows and at a discounted price. As of the date of this report, no shares of Nami Corp. have been transferred to the holders of the preferred shares.

In August 2020, the two-year term to redeem all of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares for the Redemption Price, to be paid in shares of Nami Corp. lapsed. The Company was unable to redeem the preferred shares due to a complete halt of operations in compliance with a Movement Control Order issued by the Malaysian government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Holders of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares received two letters from SBS informing them that operations had been halted; and that scheduled dividend payments and the redemption of shares had to be delayed due to the effects of Covid-19. Both letters proposed a new dividend payment schedule and redemption date. Failure to redeem the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares constitutes a potential default under the agreements executed between SBS and the holders of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares, permitting such holders to take action to demand the completion of such redemption or to revoke their subscription of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares; and claim all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the rescission of their investment; including the Redemption Price. As of the date of this report, we have not been notified of the occurrence and continuation of an event of default by the Company, under the terms of the subscription agreement executed between SBS and the holders of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares; and we are not aware of any actions that have been taken against us by the holders of the 12% Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares.

Products and Suppliers 

Bauxite Financing 

Until 2016, SBS was focused on exploration activities in order to develop properties for producing metal ores, such as iron ore, bauxite and tin ore. SBS held licenses to two (2) properties located in Malaysia, on which it was prospecting to mine iron ore. The total mining area included as part of those two (2) licenses consisted of 100 hectares (247 acres). When the GMCI Agreement was concluded, the market price per delivered dry tonne of iron ore was between $45 and $65. SBS believed that there would be a downward trend for iron ore prices and eventually the market price fell below $45 in December 2015. Accordingly, SBS commenced a plan to move into financing bauxite mining and trading in China. In January 2016, SBS’ two (2) licenses expired; and because of the lack of economic viability in the marketing of iron ore, management determined not to renew these licenses upon expiration. 

SBS provides financing for the acquisition, stockpiling storage, exporting and shipment of bauxite ore from Malaysia. Currently, SBS has provided funding to Sincere Pacific Mining (M) Sdn. Bhd. (“Sincere Pacific”) to purchase and sell and export bauxite through a verbal agreement. Sincere Pacific is considered a related party as Mr. Liew Chin Loong, a director and officer of SBS, is also a fifty percent (50%) owner and a director of Sincere Pacific.

SBS and Sincere Pacific have verbally agreed to work in partnership to acquire and arrange transport for stockpiled bauxite shipments to Mainland China. Services required for the loading, processing and transport of bauxite from mine sites to the port will be provided by SBS and Sincere Pacific directly. Sincere Pacific has agreed to manage all labor, processing, transport and export of the ore until such time as the parties have concluded a total of seven (7) shipments.

Sincere Pacific holds a special permit from the government of Malaysia that allows it to hold up to 1.8 million metric tonnes (all tonnes referred to herein are metric) of bauxite stockpile for shipment at Felda Bukit Goh, Kuantan. This permit has no expiration date. Sincere Pacific and SBS intend to conclude approximately seven (7) shipments under this permit. As of June 30, 2020, the two parties have concluded five (5) shipments. The remaining two shipments have not been concluded and do not have a set date for shipping because the Malaysian government is still finalizing all the procedures and regulations for exporting bauxite. On March 22, 2018, Sincere Pacific obtained an additional bauxite export license for a total tonnage of 124,160.67 metric tonnes. The permit expired on April 30, 2018. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the verbal agreement in the year ended June 30, 2020. Sincere Pacific acquires or purchases bauxite from multiple sources in Malaysia for selling the ore to customers in China.

Upon purchasing bauxite in Malaysia, Sincere Pacific processes the ore in its facilities, then stockpiles the ore pending shipment. Each shipment of bauxite consists of up to 55,000 metric tonnes. SBS does not take physical possession of the minerals at any time. It has been verbally agreed between Sincere Pacific and SBS that SBS, in return for providing exporting financing, shall receive a commission based on the gross amount of washed bauxite tonnage of up to 20,000 metric tonnes per shipment. Thereafter, if successful, the two parties will enter a formal agreement with respect to further shipments under newly negotiated terms. It is anticipated by our management team that the sales price obtained by Sincere Pacific for unwashed bauxite could gross a total of up to USD $24.50 to USD $26.00 per dry and delivered metric tonne, free on board stowed and trimmed, subject to certain penalties or bonus based on the percentage of certain mineral compounds present (primarily aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide). Sincere Pacific issues payment to SBS upon successful conclusion of shipments, at an agreed USD $1.00 per delivered dry tonne, net any applicable fees such as storage, etc. The parties intend to formalize a written agreement for future mineral trading activities following successful conclusion of approximately seven (7) shipments whereby we hope that SBS will receive commissions on up to 140,000 gross tonnes. As of the date of this report, no formalized written agreement has been completed.

However, the price at which Sincere Pacific sells a shipment of bauxite is subject to negotiation and current market prices. Therefore, this average net income of USD$1.00 per tonne payable to SBS is subject to adjustment and possible volatility.

To date, Sincere Pacific has completed five (5) shipments of bauxite and SBS has provided Sincere Pacific with $614,226 (RM$2,504,769) of financing used towards a portion of these shipments. Of the total financing advanced by SBS, $186,744 (RM$800,000) has been repaid by Sincere Pacific as of the date of this filing. Through June 30, 2018, SBS has received revenue of $84,271 (RM$350,306) in commissions from Sincere Pacific from its bauxite trading operations. No sales were made by Sincere Pacific under the agreement in the year ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and therefore no commissions were received by the Company during the year ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020. 

Sea Sand Mining 

On August 30, 2017, SBS entered into an agreement with JHW Holdings Sdn. Bhd. (“JHW”), whereby JHW applied for and obtain a three (3) year mining concession from the Malaysian government to mine and dredge sea sand on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, effective beginning in January 2019, . JHW was first granted a concession with an area of 1,113km², which was later amended and reduced to 383km². The final approved area is 20.48km² within the jurisdiction of the state of Terengganu, Malaysia (the “Area”). Pursuant to the agreement, JHW was responsible for carrying out and submitting to the relevant authorities all necessary study reports, including, but not limited to, Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) reports and feasibility and hydraulic studies with respect to the Area to obtain approval for the sea sand mining and dredging license (the “Final Approval”). SBS was responsible for bearing all costs and expenses incurred with respect to such application, and for providing all the required technical assistance with obtaining the concession licenses. In exchange for covering all costs and expenses in connection with the obtainment of the Final Approval, JHW granted SBS the exclusive right to develop, carry out and operate all mining and extraction activities in the Area, and to manage all matters related to the operation and extraction of sea sand, either by itself or by a nominee. Gross profits from operations of the mining activities in the Area shall be allocated 25% to JHW and 75% to SBS pursuant to the terms of the agreement. In addition, the SBS was required to prepay an advance of MYR 500,000 of future net incomes to JHW. As of June 30, 2019, SBS had paid MYR 250,000 (approximately $60,000 USD) to JHW, the residual MYR 250,000, remain outstanding and will be paid once operations commence.

SBS and JHW fulfilled all regulatory requirements and obtained the necessary approvals from all governmental agencies, including Department of Environment (“DOE”) (Jabatan Alam Sekitar), Department of Mineral and Geoscience Malaysia (“JMG”) (Jabatan Mineral dan Geosains Malaysia) and all 13 agencies under the jurisdiction of the state and federal governments of Malaysia for the three (3) year concession in January 2019.

The Final Approval of the sea sand mining and dredging license was obtained on January 10, 2019. SBS is now ready to begin its sea sand mining operation. The license expires on January 9, 2022; however, JHW has commenced the license renewal application, the receipt of which was acknowledged on June 29, 2021 by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.

On December 30, 2020, SBS received an acceptance letter from Royal Resources Pte Ltd in connection with an offer to supply sea sand to the Shenzhen-Hainan reclamation project in China. The estimated value of the order is USD 37,500,000. The parties are in the process of finalizing the definitive supply agreement. SBS and JHW are now setting up the preparation for the sand mining operation, in compliance to the mining license stringent rules and regulation. The first batch of shipments of sea sand is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2021.

The offshore sea sand concession site is located on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, occupying an area spanning 20.57km², within the jurisdiction of the state of Terengganu, Malaysia.

The general location of the sea sand mining area is provided in the map below. 


Entry into Letter of Intent of Granite Mining Business

On January 17, 2019, we entered into a Letter of Intent with Pembinaan Kaya Hebat Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian corporation engaged in granite mining business (“PKH”), for the acquisition by us of up to one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of PKH at its fair market value (the “PKH Acquisition”). The completion of the PKH Acquisition is subject to various conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, negotiating and executing a form of purchase agreement that is acceptable to both parties, approval of the financial statements of both parties’ boards of directors, and fair market valuation of PKH. In the event that we are able to complete the PKH Acquisition, we intend to operate PKH as a wholly owned subsidiary or a majority-owned subsidiary. As of the date of this report, the PKH acquisition is till under negotiations. If the PKH acquisition is completed, it will trigger additional disclosure in subsequent reports and our financial statements. 

NAMI Corp. aspires to become a global diversified mining company and is actively engaged in plans to expand by communicating with prospective mining businesses.

River Sand Mining

On September 6, 2019, SBS entered into a mining agreement with Wan Ismail bin Wan Ahmad (the “Donor”) pursuant to which the Donor granted to SBS the sole and exclusive rights to mine for river sand and other materials from a 1.9040 hectare (4.7 acre) plot of land located at Kampung Tiram, district of Kuala Kuantan, Kuantan, Malaysia (the “Concession”) for which the Donor had received a lease license from the State Government of Pahang. SBS shall pay the Donor a fixed monthly rate for the sole and exclusive rights to mine the Concession.

With the grant of the sole and exclusive rights of the aforementioned mining right for river sand, the Company expands its current business portfolio to river sand mining and trading. Meanwhile, the Company plans to continue acquiring strategic mining concessions to enhance its river sand mining division.

OUR INDUSTRY

Bauxite Trading 

In 2015, Malaysia exported 24.3 million tonnes, resulting in $1.1 billion of revenue to exporters. China accounted for 99% of Malaysia’s export of bauxite. In 2016, the government of Malaysia banned all bauxite mining activities due to environmental concerns and ordered the clearing of the country’s stockpiled inventory of bauxite, requiring all exports to be done pursuant to approved permits issued by the Malaysian government (“Approved Permits”).2 As a result, Malaysia exported just 7.4 million metric tonnes of bauxite in 2016. The ban on the mining of bauxite in Malaysia lasted for three years and was finally lifted in April 2019. The total approximate amount of exported bauxite in 2018 decreased significantly to 515,217 tonnes as compared to 822,668 tonnes of bauxite exported in 2017.

Sincere Pacific currently holds an Approved Permit to export bauxite, which ensures the company applies sustainable mining practices to avoid environmental damage. 

Sea Sand Mining 

The process of sea sand mining is extracting sand from the ocean bed with heavy machinery. Then sands are dredged and stored into bunkers or vessels that will be shipped to a buyer’s destination. In commercial businesses, sands are mainly used as construction materials (e.g., brick, concrete, and roads) and for land reclamation (also known as landfills). 

The demand for sea sand has soared globally, mostly for industrial and land reclamation purposes. According to the United Nation Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE), international trades value has increased six-fold in the last 25 years. The Department of Mineral & Geoscience Malaysia reported that out of 36.7 million tonnes of sea sand produced in Malaysia in 2017, 1.5 million tonnes were exported, almost exclusively to Singapore.

On October 3, 2018, Malaysia banned all exports of sea sand due to environmental concerns, to satisfy domestic demand, and to clamp down on illegal sand smuggling. Nowadays, sea sand can only be exported from Malaysia under a specific export Approved Permit. As of the date of this report, our partner, JHW, and one other company are the only two current export Approved Permit holders in Malaysia. Under the terms of JHW’s export Approved Permit, we can export up to 19,640,000m3 of sea sand. JHW applied for and obtained the export Approved Permit on April 9, 2021.

River Sand Mining

River sand can originate from a wide variety of sources such as from decomposed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks; deposits of glacial sands or deposits of ancient sea sands in the form of uplifted or stranded beaches. Sands from rivers are a preferred source.

Apart from Perlis and Melaka, all other states contributed to the production of river sand in 2017. Local demand is expected to come from the revival of mega projects that were halted previously such as the Bandar Malaysia, East Coast Rail Link and Light Rail Transit 3 (“LRT 3”) projects. Bandar Malaysia’s development which occupies the former airport in Sungai Besi is estimated to be 196 hectares in size and will include 10,000 affordable housing units, a people’s park and priority for the use of local content and materials. Completion date is not confirmed yet but development is expected to take 20 years to complete. Tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei have also expressed their interest to set up their ICT centres in Bandar Malaysia. 

Another project that received the green light in April 2019 is the East Coast Rail Link (the “ECRL”). The ECRL is a key railway project consisting of 655 kilometres of railways connecting the eastern coast of Malaysia with the western part of the country. The project is expected to be completed in December 2026. 

COMPETITION

Currently, we do not have any direct competition with respect to the specific properties to which we hold licenses. Sincere Pacific is one of the few holders of Approved Permits in Malaysia to export bauxite. It has little competition in terms of purchasing and exporting bauxite.

In terms of developing our business plan and conducting exploration and later deposit development, we expect to compete for qualified geological and environmental experts to assist us in our exploration of mining prospects, as well as any other consultants, employees and equipment that we may require in order to conduct our operations.

Currently, there is significant competition for financial capital to be deployed in mining and material extraction. Therefore, it is difficult for smaller companies such as us to attract investment for its exploration activities. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to compete for capital funds; and without adequate financial resources, we cannot assure our investors or shareholders that the Company will be able to compete in exploration activities and ultimately in material deposit development, production and sales.

MARKETS, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company and SBS received the sea sand mining and dredging license on January 10, 2019. SBS is now ready to begin its sea sand mining operation. The license expires on January 9, 2022; and we have already commenced the license renewal application process, which was acknowledged on June 29, 2021 by the relevant government authorities.

As license holders, we plan to distribute and sell sea sand to customers from Malaysia’s neighboring countries, such as China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei and Cambodia. Overall, market demand for sand is high. Singapore remains the largest importer of sand for land reclamation purposes, filling the sea along its coast with imported sand. Since 1965, Singapore has expanded its physical size by 25%.3 The Department of Mineral & Geoscience Malaysia reported that out of 36.7 million tonnes of sea sand produced in Malaysia in 2017, 1.5 million tonnes were exported, almost exclusively to Singapore.

In Vietnam, scientists from the Vietnam Institute of Transport Science & Technology (“ITST”) warn that the domestic supply of natural sand is nearing an end and could be depleted by 2022 due to excessive exploitation.4 Furthermore, illegal mining activities in Vietnam have reached epidemic proportions, as reported in 2017 by Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Public Security, Senior Lieutenant General Lê Quý Vương, noting that police had detected more than 4,300 violations in more than 8,000 inspections in the past year.5

In Indonesia, residents are resisting sand mining and the construction of artificial islands because of the potential harm to fish stocks and the environment. Reports describe how locals are mounting fierce resistance against sand mining off the southern tip of Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island and land reclamation in Makassar, which has caused the provincial government to suspend all ongoing activities.6

Cambodia has outlawed sand exports from a coastal region where it has been primarily funneled in huge quantities to Singapore. However, it appears that previous bans had failed to stem the export.7 Furthermore, internal reports from the United Nations questioned Cambodia’s sand exports where UN data showed that Cambodia had exported $752 million worth of sand to Singapore. In spite of such reports of wide-scale exports, Cambodia only reported $5 million worth of trade value exported to Singapore. 8 This large-scale dredging would certainly have an adverse impact on the natural environment and the local communities.

· | The Continental Shelf Act of 1966 (“CSA”) relates to the continental shelf of Malaysia, the exploration thereof and the exploitation of its natural resources. The CSA regulates applications for licenses that permit mining activities on the continental shelf. 
· | The Customs Act 1967 regulates the import and export of goods, with the clearance of import, export and transit of goods coming under the purview of Royal Malaysian Customs Department (“RMCD”). Some products require a license or Approved Permit (“AP”) before importing or exporting. Sand is among the products that need a license or AP to export. As APs are issued by Permit Issuing Agencies (“PIAs”), which are the relevant ministries relating to the products being exported or imported, the AP for sand export is issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.

In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of certain notices, the absence of which, or the inability to obtain, will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.

INSURANCE

Insurance companies in Malaysia offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in Malaysia, we have determined that the risks of interruption, the cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we are subject to risk inherent to our business, including equipment failure, theft, natural disasters, industrial accidents, labor disturbances, business interruptions, property damage, product liability, personal injury and death. Furthermore, if we suffer losses, damages or liabilities, including those caused by natural disasters or other events beyond our control and we are unable to make a claim against a third party, we will be required to bear all such losses from our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
