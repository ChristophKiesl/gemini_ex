Item 1. Business
Overview
GoPro helps the world capture and share itself in immersive and exciting ways. Our cameras, mountable and wearable accessories, and subscription services have generated substantially all of our revenue. We sell our products globally through retailers, distributors and on GoPro.com. 
Our product offerings include the following:
•HERO9 Black is our flagship waterproof camera launched in the Fall of 2020, featuring a 23.6MP sensor that provides stunning 5K video, the highest resolution ever for a HERO camera, 20MP photos and HyperSmooth 3.0 video stabilization. The HERO9 Black camera also features a new front-facing display, a larger rear touch display, an extended battery life, new Power Tools, TimeWarp 3.0, SuperPhoto, live streaming, webcam mode, built-in mounting, cloud connectivity and voice control. HyperSmooth 3.0 is our most advanced stabilization ever and includes in-camera horizon leveling that keeps shots smooth and level. TimeWarp Video 3.0 features Real Speed, which allows users to slow down footage to real speed and capture audio while recording, and Half Speed, which allows users to slow down footage even more for epic slow motion. Webcam Mode enables users to connect their HERO9 Black camera to a computer with the included USB-C cable to use the camera as a 1080p high-definition wide-angle webcam. We also introduced new Power Tools, including HindSight, Scheduled Capture and Duration Capture to help users capture the perfect shot. HindSight allows users to capture and save up to 30 seconds of video before the shutter button is pressed. Scheduled Capture allows users to set up their cameras to automatically capture photos or videos up to 24 hours in advance and Duration Capture allows users to set their HERO9 Black to record for a specified length of time. In addition, we introduced a Max Lens Mod accessory that brings Max HyperSmooth video stabilization and Max SuperView’s ultra wide-angle photo and video to the HERO9 Black camera. We also continue to offer our HERO8 Black, HERO7 Black and HERO7 Silver cameras. Our cameras are compatible with our ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories, and feature automatic uploading capabilities for photos and videos for GoPro subscribers.
•MAX is our 360-degree waterproof camera featuring MAX HyperSmooth image stabilization, 360-degree MAX TimeWarp Video, MAX SuperView, PowerPano, built-in mounting, high-quality audio, live streaming, voice control and a front facing touch display. MAX HyperSmooth provides the highest performance video stabilization yet, while MAX SuperView provides the widest field of view ever from a GoPro camera. PowerPano allows users to capture a 6.2mp, 270-degree panoramic photo with the push of a button and creates an artifact-free shot of action or movement. Our MAX camera features six built-in microphones that allows users to capture immersive 360-degree audio, directional audio for vlogging and the best stereo sound ever from a GoPro.
•GoPro subscription is our subscription service that provides a camera protection plan and enables subscribers to easily access, edit and share content. The GoPro subscription includes unlimited cloud storage supporting source video and photo quality, camera replacement and damage protection, access to a high-quality live streaming service on GoPro.com as well as discounts on GoPro gear, mounts and accessories. Our HERO5 Black and newer cameras can automatically upload photos and videos to a subscriber’s GoPro account at the highest possible quality, while HERO7 Black and newer cameras can also access our live-streaming service.
•GoPro app is a mobile app that allows users to share and edit their photos and videos. In December 2020, we introduced a new feature called Mural, where users can post their favorite shots to a private Mural wall. Mural organizes a user’s favorite photos and videos as “events” and automatically generates a stunning highlight video for each event created. This new app experience is derived from our legacy, free-to-use video editing app, Quik, and can be fully utilized by members of our GoPro subscription service. In 2021, we plan to add powerful new editing features which will enable users of smartphones and other types of cameras to access the new GoPro app experience via a $9.99 annual subscription. As part of our subscription growth efforts, we also plan to migrate users of the legacy Quik app to the new GoPro app over time.
We also offer a full ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories. See Products for additional information. 
We believe our investments in hardware, cloud and mobile solutions have yielded a solid foundational experience for consumers that we will continue to build upon in 2021. 
Our strategy
Helping our consumers capture and share their experiences in immersive and exciting ways is at the core of our business. We are committed to developing solutions that create an easy, seamless experience for consumers to capture, create and share engaging personal content. When consumers use our products and services, they often generate and share content that increases awareness for GoPro, driving a virtuous cycle and a self-reinforcing demand for our products. We believe revenue growth will be driven by the introduction of new cameras, accessories, lifestyle gear, subscription offerings and GoPro app monetization. We also believe new or improved camera features drive a replacement cycle among existing users and attract new users. Consumers can choose between numerous channels to purchase our hardware products, which are sold through GoPro.com, retailers and distributors. In addition, consumers can purchase software products through GoPro.com and via the GoPro app.
We also strive to expand our total addressable market by providing GoPro subscribers with improved benefits and providing a GoPro app experience that we believe addresses widespread pain points associated with using smartphones and GoPro cameras.
To achieve these goals, we aspire to retain employees committed to growing GoPro through great ideas and innovation by leveraging our strong brand recognition, unique culture, competitive compensation and benefits, and our strong commitment to our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging initiatives. Our employees collaborate cross-functionally to help achieve our goals such as continuously improving our GoPro.com site and maintaining our relationships with key retailers and distributors.
Products 
Cameras. We offer a family of flagship cameras, including our cloud connected HERO7 Black, HERO8 Black and HERO9 Black cameras. We also offer MAX, our waterproof 360-degree camera and our HERO7 Silver camera. HERO7 Silver, HERO7 Black, HERO8 Black, HERO9 Black and MAX cameras are durable, waterproof (without a housing), come with select mounting accessories, and have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology, providing connectivity with a mobile device to enable remote control, content viewing, editing and sharing functionality.

Mounts and accessories.  We offer a wide range of mounts and accessories, either bundled with a camera or sold separately, that enhance the functionality and versatility of our products, and enable our consumers to capture their experiences during a variety of activities or moments from different viewpoints. Our equipment-based mounts include three mods, which allows users to transform their HERO9 and HERO8 Black cameras into a production powerhouse. The Media Mod provides an integrated directional microphone, the Light Mod illuminates a scene and the Display Mod allows users to perfectly frame themselves during self-capture. In addition, we offer a Max Lens Mod that brings Max HyperSmooth video stabilization and Max SuperView’s ultra wide-angle photo and video to the HERO9 Black camera. Other equipment-based mounts include helmet, handlebar, roll bar and tripod mounts. Our 3-way mount is a 3-in-1 mount that can be used as a camera grip, extension arm or tripod, and our floating mounts such as the Handler, and Bite Mount + Floaty, allow our cameras to float in water. We also enable consumers to wear mounts on their bodies with the use of our magnetic swivel clip, wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Additionally, we offer spare batteries, dive filters and charging accessories and cables to connect our GoPro cameras to computers, laptops and television monitors. Our accessories expand the features, versatility and convenience of our cameras. 
Lifestyle Gear.  We offer a lifestyle gear lineup that melds our signature design and versatility across an exciting and ultra-functional line of bags, backpacks and cases.
Applications.  We offer mobile, desktop and web applications that provides a complete media workflow for archiving, editing, multi-clip story creation, sharing content on the fly, and enhances direct-to-consumer discovery and purchase experience. In December 2020, we introduced a new feature called Mural in our GoPro app, where users can post their favorite shots to a private Mural wall. Mural organizes a user’s favorite photos and videos as “events” and automatically generates a stunning highlight video for each event created. This new app experience is derived from our legacy, free-to-use video editing app, Quik, and can be fully utilized by members of our GoPro subscription service. In 2021, we plan to add powerful new editing features which will enable users of smartphones and other types of cameras to access the new GoPro app experience via a $9.99 annual subscription. As part of our subscription growth efforts, we also plan to migrate users of the legacy Quik app to the new GoPro app over time.
Services. Our GoPro subscription service offers a range of benefits to our consumers, including a camera protection plan and a platform that enables subscribers to easily access, edit and share content. The GoPro subscription also includes unlimited cloud storage supporting source video and photo quality, camera replacement and damage protection, access to a high-quality live streaming service on GoPro.com as well as discounts on GoPro lifestyle gear, mounts and accessories. Our HERO5 Black and newer cameras can automatically upload photos and videos to a subscriber’s GoPro account at the highest possible quality, while HERO7 Black and newer cameras can access our live-streaming service. We had 761,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2020, which grew 52% sequentially and 145% year-over-year.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced our highest levels of revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season, particularly in the United States and Europe. While we aim to reduce the impact of fourth quarter seasonality on full year performance, timely and effective product introductions and forecasting, whether just prior to the holiday season or otherwise, are critical to our operations and financial performance. 
Segment information and geographic data
We operate as one reportable segment. Financial information about geographic areas is presented in Note 10 Concentrations of risk and geographic information, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and development
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products that inspire our consumers and enhance our brand. We are constantly innovating to deliver better performance, expanded functionality and increased convenience to enhance the appeal of our products. We strive to remain a market leader by consistently introducing innovative products, software and services that offer optimal performance at affordable price points.
We have a user experience-driven approach to product development and our CEO leads product design. By engaging with customers, consumers and opinion leaders in our core markets around the world, our development team strives to introduce meaningful and empowering new features that expand the versatility and performance of our products. We also benefit from input received from our in-house production team, our sponsored athletes and our brand advocates that regularly travel the world capturing content using our products. We believe leveraging this input will help refine our existing products and influence future products that give us a competitive advantage.
Our engineering team supports the development of cameras, related mounts and accessories, firmware and software. Our hardware engineering team is responsible for developing solutions to support the concepts developed by our product team. These core technologies include GoPro’s custom designed system on chip, which allows cameras to perform advanced image computation and provides unparalleled image quality and next-level image stabilization, new image silicon processors, image sensors and lenses, as well as the core algorithms that enable the systems to operate and provide optimal performance and features. Our hardware engineering team also integrates these innovations and firmware into our product designs and develops our cameras, mounts and accessories. 
Our software engineering team develops applications that enhance the functionality of our products and facilitate the management, editing, sharing and viewing of content. These applications are being developed for mobile, desktop and web-based platforms. Our core technologies include rendering engines to enable smooth video playback and editing, algorithms for moment identification, automatic story creation as well as cloud-based media storage, analysis and playback. Our software engineering team also manages our cloud and web platforms that power our application experiences and direct-to-consumer business via GoPro.com.
Manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment
Our products are designed and developed in the United States, France, China and Romania, and a majority of our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China and Mexico. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. Our strategic commodities team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our cameras, including digital signal processors, sensors and lenses, and we leverage their expertise to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components and leverage our contract manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts.
We have third-party facilities in China for final pack-out of our finished products. These finished products are shipped to fulfillment centers in California, Kentucky, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore that deliver our products to our customers.
Sales channels and customers 
We offer our products in retail outlets as well as in over 100 countries through our direct sales channel, including GoPro.com, and indirectly through our distribution channel. In 2020 and 2019, revenue from GoPro.com represented 32% and 12% of our revenue, respectively, and retail accounted for 68% and 88% of our revenue, respectively.
Direct sales
We sell directly to most of our retailers in the United States, some of our retailers in Europe and to consumers worldwide through GoPro.com. 
Independent specialty retailers. We use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers in the United States focused on sports and consumer activity capture markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about GoPro products and services. We also have an internal, regionally focused sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the independent specialty retailers and manufacturer representatives. Independent specialty retailers generally carry our higher end products, targeting their core customers who we believe tend to be early adopters of new technologies. Independent specialty retailers outside of the United States represent a similarly important sales channel for us, and we reach these customers indirectly through our network of international distributors.
Big box retailers. We sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Inc., Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. We support these retailers with a dedicated and experienced sales management team that we believe enables us to reduce channel conflict.
Mid-market retailers.  We also sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing, and motorsports. In the United States, we sell directly to these mid-market retailers through our experienced sales teams assigned to particular accounts and regions. 
GoPro.com.  We sell our full line of products to consumers worldwide through our online store at GoPro.com, which we market through online and offline advertising. Sales through GoPro.com were 32% and 12% of our revenue for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and less than 10% of our total revenue for 2018. 
Distribution
We sell to over 35 distributors who resell our products to retailers in international and domestic markets. We have 
dedicated sales personnel focused on providing a high level of service to these distributors, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, development of marketing materials, order assistance and educating the distributors’ sales personnel about GoPro products. 
In-store merchandising 
Our in-store merchandising strategy focuses on our iconic GoPro-branded, video-enabled point of purchase (POP) merchandising displays that are located in nearly all retail outlets where our products are sold. These displays showcase GoPro videos and present our product ecosystem in a customer-friendly manner. Our larger retailers help us represent a broader range of GoPro products due to their in-store deployment of our larger and custom POP displays. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately 22,000 and 29,000 POP displays, respectively, in retail outlets worldwide.
Marketing and advertising 
Our marketing and advertising programs are focused on engaging consumers by exposing them to compelling GoPro content and educating them about new hardware features as well as the power of our solutions for software editing (mobile and desktop applications) and content management (GoPro). We believe this approach enhances our brand while demonstrating the performance, durability and versatility of our products. Our marketing and advertising efforts span a wide range of consumer interests and leverage both traditional consumer marketing and lifestyle marketing strategies. 
Consumer marketing.  Social media plays an important role in our consumer marketing strategy. Our consumers capture and share personal GoPro content on social media and content sharing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Vimeo and YouTube. At the end of 2020, we reached a total of 45.9 million lifetime followers. To date, we have reached over 6.6 billion views of content tagged #GoPro on TikTok and more than 3.2 billion views on GoPro’s YouTube channel. We also integrate user-generated content and GoPro originally produced content into advertising campaigns across various platforms including print, online, billboards and other out of home advertising, and at consumer and trade facing events. This content also supports our in-store channel marketing efforts, appearing on our POP displays and other in-store marketing materials. We continue to believe GoPro content remains a significant asset that builds awareness for our brand and products. 
Lifestyle marketing. Our lifestyle marketing programs focus on expanding GoPro brand awareness by engaging consumers through relationships with key influencers, event promotions and other outreach efforts. We cultivate strong relationships with influential athletes, celebrities, entertainers and brands, all of whom use our products to create and share engaging content with their own fans and consumers.
Competition
The market for cameras is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include quality, reliability and user experience, price and performance, design innovation, brand recognition, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and brand reputation.
We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc. and Nikon Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as, Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd., the Ricoh Company, Ltd., Shenzhen Arashi Vision Co., Ltd. and SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. We believe we compete favorably with these companies’ products. Our durable and versatile product design facilitates increased functionality and wearability, and we offer a variety of mounts and other accessories that enable a wide range of consumer use cases that are difficult for other competing products to address. Further, we offer many professional-grade features within our camera and 360-degree camera product offerings at attractive consumer price points, including our HyperSmooth 3.0 which is our most advanced stabilization ever and includes in-camera horizon leveling that keeps shots smooth and level, and for our 360 experience, MAX SuperView and PowerPano. MAX SuperView provides the widest view ever from a GoPro camera while PowerPano allows users to capture a 6.2mp, 270-degree panoramic photo with the push of one button and creates an artifact-free shot of action or movement. We also provide users with a suite of free mobile and desktop applications that enhance the overall GoPro experience. Moreover, we believe we have achieved significant brand recognition in our target vertical markets. We believe our years of experience working with active 
and influential consumers contributes to our ability to develop attractive products and establishes the authenticity of our brand, thereby differentiating us from current and potential competitors. 
Smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those devices. Our GoPro app, GoPro subscription service and GoPro Player desktop editing application may not be as compelling a solution as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Inc. and Google, although the GoPro app supports content from other platforms including content from iOS and Android. Also, it is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of such devices, such as Apple, Google and Samsung, may continue to design their products for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments and waterproof capabilities, or develop products with features similar to ours. In addition, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. Our trademarks, including “GOPRO,” “HERO” and the GoPro logos, among others, are a critical component of the value of our business. In addition, we hold many issued and pending utility and design patents for innovations that help our consumers capture, create and share their content using our cameras, mounts, accessories and software. Our patents cover areas that include physical structures, image processing, operational firmware and software, post-processing software, distribution software, mount and accessory structures, as well as the ornamental aspects of our hardware and software products. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 885 issued patents and 393 patent applications pending in the United States, and 443 corresponding issued patents and 131 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our issued United States patents will expire approximately between 2024 and 2039 and our issued foreign patents will expire approximately between 2022 and 2045. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. We continually review our development efforts to assess our innovations, including their patentability. We take active measures to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party use, including misuse of our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights.
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections in agreements with employees, contract manufacturers, distributors and others. Despite these protections, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing products that are similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States.
Human capital
We are continually investing in the engagement and retention of our global workforce by creating an inclusive workplace, providing market-competitive benefits to support our employees’ health and well-being, and fostering a learning environment in support of their growth and development. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 758 people.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are a company built on the foundation of a simple belief—“Be a HERO”—which means always bringing one’s best to any challenge or opportunity. This tenet is central to how we approach our work on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. We rolled out global training on interpersonal and systems bias to help employees do the internal work of understanding, recognizing, responding and preventing bias at all levels of our organization. Our CEO, Nicholas Woodman, also signed on to the Outdoor CEO Diversity Pledge, committing the Company to, over the coming years, increasing representation of underrepresented groups in our hiring, marketing and athlete rosters, as well as sharing our learnings with other outdoor brands as a catalyst for industry change.
Employee Development and Training
We prioritize employee development and training, which we believe have a direct impact on employee growth, engagement, and retention. To support managers and individual contributors within the company, we provide training and development opportunities focused on remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic through our online portal, Opportunity Lab. Opportunity Lab enables employees to access virtual instructor-led classrooms or self-directed web-based courses focused on topics such as the importance of using emotional intelligence in difficult times, leading change, understanding employee engagement, feedback, and career development planning. Our leadership development focuses on building trust and relationship with peers and sharing best practices by working in small cohorts in each session. We continue to optimize our organizational efficiency and collaboration by providing training on effective meeting management and how to recognize unconscious bias. We believe that employee development is a shared responsibility of employee and manager, and through both formal and informal methods (e.g., stretch assignments and peer-to-peer learning) we build trust and encourage knowledge sharing. Through our Career Conversations program, managers and employees reflect quarterly, guided by our company competency framework, on where they stand and where they need to put in more effort or increase their skills. We have a robust talent calibration and succession planning process to ensure we fill the talent pipeline and identify any skills gaps with development plans.
