 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, is a bank holding company that is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee and that operates primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, CapStar Bank, a Tennessee-chartered state bank. CapStar Bank was incorporated in the State of Tennessee in 2007 and acquired a state charter in 2008 which was accomplished through a de novo application with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Upon approval of its charter, CapStar Bank opened for business to the public on July 14, 2008. CapStar Financial Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in 2015 and, on February 5, 2016, completed a share exchange with CapStar Bank’s shareholders that resulted in CapStar Bank becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 We are a bank that seeks to establish and maintain comprehensive relationships with our clients by delivering customized and creative banking solutions and superior client service. Our products and services include (i) commercial and industrial loans to small and medium sized businesses, (ii) commercial real estate loans, (iii) Mortgage banking products and services, (iv) private banking and wealth management services for the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals; (v) correspondent banking services to meet the needs of Tennessee’s smaller community banks and (vi) various retail and consumer products. Our operations are presently concentrated in Tennessee.
 As of December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $3.1 billion, total deposits of $2.7 billion, total net loans of $1.9 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $380.1 million.
 Core Operating Principles
 We operate our business in conformity with our core principles which are, in order of priority:
 •Soundness - We strive to engage in safe and sound banking practices that preserve the asset quality of our balance sheet and protect our deposit base and ensure we maintain capital levels that are considered above “well capitalized” according to regulatory standards.
 •Profitability - We seek to achieve strong profitability metrics through optimal balance sheet management, prudent expense management, and disciplined capital allocation.
 •Strategic Growth - We seek to grow revenue and net income by building long-term relationships with our customers based on top quality service.
 We have historically adhered to these core operating principles, and we intend to continue to emphasize the importance of these principles to the conduct of our business.


Acquisitions and Expansion
 On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Athens Bancshares Corporation (“Athens”), the bank holding company for Athens Federal Community Bank, National Association (“Athens Federal”), headquartered in Athens, Tennessee. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Athens for approximately $92.9 million in total consideration which was primarily comprised of the issuance of approximately 5.2 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of the acquisition, Athens Federal had eight banking locations located throughout the Eastern Tennessee corridor between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. The operations of Athens are included in our financial statements beginning October 1, 2018.
 On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of FCB Corporation (“FCB”), the bank holding company for the First National Bank of Manchester. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of FCB for approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, Manchester had four banking locations throughout middle Tennessee. The operations of Manchester are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020.
On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of the Bank of Waynesboro (“BOW”). We acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of BOW for approximately 0.7 million shares of common stock of our Company. At the time of acquisition, BOW had six banking locations throughout Southern Tennessee. The operations of BOW are included in our financial statements beginning July 1, 2020.
In addition to acquisitions, we seek opportunities to expand our presence organically when we identify a strong banking team in a market with attractive economic characteristics and market demographics where we believe we can achieve accelerated growth of loans and deposits while deploying capital in a disciplined manner. Prior to entering a new market, historically we have identified and built a team of experienced, successful bankers with market-specific knowledge to lead the bank’s operations in that market. Generally, we or members of our senior management team are familiar with these individuals based on prior work experience and reputation, and strongly believe in the ability of such individuals to successfully execute our business model. Ideal geographic areas for expansion include those with successful, experienced bankers with strong reputations in the market and economic attributes necessary to drive quality lending and deposit opportunities. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company announced the hiring of a team of nine experienced financial professionals to grow market share and serve clients in Chattanooga, TN.
Our Products and Services
 Loans
General. Through our bank, we offer a broad range of commercial lending products to small and medium sized businesses, the owners and operators of our business clients and other high net worth individuals. Our strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of the type of loan product, the type of client and the industries in which our business clients are engaged.
Our commercial and industrial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and medium sized businesses. We offer commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied properties, as well as interim construction loans.
 Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans which are typically thereafter sold on the secondary market. We offer second mortgage home equity mortgage loans and other consumer related loans such as loans for automobile or other recreational vehicles, which we maintain on the Bank’s balance sheet. Additionally, we offer lines of credit to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request.
 We market our lending products and services to existing clients through our client service. We seek to attract new lending clients through banking teams that are specifically dedicated to the markets in which we serve. We believe our industry-specific knowledge, product and local market expertise and engagement increase our profile within these lending verticals, enable us to identify, select and compete for qualified borrowers and attractive financing projects and manage more effectively the potential risks of our loan portfolio.
 Underwriting. Disciplined underwriting is the foundation of our credit culture. We strive to adhere to thorough underwriting standards and deliver customized and creative loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner.


Philosophically, we seek loans that are prudent and desirable, not just “doable.” In considering a loan, we follow the underwriting principles in our loan and credit administration policies which include the following requirements:
 •receipt of certain financial information, such as financial statements, tax returns and credit reports, to ensure that the potential borrower has sufficient recurring cash flow and liquidity to repay the loan;
 •determination that the structure of the loan matches the underlying purpose of and repayment source for the loan, the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and the depreciable life of any collateral;
 •verification that the potential borrower has a demonstrated propensity to repay the loan/the borrower’s indebtedness/etc.;
 •consideration of the value, liquidity and marketability of the potential borrower’s assets and identifying and evaluating all significant direct and contingent liabilities; and
 •determination and approval of the rates and fees associated with the potential loan.
 Except in very limited circumstances in which substantial equity is present, our commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are supported by personal guaranties from the principals of the borrower. In addition, we require our non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans to be secured by well- managed income producing property with adequate margins, supported by a history of profitable operations and cash flows, and proven operating stability.
 Our underwriting processes collaboratively engage our bankers and credit underwriters in the analysis of each loan request. We manage our credit risks by analyzing metrics in order to maintain a conservative and well-diversified loan portfolio reflective of our assessment of various subsets within our market. Based upon our aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we employ tiered review of loan originations that may involve joint line and credit authorization, our bank’s Credit Committee or, ultimately, our full board of directors.
 Concentrations. We are a relationship-oriented, rather than a transaction-based, bank. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans have been made to borrowers located in our Target Market. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 73% of the loans in our loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were made to borrowers who live or conduct business in our Target Market, and a substantial portion of those loans are considered commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied and non-owner occupied real estate), mortgage loans and construction loans. As such, a substantial majority of our loan portfolio is dependent upon the economic environment of our Target Market. We do have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of Tennessee, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us because they are headquartered or reside within Tennessee.
 In addition, we employ appropriate limits on our overall loan portfolio and requirements with respect to certain types of lending. As a general practice, we operate with an internal guideline limiting loans to any single borrowing relationship to a tiered amount based upon our internal risk rating. Many of our loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2021, our 25 largest borrowing relationships (which may include multiple loans to one borrower or loans to multiple entities that are affiliated due to common ownership) accounted for approximately 15% of our total loan portfolio.
 Credit Risk Management. Managing credit risk is a process that involves the entire Company. Our strategy for credit risk management includes the disciplined underwriting process described above, adherence to prudent standards, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all loan exposures. Our Chief Credit Policy Officer provides bank-wide credit oversight and regularly reviews the loan portfolio to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. We periodically submit ourselves to review by independent third parties to validate our internal oversight. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of these situations before the loans become delinquent or impaired, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
 Credit risk management involves a partnership between our bankers and our credit department with credit approval processes requiring concurrence of the two. The members of our credit administration group primarily focus their efforts on credit analysis, underwriting and monitoring of credits and providing management reporting to executive management and our board of directors. Based upon size, emerging problem loans are assigned to our special assets process to mitigate the risk of loss. Executive management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified

assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio. Our collections department is also responsible for managing the collection and foreclosure process and the disposal of other real estate owned.
 Deposits
 Core deposits are our principal source of funds for use in lending and other general banking purposes. We solicit core deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through relationship-focused marketing. We provide a full range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS® reciprocal products. We do not rely on brokered deposits as a meaningful source of funding.
Our ability to gather deposits is an important aspect of our business franchise, and we believe this is a significant driver of our success. Our largest sources of deposits are NOW, Demand Deposit Accounts, money market and savings accounts. Our transaction accounts include checking and NOW accounts, which provide us with a source of fee income, as well as a low-cost source of funds. Time accounts also provide us with a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. Certificates of deposit are held primarily by clients in our Target Market.
 Deposit rates are reviewed regularly by pricing committee as we continuously seek to price our deposit products and services to promote core deposit growth. Our management believes that the rates that we offer are competitive with those offered by other institutions in our Target Market.
 Correspondent Banking
We provide correspondent banking services to community banks. Services we offer include settlement, Fed Funds lines of credit, depository products, wire transfer services, bank holding company loans and loan participations on larger commercial and commercial real estate exposures. Correspondent banking deposits comprised approximately $408.5 million or 15% of our total deposits as of December 31, 2021.
Correspondent banking provides a valuable funding source for the bank. In 2013, management identified a void in the Tennessee correspondent banking market due to the instability of larger correspondent banks. Other factors leading to the expansion of correspondent banking included a need to diversify our funding base, the desire by many community banks to do business with a Tennessee-based correspondent bank, the ability to recruit well-known and respected talent for business development and risk management, and the ability to license a low cost proprietary settlement platform.
Mortgage Banking
 Mortgage banking generated $0.9 billion in mortgage loan originations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Mortgage loans are typically sold in the secondary market and are underwritten by the bank. Mortgage banking has provided the bank a source of noninterest income and referrals for other banking services including home equity lines of credit and deposit products.
Other Services
 Given client demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour telephone and online banking, direct deposit, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, remote deposit and cash management services for individuals and small and medium sized business. We also participate in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers are able to use throughout Tennessee and other regions. In many cases, we reimburse our customer for any ATM fees that may be charged to the customer.
Competition
 The financial services industry is highly competitive in our Target Market. In particular, the Target Market consisted of 84 financial institutions with over $114 billion in deposits as of June 30, 2021. We held the number 9 deposit market share position at June 30, 2021 with 2.5% of the deposit market share. We compete for loans, deposits, and financial services in our Target Market. We compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, Internet-based banks, out-of-market banks, and bank holding companies that advertise in or otherwise serve our market area, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loans and deposits, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer

additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. Some of our competitors have been in business for a long time and have an established client base and name recognition. Changes in regulation, technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment. We expect to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products; however, we believe that our experienced leadership, efficient and scalable operating model, personalized service and emphasis on attracting core deposits from our other product offerings enable us to effectively compete in the communities in which we operate.
 Information and Technology
 We continually adapt to the changing technological needs and wants of our clients by investing in our electronic banking platform. We use a combination of online and mobile banking channels to attract and retain clients and expand the convenience of banking with us. In most cases, our clients can initiate banking transactions from the convenience of their personal computer or smart phone, reducing the number of in-branch visits necessary to conduct routine banking transactions. The remote transactions available to our clients include remote image deposit, bill payment, external and internal transfers, ACH origination and wire transfer. We believe that our investments in technology and innovation are consistent with our clients’ needs and will support future migration of our clients’ transactions to these and other developing electronic banking channels. Further, we closely monitor information security for trends and new threats, including cybersecurity risks, and invest significant resources to continuously improve the security and privacy of our systems and data. For more information, please see “– Supervision and Regulation - Cybersecurity and Privacy”. The Company also has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 397 total employees. As a service-oriented business, our long-term success depends on our people and we are committed to taking a multi-dimensional approach to talent and culture. Our people and culture are critical to the Company’s long-term success.
As such, our talent vision and strategy focus on:
 Talent Vision, Strategy and Development
 •Enabling talent and performance management that generates career opportunities and creates future leaders of the organization. 
 •Empathy towards others that gives us a unique understanding and ability to provide internal and external service excellence.
 •Supporting a healthy work-life balance by offering generous paid time off for vacation (four weeks per year), holidays (including birthday), and sick leave. 
 •Delivering a competitive compensation package, including medical, dental and vision benefits; paid life, disability, and long-term care insurance; and 401(k) employer contribution.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion- At CapStar, we cultivate and advance diversity in all forms as part of building a strong culture, a culture in which inclusion and belonging are paramount, and where all of our colleagues strive to be open and inclusive leaders and teammates. Our culture is what unifies our colleagues across our diverse business model, ensures we are best positioned to serve our diverse clients and propels our continuous evolution. We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer and enforce those values throughout all of our operations. We prohibit discrimination in hiring or advancement against any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sex, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetics, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
 Oversight- Transparency and accountability are critical to driving our recruiting and development practices. We are committed to advancing the leadership of our Board through the inclusion of female and diverse directors, as detailed in the Company’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. With more than 20% female representation, the Company was recognized nationally for its commitment to board diversity by the 2020 Women on Boards education and awareness campaign as one of only 52% of Russell 3000 companies earning the distinction.

We employ Gallup Engagement Surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and solicit feedback from team members on ways management can improve the working environment and development of team members. Management has specific goals developed through these surveys and is encouraged to constantly improve the work environment and team member satisfaction and retention.
 None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement.
Environmental Matters
 The Company knows that we are responsible for protecting our planet and understands that reducing our business’s carbon footprint is key to a sustainable future. We are committed to measuring and minimizing our collective impact on the environment while contributing to environmental stewardship and responsible business operations. We have embedded environmental sustainability throughout our products, services, operations, and culture to drive efficiencies and responsible resource use while creating comfortable, safe, and healthy workplaces for our stakeholders. We do this by focusing on LED conversions and timely replacement of HVAC systems in our existing buildings and the installation of the most energy efficient alternatives in connection with new construction. Further, we mandate the recycling of shred waste as well as striving to optimize building occupancy to limit the adverse impact of unnecessary expansion. Additionally, we drive reductions in our carbon footprint through the utilization of technology and digital channels, including payments, credit, savings, remittances, online and mobile banking, and imaging systems. We also promote the use of electronic deposit account statements, loan, tax and other notices, and eSign technology, which support efficiency and paper reduction.
We impact the environment through our operations and through the financing of the operations of other companies that could pose risks to the environment. CapStar works hard to ensure that our lending activities do not encourage business activities that could cause irreparable damage to our reputation or the environment. As a result, we try to conduct business responsibly and actively work with stakeholders to best serve our various constituents. In general, we evaluate each credit or transaction on its individual merits, with larger deals receiving more attention and deeper analysis. Our underwriting process regularly looks at governance issues and seeks to incorporate relevant industry risks.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance and that of our subsidiaries may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDFI, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitizations and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results and those of our bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.
Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that are intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and enter into acquisitions with other companies, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends.
This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective primary federal regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance

with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.
The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and our bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Since we own all of the capital stock of our bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve.
Acquisition of Banks
The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve’s prior approval before:
•acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control 5% or more of the bank’s voting shares; 
 •acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 
 •merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 
 Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section titled “Item 1. Business—Regulation and Supervision—Capital Adequacy.” The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering program of the acquiring bank holding company and the anti-money laundering compliance records of a bank to be acquired as part of the transaction. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system.
Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Tennessee may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, state law may place restrictions on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Tennessee law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Tennessee-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least three years.
Change in Bank Control
Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring “control” of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of “control” of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act. In addition, any person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring 25% (or 5% in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to

control in any manner the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over the bank holding company.
Permitted Activities
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:
 •banking or managing or controlling banks; and 
 •any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 
 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include:
 •factoring accounts receivable; 
 •making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; 
 •leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; 
 •operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; 
 •engaging in trust company functions in a manner authorized by state law; 
 •financial and investment advisory activities; 
 •discount securities brokerage activities; 
 •underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; 
 •providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; 
 •performing selected data processing services and support services; 
 •acting as an agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and 
 •performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 
 The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
Support of Subsidiary Institutions
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. As a result of a bank holding company’s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank.
Repurchase or Redemption of Securities
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions.

Bank Regulation and Supervision
Our bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of our bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of our bank and our bank’s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to our bank.
Since our bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Tennessee and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI. The Federal Reserve and the TDFI regularly examine our bank’s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Our bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. Our bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations.
Branching
Under current Tennessee law, our bank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of, or prior notice to, the TDFI and the Federal Reserve. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, our bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Tennessee. Under federal law, our bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. While prior law imposed various limits on the ability of banks to establish new branches in states other than their home state, the Dodd-Frank Act allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch. This makes it much simpler for banks to open de novo branches in other states.
FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments
The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the assessment rate is determined by the risk category assigned to an institution based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations which are designed to measure risk, with riskier institutions paying a higher assessment rate. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions were required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The final FICO assessment collection occurred in March 2019.
 Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our bank’s record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank’s CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. As of December 31, 2021 the Bank had a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”
 Interest Rate Limitations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by our bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.

Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions
Our bank’s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including:
•the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 •the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; 
 •the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; 
 •the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
 •the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by debt collectors; 
 •the Service Members Civil Relief Act, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; 
 •the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, governing the disclosure and safeguarding of sensitive non-public personal information of our clients; 
 •the Right to Financial Privacy Act, imposing a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 •the Electronic Funds Transfer Act governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and clients’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 
 •the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 
 Capital Adequacy
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, under the adopted regulations, the Basel member central bank and federal bank regulators approved the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord, or Basel III. The U.S. Basel III rule’s minimum capital to risk-weighted assets, or RWA, requirements are as follows: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0%. The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0%. The rule also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the U.S. Basel III rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital.
Under the U.S. Basel III rule, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to RWA. Phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirements began on January 1, 2016, and the requirements became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization maintaining capital levels in excess of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework requires us to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7% for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5% total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. With the capital conservation buffer fully phased in, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action, or PCA, well-capitalized thresholds.

Generally, banking organizations of our size became subject to the U.S. Basel III rule on January 1, 2015, while the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital phased in over time. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) into which all insured depository institutions are placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of those categories. For an insured depository institution to be “well capitalized” under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2021, our bank qualified for the “well capitalized” category.
Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.
An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new markets or product offerings, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval.
The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.
Liquidity
Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. This scrutiny has increased during recent years, as the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s negatively affected the liquidity of many financial institutions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management) and FDIC Financial Institution Letter FIL-84-2008 (Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions.
Any increased liquidity requirements applied to us or our bank generally would be expected to cause us or our bank to invest assets more conservatively—and therefore at lower yields—than we and our bank otherwise might invest. Such lower-yield investments likely would reduce our revenue stream, and in turn our earnings potential.
Payment of Dividends
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is dividends our bank pays to us as our bank’s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to our bank’s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. The requirement that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks also results in the position of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Tennessee corporate law which prevents payment of dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and our bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs.
The TDFI also regulates our bank’s dividend payments. Under Tennessee law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend without prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI if the total of all dividends declared by its board of directors in any calendar year will exceed (i) the total of its retained net income for that year, plus (ii) its retained net income for the preceding two years.
Our bank’s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Our bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of the bank’s transactions with its affiliates.
 Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the bank’s transactions with affiliates is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, transactions with affiliates also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Our bank must also comply with provisions prohibiting the acquisition of low-quality assets from an affiliate.
Our bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
Our bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
Single Borrower Credit Limits
Under Tennessee law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 15% of our bank’s capital, surplus and undivided profits. However, such loans may be in excess of that percentage, but not above 25%, if each loan in excess of 15% is first submitted to and approved in advance in writing by the board of directors and a record is kept of such written approval and reported to the board of directors quarterly.
Commercial Real Estate Concentration
In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices” to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate, or CRE, loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance entitled “Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending.” Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100% or more of the institution’s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300% or more of the institution’s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. As of December 31, 2021, our bank’s total CRE loans represented 217% of total capital.
Privacy
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting non-public personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers.
Consumer Credit Reporting
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) imposes, among other things:
 •requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer’s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; 
 •requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; 
 •requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and 
 •limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes. 
 Anti-Terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation
Our bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. Our bank has established an anti-money laundering program pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act and customer identification program pursuant to the USA Patriot Act. The bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. Our bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements.
Overdraft Fees
Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks’ abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions.
The Dodd-Frank Act
As final rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, this new law has significantly changed and is significantly changing the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on the rules and regulations that implement it.
A number of the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this “Supervision and Regulation” section. The following items provide a brief description of certain other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and our bank.
•The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority with respect to enumerated consumer financial protection laws over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer financial protection laws by their primary federal regulator. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of new consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower’s “ability to repay” a residential mortgage loan. Final rules implementing these latter statutory requirements became effective in 2014. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits effective one year after the date of its enactment, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense. 
 •The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. 
 As noted above, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us. However, we expect compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 The Volcker Rule
On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally prohibits any “banking entity” from engaging in proprietary trading or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with covered funds (i.e., hedge funds or private equity funds). In addition, the Volcker Rule requires each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule.

On October 8, 2019, the agencies finalized revisions to the Volcker Rule that, among other things, simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for banking entities that do not have significant trading activities, while banking entities with significant trading activity would become subject to more stringent compliance requirements. Further, the revisions to the Volcker Rule implemented Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which amended the definition of “banking entity” to exclude certain community banks from the definition of insured depository institution, the general result of which was to exclude such banks and their affiliates and subsidiaries from the scope of the Volcker Rule. Under EGRRCPA, a community bank and its affiliates are generally excluded from the definition of “banking entity” if the bank and all companies that control the bank have total consolidated assets equal to $10 billion or less and trading assets and liabilities equal to five percent or less of total consolidated assets. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with a required compliance date of January 1, 2021.
 Limitations on Incentive Compensation
In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company and our bank, the proposal imposes principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions are prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal also imposes certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size. The Federal Reserve reserves the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of the Company’s and our bank’s size.
Cybersecurity and Privacy
 Cybersecurity is a high-priority item for legislators and regulators at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally. State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements and, in some cases, regulations, emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision. Such policy statements and regulations indicate that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. A financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. These requirements, including state regulatory rules such as the detailed and extensive cybersecurity rules issued in 2016 by the New York State Department of Financial Services, may cause us to incur significant additional compliance costs and in some cases may impact our growth prospects. Additionally, if we fail to observe federal or state regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
The Company has an Information Technology (IT) Steering Committee comprised of internal managers representing various divisions of the Company. The Committee oversees IT strategic and investment priorities and the Company’s Information Security Program. The Committee regularly reports to the Risk Committee of the Board through distribution of meeting minutes and other presentations and communication, including a comprehensive overview of the Company’s cyber and information security program annually.
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We also employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, as attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and complexity, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Financial expenditures may also be required to meet regulatory changes in the information security and cybersecurity domains. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks

are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See “Item 1A. – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.
Federal statutes and regulations, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) and the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, limit our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers, customers and employees to nonaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the GLBA requires us to disclose our privacy policies and practices relating to sharing non-public information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. The GLBA also requires us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information and, if applicable state law is more protective of customer privacy than the GLBA, financial institutions, including our bank, will be required to comply with such state law. Other laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information.
Proposed or new legislation and regulations may also significantly increase our compliance cost and impede our ability to grow into specific markets. There are a number of proposals that have either recently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. In addition, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. Both the GDPR and the CCPA impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. In the event of a data breach, there are mandatory reporting requirements that may hamper the ability to fully assess an incident prior to external reporting. We must maintain awareness of additional legal and regulatory requirements that apply to existing and future subsets of the customer base for protection against legal, reputational, and financial risk due to compliance failures.
