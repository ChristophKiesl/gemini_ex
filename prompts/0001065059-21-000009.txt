Item 1. Business
Overview
Centrus Energy Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Centrus” or the “Company”), is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry, which provides a reliable source of carbon free energy. References to “Centrus”, the “Company”, “our”, or “we” include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to Centrus, unless the context otherwise indicates. We were incorporated in 1998 as part of the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation.
Centrus operates two business segments: (a) low-enriched uranium (“LEU”), which supplies various components of nuclear fuel to utilities from our global network of suppliers, and (b) technical solutions, which provides advanced engineering, design, and manufacturing services to government and private sector customers, and is deploying advanced nuclear fuel production capabilities to power existing and next-generation reactors around the world. 
Our LEU segment provides most of the Company’s revenue, and involves the sale of nuclear fuel to utilities operating commercial nuclear power plants. The majority of these sales are for the enrichment component of LEU, which is measured in separative work units (“SWU”). Centrus also sells natural uranium (the raw material needed to produce LEU) and occasionally sells LEU with the natural uranium, uranium conversion, and SWU components combined into one sale. 
LEU is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity. We supply LEU and its components to both domestic and international utilities for use in nuclear reactors worldwide. We provide LEU from multiple sources, including our inventory, medium- and long- term supply contracts, and spot purchases. As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our objective is to provide value through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources. 
Our global order book includes long-term sales contracts with major utilities through 2030. We have secured cost-competitive supplies of SWU under long-term contracts through the end of this decade to allow us to fill our existing customer orders and make new sales. A market-related price reset provision in our largest supply contract took effect at the beginning of 2019 – when market prices for SWU were near historic lows – which has significantly lowered our cost of sales and contributed to improved margins. Spot price indicators for SWU have risen by approximately 56% since bottoming out in August 2018. Refer to LEU Segment Order Book and Suppliers below. 
In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) reached agreement with the Russian Federation on an extension of the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement (“RSA”), a trade agreement that allows for Russian-origin nuclear fuel to be imported into the United States in limited quantities. The two parties agreed to extend the agreement through 2040 and to set aside a significant portion of the import quotas through 2028 to execute Centrus’ long-term supply agreement (the “TENEX Supply Contract”) with the Russian government entity TENEX, Joint -Stock Company (“TENEX”). This outcome allows for sufficient quota for Centrus to continue serving its U.S. utility customers.
Our technical solutions segment is deploying advanced nuclear fuel production capabilities to meet the evolving needs of the global nuclear industry and the U.S. government, while also levering our unique technical expertise, operational experience, and specialized facilities to expand and diversify our business beyond uranium enrichment, offering new services to existing and new customers in complementary markets.
Our technical solutions segment has as its goal the restoration of America’s domestic uranium enrichment capability to play a critical role in meeting U.S. national security and energy security requirements, advancing America’s nonproliferation objectives, and delivering the next-generation nuclear fuels that will power the future of nuclear energy providing reliable carbon free power around the world. The U.S. has not had a domestic uranium enrichment capability suitable to meet U.S. national security requirements since the aging Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Paducah GDP”) shut down in 2013. Centrus is the only American company working to deploy an enrichment technology and our AC100M centrifuge is the only deployment-ready uranium enrichment technology that can meet these requirements.
Centrus is uniquely positioned to lead the transition to a new nuclear fuel known as High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (“HALEU”), which is expected to be required by the commercial and/or government sectors for a number of advanced reactor and fuel designs currently under development. While existing reactors typically operate on LEU with the uranium-235 isotope concentration below 5%, HALEU has a uranium-235 concentration ranging from 5% to 20%, giving it several potential technical and economic advantages. For example, the higher concentration of uranium-235 means that fuel assemblies and reactors can be smaller and reactors will require less frequent refueling. Reactors can also achieve higher “burnup” rates, meaning that a smaller volume of fuel will be required overall and less waste will be produced. HALEU may also be used in the future to fabricate next-generation fuel forms for the existing fleet of reactors in the U.S. and around the world. These new HALEU-based fuels could improve the economics of nuclear reactors and inherent safety features while increasing the amount of electricity that can be generated at existing reactors. HALEU fuel may also ultimately be used in new commercial and government applications in the future, such as reactors for the military.
In 2019, Centrus began work on a three-year, $115 million cost-share contract (the “HALEU Contract”) with the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) to deploy a cascade of 16 of our AC100M centrifuges to demonstrate production of HALEU with domestic technology. As part of this effort, Centrus expects its Piketon, Ohio facility to become the first plant in the nation licensed to produce HALEU, with enrichment levels up to a U-235 concentration just below 20%. At the conclusion of the demonstration program funding in 2022, our goal is to continue production and scale up the facility in modular fashion as demand for HALEU grows in the commercial and/or government sectors. Refer to “Technical Solutions - Government Contracting” below for additional details.
Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we have continued to make progress under the contract. On June 23, 2020, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) accepted for review our application to amend our license to permit the production of HALEU up to 20% U235 enrichment. We believe our investment in the HALEU technology will position the Company to meet the needs of our customers in the future as they deploy advanced reactors and next generation fuels. Advanced nuclear reactors promise to provide an important source of reliable carbon free power. By investing in HALEU technology now, and as the only domestically-owned company with HALEU enrichment capability, we believe the Company could be well positioned to capitalize on a potential new market as the demand for HALEU-based fuels increases with the development of advanced reactors. There are no guarantees about whether or when government or commercial demand for HALEU will materialize, and there are a number of technical, regulatory and economic hurdles that must be overcome for these fuels and reactors to come to the market. Since the HALEU demonstration program will conclude in early 2022, we are focused on developing options to sustain and expand our demonstrated capability for the period immediately following the conclusion of the program.
In late 2020, DOE announced ten awards under its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (“ARDP”) aimed at helping innovative, next generation reactor designs overcome technical and financial obstacles to successfully commercialize. This includes a commitment to support construction to two demonstration reactors over the next seven years and awards to support continued development of eight other reactor designs. Nine of the ten reactor designs chosen are expected to require HALEU fuel.
Centrus has built formal and informal relationships with most of the ARDP awardees and expects to be first to market with domestically-produced HALEU that could be used to fuel these reactors. For example, on September 15, 2020, Centrus made a joint announcement with TerraPower LLC (“TerraPower”) that the two companies plan to work together toward establishing commercial-scale domestic HALEU production capabilities. Centrus also has worked under a series of contracts with X Energy, LLC (“X-energy”), a pioneering advanced reactor and advanced nuclear fuel company, to support X-energy’s work to develop a facility to fabricate HALEU into an advanced fuel called tristructural isotropic (TRISO) fuel. TerraPower and X-energy were the two companies chosen by DOE for the largest awards under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. While first year funding for the two companies totaled $160 million, DOE announced its intent to ultimately provide a combined total of $3.2 billion over a seven year period to help TerraPower and X-energy build their first reactors. The awards are subject to annual appropriations by Congress and there can be no assurance that the projects will be completed or that TerraPower and X-energy will ultimately purchase HALEU from Centrus.
On October 13, 2020, Centrus announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Terrestrial Energy USA (“TEUSA”) to secure fuel supply for a future fleet of TEUSA’s Integral Molten Salt Reactor (“IMSR”) power plants. The two companies will evaluate the logistical, regulatory, and transportation requirements to establish fuel supply for IMSR power plants, which use LEU. There can be no assurance that the Company and TEUSA will ultimately enter into a contract on terms that will be acceptable.
With the specialized capabilities and workforce at our Technology and Manufacturing Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, we are performing technical, engineering and manufacturing services for a range of commercial and government customers and actively working to secure new customers. Our experience developing, licensing, manufacturing, and operating advanced nuclear components and systems positions us to provide critical design, engineering, manufacturing, and other services to a broad range of potential clients, including those involving sensitive or classified technologies. This work includes design, engineering, manufacturing, and licensing services support for advanced reactor and fuel fabrication projects as well as decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) work. 
The Company continues to look at opportunities to improve its capital structure and to enhance shareholder value. As a result, on September 1, 2020, the Company completed the sale of 2,537,500 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 that became effective on August 5, 2020, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on August 21, 2020. The price to the public in the offering was $10.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $25.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company of $2.3 million. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general working capital purposes, to invest in technology development and to repay outstanding debt or retire shares of its Series B Senior Preferred Stock.
On November 17, 2020, pursuant to a tender offer announced on October 19, 2020, the Company completed the purchase of 62,854 shares of its outstanding Series B Preferred Stock at a price per share of $954.59, less any applicable withholding taxes, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60 million. The purchase price per share represented a 25% discount from the aggregate liquidation preference, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of $1,272.78 per share as of September 30, 2020. These shares represented approximately 60% of the Company's outstanding Series B Preferred Shares as of September 30, 2020. The remaining Series B Preferred shares outstanding after the transaction was 41,720 shares.
On December 31, 2020, the Company entered into an At Market Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Lake Street Capital Markets, LLC, relating to the at the market offering of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, $0.10 par value per share. The shares of Class A Common Stock were issued pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-239242), which became effective on August 5, 2020, and a prospectus supplement dated December 31, 2020 to the prospectus, dated August 5, 2020. For further details, refer to Note 21, Subsequent Events of the consolidated financial statements.
The nuclear industry in general, and the nuclear fuel industry in particular, is in a period of significant change, which continues to affect the competitive landscape. In the years following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, the published market prices for uranium enrichment declined more than 75% through mid-2018. While the monthly price indicators have since increased, the uranium enrichment segment of the nuclear fuel market remains oversupplied (including because foreign-owned enrichers continued to expand even as demand fell) and faces uncertainty about future demand for nuclear power generation. Changes in the competitive landscape affect pricing trends, change customer spending patterns, and create uncertainty. To address these changes, we have taken steps to adjust our cost structure; we may seek further adjustments to our cost structure and operations and evaluate opportunities to grow our business organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
We are also actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential strategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies or changes to our capital structure. In connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner with other parties to consummate a transaction.
We believe that our position as a leading provider of enriched uranium and our long-standing global relationships will enable us to increase our future market share in the nuclear fuel market and support our growth into complementary areas of the nuclear and other industries. We are well-positioned to capitalize on our heritage, industry-wide relationships, and diversity of supply to provide reliable and competitive sources of nuclear fuel and related services. Centrus continues to be valued by its customers as a source of diversity, stability, and competition in the enrichment market.
For further details, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Market Conditions and Outlook. For a discussion of the potential risks and uncertainties facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Low Enriched Uranium
LEU consists of two components: separative work units (“SWU”) and uranium. Revenue from our LEU segment is derived primarily from:
•sales of the SWU component of LEU,
•sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and
•sales of natural uranium.
Revenue from our LEU segment accounted for approximately 77% of our total revenue in 2020. Our customers are primarily domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants. Our agreements with electric utilities are primarily medium and long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU from us. Our agreements for natural uranium and enriched uranium product sales, where we sell both the SWU and uranium component of LEU, are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts. 
Uranium and Enrichment
Uranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, and several other countries including the United States. According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), there are adequate measured resources of natural uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years. In its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (“U235”) and uranium-238 (“U238”). The concentration of U235 in natural uranium is only 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U235 concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Future reactor designs currently under development will likely require higher U235 concentration levels of up to 20%. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration of U235 is increased.

SWU is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two components: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U235 and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U235. The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using an industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its SWU component and the quantity of natural uranium deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or “feed” component. 
While in some cases customers purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from us, utility customers typically provide uranium to us as part of their enrichment contracts, and in exchange we deliver LEU to these customers and charge for the SWU component. Title to uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU, at which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer, and we take title to the uranium.
The following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle:
Mining and Milling. Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated. 
Conversion. Uranium concentrates (“U3O8”) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (“UF6”), a solid at room temperature and a gas when heated. UF6 is shipped to an enrichment plant. 
Enrichment. UF6 is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U235 isotope in the UF6 from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, or LEU, which is usable as a fuel for current light water commercial nuclear power reactors. Future commercial reactor designs may use uranium enriched up to 20% U235, or HALEU.
Fuel Fabrication. LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form fuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants. As the advanced reactor market develops, HALEU may be converted to uranium oxide, metal, chloride or fluoride salts, or other forms and loaded into a variety of fuel assembly types optimized for the specific reactor design.
Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate approximately 20% of U.S. electricity and 10% of the world’s electricity.
Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor’s core. The used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or concrete and steel casks for interim storage.
LEU Segment Order Book
Our order book of sales under contract in the LEU segment (“order book”) extends to 2030. As of December 31, 2020, our order book was approximately $960 million. The order book is the estimated aggregate dollar amount of revenue for future SWU and uranium deliveries, and includes approximately $328 million of deferred revenue and advances from customers as of December 31, 2020, whereby customers have made advance payments to be applied against future deliveries. We estimate that approximately 2% of our order book is at risk related to customer operations. We anticipate our SWU and uranium revenue from sales currently under contract in our order book will be in a range of $130 million to $140 million during 2021. As of December 31, 2019, our order book was approximately $1.0 billion.
Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our order book estimate is based partially on customers’ estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, the customer may be able to increase or decrease the quantity delivered within an agreed range. Our order book estimate is also based on our estimates of selling prices, which may be subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are variable. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our order book.
Suppliers
We have a diverse base of supply that includes:
•existing inventory of LEU,
•mid- and long-term contracts with enrichment producers,
•purchases and loans from secondary sources including fabricators and utility operators of nuclear power plants that have excess inventory, and
•spot purchases of SWU, uranium and LEU.
We have and will seek to continue to further diversify this base of supply and take advantage of opportunities to obtain additional short and long-term supplies of LEU. 

Currently, our largest suppliers of SWU are the Russian government entity TENEX and the French government owned company Orano Cycle (“Orano”). 
Under the TENEX Supply Contract, we purchase SWU contained in LEU received from TENEX, and we deliver natural uranium to TENEX for the LEU’s uranium component. The TENEX Supply Contract originally was signed with commitments through 2022 but was modified in 2015 to give us the right to reschedule certain quantities of SWU of the original commitments into the period 2023 and beyond, in return for the purchase of additional SWU in those years. We have exercised our right to reschedule deliveries through 2028 when the TENEX Supply Contract is scheduled to terminate.

Under the TENEX Supply Contract, we pay for the SWU contained in the LEU delivered to us, and either supply natural uranium to TENEX for the uranium content of the LEU or, in limited cases, pay for such content. SWU pricing is determined by a formula that uses a combination of market-related price points and other factors. The LEU that we obtain from TENEX under the TENEX Supply Contract currently is subject to quotas and other restrictions under an agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation governing exports of Russian uranium products to the United States. This agreement was scheduled to expire as of December 31, 2020. However, it was extended through 2040 under an agreement reached in October 2020 by the DOC and the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation (“ROSATOM”). The extension provides quotas for shipments of Russian uranium products to the United States after 2020, and allocates a substantial portion of the quotas through 2028 for use under Centrus’ TENEX Supply Contract. These quotas will allow us to continue to supply Russian LEU to our U.S. customers through 2028. Shortly after the extension was signed, the terms of the RSA, as extended, were also adopted into law by the U.S. Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.
The amount of SWU we must purchase from TENEX under the TENEX Supply Contract exceeds our current sales order book and, therefore, we will need to make new sales to place all the Russian LEU we must order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX.  In addition, because the quotas do not cover all of the LEU that we must order to fulfill our purchase obligations under the TENEX Supply Contract, we expect that a portion of the Russian LEU that we order during the term of the TENEX Supply Contract will need to be delivered to customers who will 
use it in overseas reactors. The Russian LEU that we deliver to international customers can be delivered either at fabrication facilities in the United States or overseas. 
We also have an agreement with Orano (the “Orano Supply Agreement”) for the long-term supply of SWU contained in LEU, nominally commencing in 2023. Under the Orano Supply Agreement, we will purchase SWU contained in LEU received from Orano, and then deliver natural uranium to Orano for the natural uranium feed material component of LEU. We have the option to extend the six-year purchase period for an additional two years. The Orano Supply Agreement provides significant flexibility to adjust purchase volumes, subject to annual minimums and maximums in fixed amounts that vary year by year. The pricing for the SWU purchased by us is determined by a formula that uses a combination of market-related price points and other factors, and is subject to certain floors and ceilings. Prices are payable in a combination of U.S. dollars and euros.
We procure LEU from other sources under short-term and long-term contracts and have inventories available that diversify our supply portfolio and provide flexibility to meet the needs of our customers. We also have agreements to borrow SWU which we can use to optimize our purchases and deliveries over time.
Market prices for SWU fell substantially in the aftermath of the nuclear incident at Fukushima, Japan in 2011. Recent purchases of SWU and our long-term contract with Orano reflect this decline in market prices. We signed our large, long-term supply agreement with TENEX in 2011. Prices under the TENEX Supply Contract also have been adjusted to reflect lower market prices based on a one-time market related price reset that was agreed when we signed the contract in 2011. The reset occurred in 2018, reducing the unit cost per SWU for purchases we made in 2019-2020 and will make for the duration of the contract.
Technical Solutions
Our technical solutions segment reflects our technical, manufacturing, engineering and operations services offered to public and private sector customers, including the American Centrifuge engineering, procurement, construction, manufacturing and operations services being performed under the HALEU Contract. With our private sector customers, we seek to leverage our domestic enrichment experience, engineering know-how, and precision manufacturing facility to assist customers with a range of engineering, design, and advanced manufacturing projects, including the production of fuel for next-generation nuclear reactors and the development of related facilities. Refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID-19. 
Government Contracting
On October 31, 2019, we signed the cost-share HALEU Contract with DOE to deploy a cascade of centrifuges to demonstrate production of HALEU for advanced reactors. The three-year program has been under way since May 31, 2019, when the Company and DOE signed an interim HALEU letter agreement that allowed work to begin while the full contract was being finalized. We continue to invest in advanced technology because of the potential for future growth into new areas of business for the Company, while also preserving our unique workforce at our Technology and Manufacturing Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and our production facility in Piketon, Ohio. The Company entered into this cost-share contract with DOE as a critical first step on the road back to the commercial production of enriched uranium, which the Company had terminated in 2013 with the closure of the Paducah GDP. The HALEU Contract, once fully implemented, is expected to result in the Company having the first NRC-licensed HALEU production facility in the United States and will have demonstrated the ability to enrich uranium to a 19.75% concentration of the U-235 isotope. HALEU is expected to be required by many of the advanced reactor designs now under development, including nine out of the ten reactor designs that were selected in 2020 for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. HALEU may also be used in advanced nuclear fuels under development for the existing fleet of reactors. In addition to commercial demand, HALEU may be needed for microreactor designs that are now under development for the U.S. Department of Defense. Our HALEU Contract expires in 2022 and although we believe demand for HALEU will emerge over the next several years, there are no guarantees about whether or when government or commercial demand for HALEU will materialize, 
and there are a number of technical, regulatory and economic hurdles that must be overcome for these fuels and reactors to come to the market.
Under the HALEU Contract, DOE agreed to reimburse the Company for up to 80% of its costs incurred in performing the contract, up to a maximum of $115 million. The Company’s cost share is the corresponding 20% and any costs incurred above these amounts. Services to be provided over the three-year contract include constructing and assembling centrifuge machines and related infrastructure in a cascade formation and production of a small quantity of HALEU. When estimates of remaining program costs to be incurred for such an integrated, construction-type contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the remaining loss on the contract is recorded. A loss provision of $18.3 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. The accrued loss on the contract is being adjusted over the remaining contract term based on actual results and remaining program cost projections. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued contract loss balance was $7.7 million, and Cost of Sales in 2020 benefited by $10.6 million for previously accrued contract losses attributable to work performed in 2020. The HALEU Contract is incrementally funded and DOE is currently obligated for costs up to approximately $87.4 million of the $115 million. The Company has received aggregate cash payments of $55.8 million through December 31, 2020.
Over the past five years, our government contracts with UT-Battelle LLC (“UT-Battelle”) have provided for engineering and testing work on the American Centrifuge technology at our facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In February 2020, an additional $4.4 million fixed-price agreement was entered into with UT-Battelle. The Company, which had already begun this scope of work in 2019, completed the work during the second quarter of 2020. Revenue was $4.4 million in 2020, with approximately 58% of associated costs recognized in 2019 and 42% in 2020. 
In addition, we have entered into other contracts with DOE, other agencies and their contractors to provide engineering, design and manufacturing services.

Commercial Contracting
In March 2018, we entered into an initial services agreement with X-energy to provide technical and resource support for conceptual design of its Tri-Structural Isotropic (TRISO) fuel manufacturing process. In November 2018, we entered into a second services agreement with X-energy to proceed with Preliminary Design of the TRSIO facility. Under both agreements, which were funded by two separate cooperative agreement awards by DOE, we provide X-energy with non-cash in-kind contributions pursuant to X-energy’s obligations under those agreements. In November 2020, the parties extended the period of performance through August 2021.
Under the X-energy agreements, services are performed pursuant to separate task orders issued and provide for time-and-materials based pricing. The cumulative task orders issued through October 2020 provided payments to us of $13.7 million and in-kind contributions provided by us of $7.5 million. Under the current agreement effective November 2020, the cumulative value of the additional task orders issued provides for payments to us of $6.5 million and in-kind contributions to be provided by us of $2.8 million. 
In addition, we have entered into other contracts for engineering, design, and advanced manufacturing services with other commercial entities.
Competition and Foreign Trade
It is estimated that the enrichment industry market is currently about 50 million SWU per year. Our global market share is less than 5%. Global LEU suppliers in our highly competitive industry compete on the basis of price and reliability of supply. The four largest LEU suppliers comprise over 95% of market share combined:
•ROSATOM, a Russian government entity, which sells LEU through its wholly owned subsidiary TENEX;
•Urenco, a consortium of companies owned or controlled by the British and Dutch governments and two German utilities;
•Orano, a company largely owned by the French government that was formerly part of the French government owned company, AREVA; and
•To a lesser extent, China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (“CNEIC”), a company owned by the Chinese government.
The production capacity for ROSATOM /TENEX is estimated by the World Nuclear Association to be approximately 27 million SWU per year. Imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation are subject to restrictions as described below under —Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
Urenco reported installed capacity at its European and U.S. enrichment facilities of 18.6 million SWU per year at the end of 2019.
Orano’s gas centrifuge enrichment plant in France began commercial operations in 2011 and the plant’s nominal capacity of 7.5 million SWU was reportedly in service at the end of 2016. Orano has reported that it has suspended planned capacity expansions beyond 7.5 million SWU.
CNEIC has emerged as a significant producer primarily focused on supplying domestic requirements in China. CNEIC’s commercial SWU production capacity is estimated to be approximately 6.8 million SWU per year in 2020. 
All of our current competitors are owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by foreign governments, and operate enrichment technologies developed with the financial support of foreign governments. These competitors may make business decisions in both domestic and international markets that are influenced by political or economic policy considerations rather than exclusively by commercial considerations.
There are also producers of LEU in Japan and Brazil that primarily serve a portion of their respective domestic markets. 
LEU also may be produced by down-blending government stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly-enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from down-blended highly-enriched uranium released into the market would have a negative effect on prices for LEU.
LEU we supply to foreign customers is exported under the terms of international agreements governing nuclear cooperation between the United States and the country of destination or other entities, such as the European Union or the International Atomic Energy Agency. The LEU supplied to us is subject to the terms of cooperation agreements between the country in which the material is produced and the country of destination or other entities.
Russian Suspension Agreement
Imports into the United States of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation, including LEU imported by Centrus under the TENEX Supply Contract, are subject, through December 31, 2040, to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and December 2020, and under the RSA, as amended in 2008 and 2020. These quotas limit the amount of Russian LEU that can be imported into the United States for U.S. consumption1.
The RSA is a trade agreement between the DOC and the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation (“ROSATOM”) originally signed in 1992 that suspends an antidumping duty investigation of Russian uranium, and imposes quantitative limits on exports of Russian uranium products, including LEU, to the United States. Under an amendment signed on October 5, 2020, the RSA’s limits on shipments of Russian uranium product to the United States have been extended through at least 2040. Additionally, under legislation passed by the U.S. Congress shortly after the amendment was signed, the material terms of the extended RSA were enacted into law.
The limits imposed under the legislation and the RSA apply to the Company’s imports of Russian uranium products procured from TENEX under the TENEX Supply Contract, but as outlined below, the RSA extension agreement explicitly sets aside a portion of the available quota so that it can be used to fulfill Centrus’ supply contract. Any changes to the agreement could affect our ability to implement the TENEX Supply Contract through sales to customers who take delivery in the United States, which is our most significant market.
The amendment to the RSA signed on October 5, 2020 (and now adopted into law) limits shipments of Russian LEU to the United States to amounts that represent the following percentages of U.S. demand for SWU, as measured using an agreed formula in the RSA that relies upon the lower scenario for SWU demand published by the World Nuclear Association in its 2019 publication, “The Nuclear Fuel Report, Global Scenarios for Demand and Supply Availability 2019-2040”:

Year | Percentage of U.S. Enrichment Demand*
2021 | 24% 
2022 | 20% 
2023 | 24% 
2024-2027 | 20% per year 
2028-2040 | 15% per year 

*The annual quotas are measured by the quantity of the assay U-235 in the imported material and vary from year to year and the percentage of U.S. demand represented by each quota is determined by a methodology used by the DOC for RSA purposes. 
The RSA and the legislation provide for a revision of the quotas in 2023, 2029 and 2035 to take account of revisions of SWU demand forecasts that will be published by the WNA in the future.
The amended RSA expressly allocates a portion of the annual quotas in 2021-2028 to the Company for LEU procured through purchases of SWU from TENEX under the TENEX Supply Contract. The actual size of the annual quotas allocated to the TENEX Supply Contract are confidential, but a public version of the quotas shows that they represent a significant portion of the total quotas provided under the RSA in 2021-2028. The quotas provided for the TENEX Supply Contract are expected to be adequate to support the Company’s long term strategic goals and to permit enriched uranium procured from TENEX during the remaining term of the TENEX Supply Contract to be

imported to supply U.S. utilities, thereby securing a key part of the Company’s supply base for the benefit of its customers and providing the revenues needed by the Company to support its work on HALEU and other advanced technology projects in the United States.
At the time the most recent RSA amendment was signed, the DOC was conducting an administrative review of the current status of, and compliance with, the RSA during the period October 2017 through September 2018 (the “Second Administrative Review”). In December 2019, the DOC initiated another review of the period October 2018 through September 2019 (the “Third Administrative Review”). In these proceedings, the DOC was reviewing whether TENEX, Centrus, and others had complied with the terms of the RSA during the period of review and whether the RSA continued to meet the statutory requirements that the RSA (i) prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic uranium products and (ii) continue to be in the public interest. A determination that the RSA had been violated or did not meet the statutory requirements could have led to the termination of the RSA and the restart of an antidumping investigation from the early 1990s that could have resulted in high duties being imposed on imports of Russian uranium products, including material imported by the Company under the TENEX Supply Contract.
Following the signing of the amendment of the RSA on October 5, 2020, the DOC rescinded both the Second Administrative Review and the Third Administrative Review. At present, there are no reviews pending with respect to the RSA.

Other Trade Actions
In 2018, in connection with withdrawal by the United States from a 2015 multilateral agreement known as the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,” or JCPOA, the U.S. government re-imposed sanctions on Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) and a number of its subsidiaries. Waivers were granted to allow non-Iranian entities to continue to work on certain programs that, among other things, allowed affiliates of ROSATOM to continue work on nuclear projects in Iran. These waivers have expired or been terminated and as a result, the U.S. government could decide to impose sanctions on Russian entities who may be involved in nuclear work in Iran, including ROSATOM or its subsidiaries. These sanctions could affect companies owned by ROSATOM, including TENEX, even if they are not doing work in Iran. To date, no sanctions have been imposed or announced on TENEX or any other ROSATOM subsidiary involved in implementation of the TENEX Supply Contract.
If TENEX or its affiliate that produces LEU for delivery under the TENEX Supply Contract were sanctioned and if the sanctions precluded the Company from purchasing LEU from TENEX, the Company would seek a license, waiver or other approval from the U.S. government to ensure that the Company could continue to fulfill its purchase and sales obligations. There is no assurance that such a license, waiver or approval would be granted. If a license, waiver or approval were not granted, the Company would need to look to alternative sources of LEU to replace the LEU that it could not procure from TENEX, and to the extent these sources were insufficient or more expensive, it would adversely impact our business, results of operations, and competitive position.
DOE Facilities
We produced LEU through 2001 at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Portsmouth GDP”) in Piketon, Ohio and through 2013 at the former Paducah GDP in Paducah, Kentucky which we had leased from DOE. We currently store our existing inventory at third party offsite licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. The Portsmouth GDP and Paducah GDP were operated by agencies of the U.S. government for more than 40 years prior to the creation of the Company through privatization of the Government enterprise in 1998. As a result of such operation, there are contamination and other potential environmental liabilities associated with the Government’s prior operation of the plants. The USEC Privatization Act and our former leases for the plants provide that DOE remains responsible for the D&D of the gaseous diffusion plants. Further, DOE continued operations and cleanup activities both during and subsequent to our operations at the plants.
We lease facilities and related personal property in Piketon, Ohio from DOE. In connection with the HALEU letter agreement, DOE and Centrus amended the lease agreement, which was scheduled to expire by its terms on June 30, 2019. The lease was renewed and extended until May 31, 2022. Any facilities or equipment constructed or installed under contract with DOE will be owned by DOE and may be returned to DOE in an “as is” condition at the end of the lease term. DOE will be responsible for the D&D of any returned facilities or equipment. If we determine the equipment and facilities may benefit Centrus after completion of the HALEU program, we can extend the facility lease and ownership of the equipment will be transferred to us, subject to mutual agreement regarding D&D and other issues.
