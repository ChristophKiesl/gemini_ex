Company Overview
Ameresco is a leading clean technology integrator with a comprehensive portfolio of energy efficiency and renewable energy supply solutions.
Our core services include the development, design, arrangement of financing, construction, and installation of solutions that deliver measurable cost and energy savings while enhancing the operations, energy security, infrastructure, and resiliency of a facility. These solutions range from upgrades to a facility’s energy infrastructure to the development, construction and operation of renewable energy plants. As a trusted sustainability partner, we are always on a mission to help customers lower their overall carbon footprint and reduce their environmental impact.
Our product independence coupled with our deep technical bench allows us to integrate best-in-class advanced technology solutions for the unique needs of each customer.
Drawing from decades of experience, we develop these tailored energy projects for federal, state and local governments, educational and healthcare institutions, airports, public housing authorities, and commercial/industrial clients across North America and the U.K.
We have sourced and raised more than $3.5 billion in project financing while delivering $10 billion in energy solutions since our inception. Our growth is driven by staying ahead of the curve and at the leading edge of innovation taking place in the energy sector, offering new products and services to new and existing customers. In 2020, we launched our first owned and operated wind power project in Ireland, that became our first renewable energy asset outside of North America. Strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets have been an important part of our growth enabling us to broaden our service offerings and expand our geographical reach. Over the past three years we have acquired businesses and energy assets under construction in Washington DC, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Illinois and Connecticut.
To best serve our expansive client base, we have approximately 70 regional offices located throughout North America and the United Kingdom and more than 1,100 dedicated energy and business professionals with years of proven experience and a strong commitment to customer satisfaction. We offer our customers the resources needed to successfully plan, finance, execute and operate the energy program that will create real, sustained economic and operating benefits to fulfill their unique requirements.
Our Services
Our portfolio of services aims to create value and provide energy efficient and renewable solutions to the organizations we serve in the pursuit of a sustainable future.
A core service for Ameresco is the development, design, engineering, and installation of projects that reduce the energy and operations and maintenance (“O&M”) costs of our customers’ facilities. These projects generally include a variety of measures that incorporate innovative technology and techniques, customized for the facility and designed to improve the efficiency of major building systems, such as heating, ventilation, cooling and lighting systems, while enhancing the comfort and usability of the buildings. These measures and upgrades may include a combination of the following:
•light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting
•water reclamation
•smart metering
•intelligent micro-grids
•the installation of renewable energy, such as solar photovoltaic (“PV”)
•battery storage
•central utility plants (for example chillers, boilers, etc.)
•combined heat and power (“CHP”)
We also offer the ability to incorporate analytical tools that provide improved building energy management capabilities and enable customers to identify opportunities for energy cost savings. We typically commit to customers that our energy efficiency projects will satisfy agreed upon performance standards upon installation or achieve specified increases in energy efficiency. In most cases, the forecasted lifetime energy and operating cost savings of the energy efficiency measures we install will defray all or almost all of the cost of such measures. In many cases, we assist customers in obtaining third-party financing, grants or rebates for the cost of constructing the facility improvements, resulting in little or no upfront capital expenditure by the customer. After a 
project is complete, we may operate, maintain and repair the customer’s energy systems under a multi-year O&M contract, which provides us with recurring revenue and visibility into the customer’s evolving needs.
In addition, we serve certain customers by developing and building small-scale renewable energy plants located at or close to a customer’s site. Depending on the customer’s preference, we will either retain ownership of the completed plant or build it for the customer. Most of our small-scale renewable energy plants to date consist of solar PV installations and plants constructed adjacent to landfills, that use landfill gas (“LFG”) to generate energy. We have also designed and built, as well as own, operate and maintain, plants that utilize biogas from wastewater treatment processes. Our largest renewable energy project that we operate for a customer uses biomass as the primary source of energy. For information on how we finance the projects that we own and operate, please see the disclosures under Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, Note 9, “Debt and Financing Lease Liabilities” and Note 11, “Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Our Lines of Business
Projects
Our Projects service is primarily energy efficiency projects, which entail the design, engineering and installation of an ever-increasing array of innovative technologies and techniques to improve the energy efficiency and control the operation, of a building’s energy- and water- consuming systems. In certain projects we provide financing and design and construct a central plant or cogeneration system providing power, heat and/or cooling to a building, or a small-scale plant that produces electricity, gas, heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy for a customer. Our projects generally range in size and scope from a one-month project to design and retrofit a lighting system to a more complex 30-month project to design and install a central plant or cogeneration system or other small-scale plant. Projects we have constructed or are currently working on include designing, engineering and installing energy conservation measures across school buildings, large, complex energy conservation and energy security projects for the federal government, and municipal-scale street lighting projects incorporating smart city controls.
O&M
After an energy efficiency or renewable energy project is completed, we often provide ongoing O&M services under multi-year contracts. These services offer end-to-end technical guidance and include operating, maintaining, and repairing facility energy systems, such as boilers, chillers and building controls, as well as central power and other small-scale plants. For larger projects, we frequently maintain staff on-site to perform these services. In addition to providing O&M services for our own projects, we also provide similar services on projects we did not construct for various customers.
Energy Assets
Our service offerings also include the sale of electricity, heat, cooling, processed biogas, and renewable biomethane fuel from the portfolio of assets that we own and operate. 
We have constructed and are currently developing, designing, and constructing a wide range of renewable energy plants using:
•biogas (generated from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and the agricultural sector)
•advanced biofuels
•biomass and other bio-derived fuels
•solar PV
•wind and hydro sources of energy 
Most of our renewable energy assets to date have involved the generation and sale of:
•electricity from solar PV
•electricity, thermal, renewable fuel, or biomethane using biogas as a feedstock 
In the case of our biogas-fueled projects, we purchase the biogas that otherwise would be combusted or vented, process it, and either use it as a renewable fuel source in our energy plants to produce and sell electricity and/or thermal, or sell it as a renewable fuel source to a third party. We have also designed and built, as well as own, operate and maintain, facilities that process biogas into biomethane (or renewable natural gas or “RNG”) that can be transported, primarily through the nation’s natural gas pipeline grid or in some cases through tanker trucks, and sold to third parties. For Ameresco-owned and operated energy assets, we typically enter into long-term agreements with third parties for the sale of the energy produced by the facility.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 130 small-scale renewable energy plants and solar PV installations which generate electricity or deliver renewable gas fuel with a combined capacity of 282 megawatt equivalents (“MWe”). We also have energy assets in development and construction with a combined capacity of 351 MWe. 
The table below shows the type and number of plants we owned as of December 31, 2020:

Plants Owned and Operated | Quantity
Biogas: RNG | 4 
Biogas: non-RNG | 26 
Solar Assets | 98 
Other | 2 
Total plants owned and operated | 130 

Other
Our service and product offerings also include photovoltaic solar energy products and systems (“integrated-PV”) and consulting and enterprise energy management services.
Customer Arrangements
Energy Savings Performance Contracts (“ESPCs”)
For our energy efficiency projects, we typically enter into ESPCs, under which we agree to develop, design, engineer and construct a project and also commit that the project will satisfy agreed upon performance standards that vary from project to project. These performance commitments are typically based on the design, capacity, efficiency or operation of the specific equipment and systems we install. Our commitments generally fall into three categories: 
•Pre-agreed energy reduction commitment: our customer reviews the project design in advance and agrees that, upon or shortly after completion of installation of the specified equipment comprising the project, the commitment will have been met.
•Equipment-level commitment: we commit to a level of energy use reduction based on the difference in use measured first with the existing equipment and then with the replacement equipment.
•Whole building-level commitment: requires demonstration of energy usage reduction for a whole building, often based on readings of the utility meter where usage is measured. Depending on the project, the measurement and demonstration may be required only once, upon installation, based on an analysis of one or more sample installations, or may be required to be repeated at agreed upon intervals generally over periods of up to 25 years. We often assist these customers in identifying and obtaining financing through rebate programs, grant programs, third-party lenders, and other sources.
Under our contracts, we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside of our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations. These factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates, weather, facility occupancy schedules, the amount of energy-using equipment in a facility, and the failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly. Typically, our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures. Therefore, to the extent an individual measure underperforms, it may be offset by other measures that overperform during the same period. In the event that an energy efficiency project does not perform according to the agreed upon specifications, our agreements typically allow us to satisfy our obligation by adjusting or modifying the installed equipment, installing additional measures to provide substitute energy savings or paying the customer for lost energy savings based on the assumed conditions specified in the agreement. Many of our equipment supply, local design and installation subcontracts contain provisions that enable us to seek recourse against our vendors or subcontractors if there is a deficiency in our energy reduction commitment. See “We may have liability to our customers under our ESPCs if our projects fail to deliver the energy use reductions to which we are committed under the contract” in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) Agreements
The projects that we perform for governmental agencies are governed by particular qualification and contracting regimes. Certain states require qualification with an appropriate state agency as a precondition to performing work or appearing as a qualified energy service provider for state, county and local agencies within the state. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the states of Colorado and Washington pre-qualify energy service providers and provide contract documents that serve as the starting point for negotiations with potential governmental clients. Most of the work that we perform for the federal government is performed under IDIQ agreements between government agencies and us or our subsidiaries. These IDIQ agreements allow us to 
contract with the relevant agencies to implement energy projects, but no work may be performed unless we and the agency agree on a task order or delivery order governing the provision of a specific project. The government agencies enter into contracts for specific projects on a competitive basis. Ameresco and our subsidiaries and affiliates are currently party to an IDIQ agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy expiring April 2022, which may be extended through December 2023.
Payments by the federal government for energy efficiency measures are based on the services provided and the products installed, but are limited to the savings derived from such measures, calculated in accordance with federal regulatory guidelines and the specific contract’s terms. The savings are typically determined by comparing energy use and other costs before and after the installation of the energy efficiency measures, adjusted for changes that affect energy use and other costs but are not caused by the energy efficiency measures.
Energy Supply Contracts
For projects involving the construction of a small-scale renewable energy plant that we own and operate, we generally enter into (i) long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) to supply electricity, (ii) long-term energy supply agreements (“ESAs”) to supply medium BTU biogas or thermal energy, or (iii) gas purchase agreements (“GPAs”) to supply renewable natural gas to a third party. These third parties include, but are not limited to, brokers, traders, utilities, municipalities, industrial facilities, or other large purchasers of energy. The rights to use the site for the plant and the purchase of raw feedstock fuel for the plant are also obtained by us under long-term agreements with terms at least as long as the associated output supply agreement. Our supply agreements typically provide for fixed prices or prices that escalate at a fixed rate or vary based on a market benchmark. See “We may assume responsibility under customer contracts for factors outside our control, including, in connection with some customer projects, the risk that fuel prices will increase” in reference Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Our Business Segments
Our reportable business segments are as follows:
•U.S. Regions
•U.S. Federal
•Canada
•Non-Solar Distributed Generation (“Non-Solar DG”)

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach is to offer customers customized and comprehensive energy efficiency solutions tailored to meet their economic, operational and technical needs. The sales, design and construction process for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects recently has been averaging from 18 to 54 months. We identify project opportunities through referrals, requests for proposals (“RFPs”), conferences and events, website, digital campaigns, telemarketing, and repeat business from existing customers. Our direct sales force develops and follows up on customer leads. As of December 31, 2020, we had 135 employees in direct sales.
In preparation for a proposal, our team typically conducts a preliminary audit of the customer’s needs and requirements and identifies areas to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs. We collect and analyze the customer’s utility bill and other data related to energy use. If the bills are complex or numerous, we often utilize Ameresco’s enterprise energy management software tools to scan, compile and analyze the information. Our experienced engineers visit and assess the customer’s current energy systems and infrastructure. Through our knowledge of the federal, state, local governmental and utility environment, we assess the availability of energy, utility or environmental-based payments for usage reductions or renewable power generation, which helps us optimize the economic benefits of a proposed project for a customer. Once awarded a project, we perform a more detailed audit of the customer’s facilities, which serves as the basis for the final specifications of the project and final contract terms.
For renewable energy plants that are not located on a customer’s site or use sources of energy not within the customer’s control, the sales process also involves the identification of sites with attractive sources of renewable energy and obtaining necessary rights and governmental permits to develop a plant on that site. For example, for LFG projects, we start with gaining control of an LFG resource located close to the prospective customer. For solar and wind projects, we look for sites where utilities are interested in purchasing renewable energy power at rates that are sufficient to make a project feasible. Where governmental agencies control the site and resource, such as a landfill owned by a municipality, the customer may be required to issue an RFP to use the site or resource. Once we believe we are likely to obtain the rights to the site and the resource, we seek customers for the energy output of the potential project, with whom we can enter into a long-term PPA.
Customers
We strive to be a trusted sustainability partner creating valued, single-sourced, efficient energy solutions delivered with passion, expertise, teamwork, and a relentless focus on customer satisfaction.
Our customers choose to prioritize efficiency and the development of clean, green energy sources and our solutions are customized to serve the specific needs of each customer and meaningfully reduce or offset their carbon footprint. From energy conservation through a variety of measures to generation of green, renewable power, our clients and their communities reap the benefits of reducing energy consumption, costs, and associated carbon emissions.
In 2020, we served customers throughout the United States, Canada, the U.K., and Greece and approximately 71.5% of our revenues were derived from federal, state, provincial or local government entities, including public housing authorities and public universities. Our federal customers include various divisions of the U.S. federal government. The U.S. federal government is considered a single customer and segment for reporting purposes (see table above under “Our Segments”). For the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest 20 customers accounted for approximately 62.4% of our total revenues. Other than the U.S. federal government, no one customer represented more than 10% of our revenues during this period.
See “Provisions in our government contracts may harm our business, financial condition and operating results” in Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of special considerations applicable to government contracting.
Competition
While we face significant competition from a large number of companies, we believe few offer the objective technical expertise and full range of services that we provide.
Our principal competitors include:
•Core business: Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (an Exelon company), Energy Systems Group, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, NORESCO United Technologies, Schneider Electric, Siemens Building Technologies, and Trane Technologies (an Ingersoll-Rand company). We compete primarily on the basis of our comprehensive, independent offering of energy efficiency and renewable energy services and the breadth and depth of our expertise.
•Renewable energy plants: many large independent power producers and utilities, as well as a large number of developers of renewable energy projects.
•LFG market: primarily large, national project developers and owners of landfills who self-develop projects using LFG from their own landfills. 
•Solar PV market: Borrego Solar, BlueWave Solar, Citizens Energy, Clean Energy Collective, Nexamp, SunPower Corp., Solect Energy, and Syncarpha Capital. We compete for renewable energy projects primarily on the basis of our experience, reputation and ability to identify and complete high quality and cost-effective projects.
•O&M services: EMCOR Energy Services, Comfort Systems USA, Honeywell, Johnson Controls and Veolia. In this area, we compete primarily on the basis of our expertise and quality of service.
See “We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our current or future competitors may be able to compete more effectively than we do, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, growth rates and market share” in Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of competition.
Regulatory
Various regulations affect the conduct of our business. Federal and state legislation and regulations enable us to enter into ESPCs with government agencies in the United States. The applicable regulatory requirements for ESPCs differ in each state and between agencies of the federal government.
Our projects must conform to all applicable electric reliability, building and safety, and environmental regulations and codes, which vary from place to place and time to time. Various federal, state, provincial and local permits are required to construct an energy efficiency project or renewable energy plant.
Renewable energy projects are also subject to specific governmental safety and economic regulation. States and the federal government typically do not regulate the transportation or sale of LFG unless it is combined with and distributed with natural gas, but this is not uniform among states and may change from time to time. States regulate the retail sale and distribution of natural gas to end-users, although regulatory exemptions from regulation are available in some states for limited gas delivery activities, such as sales only to a single customer. The sale and distribution of electricity at the retail level is subject to state and provincial regulation, and the sale and transmission of electricity at the wholesale level is subject to federal regulation. While we do not own or operate retail-level electric distribution systems or wholesale-level transmission systems, the prices for the products we offer can be affected by the tariffs, rules and regulations applicable to such systems, as well as the prices that the owners of such systems are able to charge. The construction of power generation projects typically is regulated at the state and provincial levels, and the operation of these projects also may be subject to state and provincial regulation as “utilities.” At the federal level, the ownership and operation of, and sale of power from, generation facilities may be subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA”), the Federal Power Act (“FPA”), and Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”). However, because all of the plants that we have constructed and operated to date are small power “qualifying facilities” under PURPA, they are subject to less regulation under the FPA, PUHCA and related state utility laws than traditional utilities.
If we pursue projects employing different technologies or with a single project electrical capacity greater than 20 megawatts, we could become subject to some of the regulatory schemes which do not apply to our current projects. In addition, the state, provincial and federal regulations that govern qualifying facilities and other power sellers frequently change, and the effect of these changes on our business cannot be predicted.
LFG power generation facilities require an air emissions permit, which may be difficult to obtain in certain jurisdictions. See “Compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our operating results” in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Renewable energy projects may also be eligible for certain governmental or government-related incentives from time to time, including tax credits, cash payments in lieu of tax credits, and the ability to sell associated environmental attributes, including carbon credits. Government incentives and mandates typically vary by jurisdiction.
Some of the demand reduction services we provide for utilities and institutional clients are subject to regulatory tariffs imposed under federal and state utility laws. In addition, the operation of, and electrical interconnection for, our renewable energy projects are subject to federal, state or provincial interconnection and federal reliability standards also set forth in utility tariffs. These tariffs specify rules, business practices and economic terms to which we are subject. The tariffs are drafted by the utilities and approved by the utilities’ state, provincial or federal regulatory commissions.
Human Capital Management 
We believe our employees are Ameresco’s greatest resource, as they come together to creatively integrate our advanced technology portfolio and develop innovative, transformative energy solutions for our customers.
The diversity of our team coupled with our deep bench of technical expertise enables us to tackle the most complex energy opportunities. Supporting our employees and the communities in which we serve is paramount to our success.

We actively participate in philanthropic activities that support our local communities and provide an opportunity for dynamic team building. As we move into 2021, employees will be encouraged to use paid community service days to donate time and creative energy to the organizations that touch them personally and to give back to the environment and their communities.
Diversity and Inclusion
We welcome, support, and celebrate unique ways of thinking. We believe innovation demands diversity of thought, and Ameresco has done well by welcoming and celebrating employees from diverse backgrounds. We are proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and an Affirmative Action employer.
To educate, support, and promote the culture of diversity and inclusion at Ameresco, annual Diversity in the Workplace training is rolled out to all Ameresco employees. This comprehensive training is critical to ensuring we are doing our best in educating all of our teams and fostering a corporate culture that is all-inclusive.
Recruiting is a key element in our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Our recruiting team focuses on attracting and recruiting a diverse workforce by partnering with organizations like National Society of Black Engineers, New England Women in Energy and the Environment, Hire Heroes, USA and National Council for Minorities in Engineering.
We have demonstrated meaningful growth over the last five years in number and percentage of employees from key protected classes, representing 43% of all employees as of December 31, 2020. In addition, we have a 42% rolling three-year average of key protected class promotions among all promotions throughout Ameresco. In 2020, 43% of all management position promotions were employees in a key protected class. Key protected classes include women, ethnicity, veterans, and individuals with a disability. This data represents U.S. employees only due to personal information privacy regulations in Canada and Europe.
Benefits with a Purpose
The health, safety, and well-being of our employees is our top priority at Ameresco. In addition to competitive salaries, we are committed to regularly evaluating a competitive benefits portfolio, striving to provide resources to our employees that assist with work-life balance.
While employee healthcare costs and access to a wide variety of doctors have always been at the top of our criteria list, we also focused our 2021 benefit renewal objectives on expanding our mental health offerings. We wanted to ensure our employees have a variety of help and resources available, offered in platforms and services they felt comfortable using, should they need it.
In addition, we are proud to offer a comprehensive Employee Assistance Plan to all Ameresco employees and their family members should they need assistance with any life planning matters. And in support of some of the new applications and corporate programs, we are rolling out memberships to Care.com, Gympass, and the Headspace mobile app.
Energy Outside the Office
Whether it is through our philanthropic activities, our quest to provide an inclusive culture, or our focus on the well-being of our people, Ameresco benefits from the open communication seen between our employees. We encourage activities outside of our offices to enhance the employee experience. Various social groups have organically formed based on interests and hobbies ranging from hiking to baking and reading to running.
More recently with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to keep employees engaged while working remotely, our Canadian offices organized weekly midday virtual yoga sessions and recurring virtual trivia games.
Career Advancement
Ameresco strives to implement creative ways for our employees to support career advancement. Lunch & Learn educational sessions are hosted regularly by departments across the company to better understand all aspects of our business. This allows 
employees to learn about topics relevant to our business and contributes to cross departmental collaboration and individual employee development. 
To further encourage females in key leadership positions, a Women’s Mentorship Forum was created to mentor rising stars at Ameresco. In the last five years, Ameresco has promoted 15 females into key leadership positions. 
Ameresco has a tuition reimbursement program to support career development within our organization. In addition, we support employee growth by investing in career advancing certification programs for our employees.
