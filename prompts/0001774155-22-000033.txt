ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Billtrust is a leading provider of cloud-based software and integrated payment processing solutions that simplify and automate business-to-business (“B2B”) commerce. For businesses around the world, there is a high degree of cost, risk, and complexity in timely receiving cash and recognizing revenue; Billtrust solves these problems by addressing both sides of the payment equation, delivering an order-to-cash platform that spans credit-to-cash application and collection, integrated with an open network connecting the B2B payments ecosystem. 
 Our solution is at the forefront of the ongoing digital transformation of accounts receivable (“AR”), providing mission-critical solutions that span credit decisioning and monitoring, online ordering, invoicing, cash application, and collections. Our Business Payments Network (“BPN”) connects B2B buyers and sellers to a community of banks, FinTechs, and card brands. Billtrust automates payments from digital lockbox to final posting in ERP, bridging receivables with buyers’ payment processes so sellers can manage cash flow more strategically and make it easier for customers to do business with them.
Customers use our software as a service (“SaaS”) platform to transition from expensive paper invoicing and check acceptance to efficient electronic billing and payments, simplifying and accelerating transactions. Our scalable platform lets our customers maximize straight-through processing of invoicing, payments, and cash application while also reducing headcount. The machine learning capabilities and rules engine within our SaaS platform continuously evolve to solve order-to-cash challenges and deliver a higher rate of touchless transactions. We work with industry-leading security partners and take proactive steps to keep data secure from threats. 
Collectively our platform reduces the complexity of B2B commerce for our customers. According to a 2019 Billentis report, there are over 280 billion annual invoices globally, but a significant proportion of B2B payments are still made by paper check. As we drive electronic invoice adoption, there is a significant opportunity to monetize electronic payments, which further expands our network in a virtuous cycle. According to Visa’s 2019 annual report, there is over $120 trillion of global B2B payment volume, and, according to a 2018 MasterCard report, over 50% of B2B payments are still made by paper check. Compounding this problem, there has been a recent proliferation of accounts payable (“AP”) software providers focused on enrolling suppliers in their network, which forces suppliers to post invoices into multiple AP portals. In addition, AP software providers are promoting acceptance of electronic payments, including single-use virtual cards, which has added stress and complexity to supplier AR systems.
 Our secure, proprietary platform offers customers multiple ways to present invoices (online, email, AP portal, and print/mail) and receive payments (credit card, automated clearing house (“ACH”), email, phone and paper check). Our electronic solutions (“eSolutions”) team works closely with our customers to transition their users from paper invoices and payments to electronic, which results in accelerated savings, faster realization of cash, a reduced environmental footprint, and a better user experience. In turn, we benefit from margin expansion and incremental revenue through the monetization of electronic payments. We help customers prioritize which problems to solve, regularly assess ROI, optimize the impact of digitization across processes, and drive more value for their companies, allowing AR teams to play a more strategic role in moving a business forward.
 In 2017, we created the BPN, which is a powerful network that connects buyers, suppliers, and financial institutions to simplify and streamline the process of accepting electronic payments. Most order-to-cash solutions focus too narrowly on just AR, leaving out the rest of the B2B payments ecosystem. The BPN was developed to extend a company’s order-to-cash functionality to all the buyers and third parties that require interactions with their AR team, allowing them to achieve unprecedented levels of digital payments thus simplifying and accelerating invoicing and payments acceptance. The BPN has built-in integrations with leading ERP and accounting systems, AP software providers, payment card issuers, and payment acceptance networks. The BPN offers a supplier business directory, programmatic payment preferences, payment acceptance flexibility, and streamlined reconciliation of remittance data.
As of December 31, 2021, over 2,400 enterprise and middle market customers use or are being onboarded to our platform to help them manage their AR operations and process payments. We have 
customers across diversified industry verticals, including technology, healthcare, industrial, wholesale distribution, consumer packaged goods, and others. Our customers include many of the largest Fortune 500 companies, as well as high-growth Fortune 1,000 and middle market businesses. Generally, our customers are in high-bill volume industries with complex billing needs, including those with a diverse customer base, multiple distribution channels, and numerous product SKUs. Our technology, distribution, and support can be configured to the specific billing and payment needs of customers in each of these verticals.
 Our go-to-market strategy is highly targeted, including market-directed demand generation strategies and a direct sales organization. We acquire customers through targeted account-based marketing, content-rich marketing campaigns, and referrals from channel partners and customers. Our target customers are enterprise and middle market B2B businesses with at least $50 million in annual revenue. As of December 31, 2021, our channel partners included several of the largest financial institutions in the United States, including J.P. Morgan Chase, as well as a growing network of referral and reseller partners. We make our software accessible by integrating with leading ERP systems and accounting system vendors, including Oracle, SAP, Infor, Epicor, Microsoft, and Sage. In addition to financial institutions, we have strategic relationships across the BPN, most notably with Visa, as well as strategic relationships with AP software providers, including AvidXchange, Inc. (“AvidXchange”), FIS, Comdata, and Finexio.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we derived approximately 62% of our total revenue and 79% of our net revenue (non-GAAP) from a combination of software and payments fees paid by our customers, which primarily include recurring monthly subscription fees, transaction processing fees, and a percentage of payment volume processed for certain payment transactions. We also earn professional service fees that are typically based on contracted hourly rates, which represented approximately 6% of our total revenues and 8% of our net revenues (non-GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2021. A high percentage of our revenue is recurring because of the subscription nature of our SaaS platform offerings and the consistency of B2B transaction volumes and payments. We maintain outstanding customer and revenue retention rates due to our focus on and commitment to customer success, the high-quality, mission-critical, and embedded nature of our solutions, and the disruption and high switching costs associated with these solutions.
We have grown and scaled our business operations rapidly in recent periods. We processed $77.7 billion in total payment volume, of which $27.5 billion was for credit card payment volume in 2021, which represented 42% and 55% year-over-year growth, respectively. Our total revenues were $166.4 million and $145.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our net revenue (non-GAAP) was $131.6 million and $108.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We incurred net losses of $61.2 million and $17.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our top 10 customers, with an average relationship length of approximately seven years, contributed to approximately 19% and 20% of total revenues during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively and approximately 18% and 17% of net revenue (non-GAAP) during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this measure and a reconciliation of net revenue (non-GAAP) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total revenues, refer to the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Industry Overview
•Huge Market. According to Visa, B2B commerce drives approximately two-thirds of global payments. The transactions between businesses annually generate 280 billion global invoices and an associated $120+ trillion of global commercial payments. Conventional AR processes for B2B invoicing and payment are highly dated and ripe for disruption. To illustrate, in the United States alone, more than 50% of payments are still being made by paper check, presenting a huge market opportunity for digital transformation. We believe our global total addressable market for digital transformation of accounts receivables with integrated payments is extremely large, and estimate that in North America alone the total addressable market is approximately $10.9 billion, based on an estimated 43,500 businesses with annual revenues of $50 million or more in the United States and Canada that are in industries that use our products and services and with a potential estimated annual revenue of approximately $250,000 for each such business, which is our estimated representative annual spend for customers that fully utilize our platform.
•Favorable Trends. The need for modern, digital invoice presentment and payment acceptance is fueled by B2B buyers and governments. B2B commerce is increasingly digital, with the global B2B e-
commerce market size estimated to reach $20.9 trillion by 2027. Rapid adoption of SaaS platform AP solutions like AvidXchange, Coupa, and Bill.com by B2B buyers creates complexity for supplier AR departments, requiring manual activity for invoice presentment, remittance capture, and electronic payment processing. In addition, governments are requiring B2B sellers to interact with electronic tax validation systems in order to present invoices. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for faster and more efficient digital B2B interactions. Companies need solutions that enable AR professionals to work outside of the office, generate cost and environmental savings from operational efficiency, address increased pressure on working capital, and provide a superior customer experience. Our platform addresses such challenges and is poised to benefit from these favorable industry conditions.
•Key Market Challenges. Finance leaders globally are tasked with digitally transforming their AR processes. Major AR-related challenges listed by finance leaders include high operating expenses, insufficient speed of receiving and applying cash, working capital tied up by high days sales outstanding (“DSO”), and costly manual labor with high risk of errors. In addition, for their businesses to remain competitive, finance leaders also increasingly seek to provide a differentiated experience to their business customers, including self-service capabilities, integrated payments, automated interaction with AP portals, and real-time customer credit insights to enable faster transactions.
Sending invoices via mail and manually processing paper checks and remittance is labor intensive and costly, and exposes businesses to risk from third parties like postal services. Businesses that have not automated their collections processes are unable to drive process consistency across teams, effectively optimize account targeting, or systematically execute multi-touch campaigns to increase recoveries. AR leaders are under pressure to address these inefficiencies, with seven out of ten in the United States indicating they plan to adopt accounts receivables automation solutions by 2023.
There is a new generation of companies focused on B2B automation, and we have been a leader in this field since Factor Systems, Inc. (dba Billtrust) (“Legacy Billtrust”) was incorporated in 2001.
What Sets Us Apart
Our platform enables our customers to do what they do best, run their businesses, and it provides the following key benefits:
•Billtrust Deploys Great Software. Our cloud-based AR platform was purpose-built for enterprise and mid-market customers spanning more than 40 industry verticals. Our powerful and proprietary technology platform combines cloud-based software and integrated payments capabilities to create end-to-end B2B commerce solutions for our customers. Our solutions are mission-critical and used by millions of users. Our software is highly configurable based on business needs, with capabilities covering credit, ordering, invoicing, payments, cash application and collections. We provide customers with a unified and mobile platform that seamlessly integrates with their ERP systems for real-time pricing, availability, processing, and tracking.
•Powerful Order-to-Cash Platform Enabling Better B2B Transactions. Our scalable order-to-cash platform lets customers maximize straight-through processing of invoicing, payments, and cash application, regardless of how many transactions they process each day. Our platform enables customers to bridge AR with their buyers’ payment processes, so they can manage cash flow more strategically and make it easier for customers to do business with them.
•Extensive Ecosystem Integrations. The digital transformation of AR requires integration with various participants, including AP portals, banks, ERP systems, and other independent software vendors. Our platform seamlessly connects with these participants. Many of these participants have different standards and protocols, and it is a challenge for suppliers to satisfy and maintain their interoperability as standards and protocols change over time. Our robust integrations and partner ecosystem enable businesses to send and receive invoices and payments the way they want. For example, connect to over 170 leading AP portals to automatically deliver invoices, enabling AR professionals to avoid the labor and expense of manually keying invoice data.
•Integrated Payments with Frictionless Money Movement Capabilities. The ultimate objective of AR is to receive and apply payments quickly and efficiently. Our platform enables payment acceptance and remittance capture to be achieved across various touchpoints. We support multiple payment modalities as well as a wide variety of currencies. Additionally, we help our customers 
comply with various regulations including those related to privacy, anti-money laundering (“AML”), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
•Generate High Customer Return on Investment with a Short Payback Period. We are focused on driving business outcomes by reducing risk and complexity involved in our customers getting paid. Our solutions automate AR departments, accelerate cash flow, minimize personnel-hours, reduce processing and compliance costs, and help our customers scale more efficiently. We achieve these results for our customers by optimizing across credit, order, invoicing, payments, cash application and collections functions. We have a dedicated customer success team that helps our customers deploy best practices and uses a data-driven campaign-based approach to rapidly drive our customers’ customers to adopt electronic solutions. Our eSolutions programs drive significantly more usage of electronic invoice delivery and payments and provide greater cost savings for our customers than organizations trying to do it on their own.
•Business Payments Network (BPN): Removing Friction from B2B Transactions to Bridge AR and AP. Our BPN extends the functionality of our platform by connecting our customers’ payment process to anyone, anywhere, regardless of whether they are a Billtrust customer. The BPN is a unique, two-sided B2B payments network that brings together suppliers and buyers in a highly efficient manner. According to a 2018 Mastercard report, more than 50% of B2B payments are still done by paper check and via manual processes. Our proprietary “Digital Lockbox” combines payments and remittance data from multiple sources, accelerating payments and dramatically decreasing manual cash application processes. As an open network, the BPN provides broad support for the payments industry and currently integrates with 170 AP providers and banks with its open network approach.
Growth Strategies
We take a multi-pronged approach to growing our business. Some of the key elements include:
•New Customer Acquisition. We have an opportunity to further scale sales and marketing activities to acquire new logos in both the mid-market and enterprise space. By investing in demand generation and account-based marketing programs and broadening our sales coverage teams, we can increase the quantity of new sales opportunities and resultant conversions to customers. We also continue to grow through the volume of referrals from existing partners and customers who provide us with an additional pipeline of prospects.
•Cross and Up-sell to Existing Customers. The breadth of our platform enables a land-and-expand approach to increasing customer value. Customers generally contract for a subset of available modules and then expand as they progress on their digital transformation journey. In addition, newly acquired customers may begin with one operating division or subsidiary company creating a meaningful opportunity to increase the value delivered and resultant revenue to us by cross-selling to other business units within a corporate entity. Our annual customer revenue churn rate of approximately 3% or less over the last three years demonstrates the sticky nature of our customer relationships and our software and payments net dollar retention rate of greater than 100% evidences the opportunity for expanded growth within the existing customer base.
•Monetize Payments. The B2B payments space is ripe for digital transformation, and we have a compelling opportunity to increase our volume of payments processed and further monetize a larger proportion of transactions as they shift to digital methods from paper check. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the monetary volume associated with invoice data processed across our various modules was over $1.0 trillion. We directly processed approximately $77.7 billion in electronic payments on behalf of our customers over the same time period. As more customers shift to accepting digital payments, we will monetize this increased activity through higher subscription and merchant processing revenue. This accelerating shift to digital payments across B2B fuels revenue growth opportunities with existing customers, new logos, and within the BPN for us.
•Scale the BPN. We believe the BPN is currently the leading open payments network in the B2B space. Our relationship with Visa provides distribution into multiple bank channels, and when combined with the growing count of participating AP entities, the BPN is serves as “the predominant rails” for B2B payments. As our customers and their end customers connect through the BPN, our member network organically expands, and we are able to monetize different parts of the network and increase revenue from the BPN. We charge fees when AP providers send payments, when suppliers receive 
payments, and when we process payments through our payment facilitator merchant processing solution. We expect the BPN to provide significant revenue growth opportunities.
•Scaling Revenue through Partnerships. We’ve built relationships in three sectors that will continue to be avenues for growth: (1) Financial institutions, including banks and card networks, (2) Technology providers, including software developers, ERPs, and FinTech firms, and (3) Industry, services, and consulting organizations, including value added resellers (“VARs”), software integrators (“SIs”), industry associations, and consulting companies.
•Expand into New Geographies. The market for global invoicing services is significant, with over 280 billion annual invoices delivered worldwide. In 2021, we began to execute our strategy for expanding globally to take advantage of that opportunity by acquiring iController BV, part of the groundwork for a strong expansion into Europe in 2022.
•Strategic M&A. In addition to growing our business organically, we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to increase market share, enhance solutions and capabilities, and expand internationally, as was demonstrated by the acquisition of iController BV in 2021. We have a proven track record of successfully sourcing, acquiring, and integrating acquisitions, which has enhanced our growth and has helped build out our end-to-end platform. Our dedicated team of corporate development professionals and deep experience in M&A favorably position us for success in this area.
Our Platform and Solutions
We are an established leader in the digital transformation of AR and B2B payments, with what we believe (based on publicly available information and company research) is the largest customer base of any North American company focused on driving digital transformation across AR with integrated payments. Our proprietary SaaS platform enables modern AR that makes getting paid simpler for our customers and includes a comprehensive B2B payments solution. Modules include credit decisioning and monitoring, online ordering, invoicing, cash application and collections. By automating more of the order-to-cash process, our customers can shorten their cash cycle while we help them deliver a better experience for their buyers. Tasks can be completed faster, with less exceptions to manage, enabling better and faster customer service, and allowing teams to be deployed to higher-order tasks, increasing employee morale and productivity while improving buyer relationships. Greater visibility across the entire order-to-cash cycle gives customers a better picture of their buyers, enabling better business decisions on their behalf, and more control over the levers that help better manage cash flow. And while transforming AR from manual to digital can take effort, Billtrust’s platform lets customers do so in phases, only using the capabilities they need now while knowing other features of the platform can be implemented later.
In 2017, we launched the BPN, which is an open, two-sided network that leverages our AR platform and connects the financial services ecosystem across AP providers, payment card issuers, and banks to bring together suppliers and buyers. The BPN automates the acceptance of electronic payments and remittance data, which is seamlessly delivered to supplier accounting and ERP platforms.

We also entered into a BPN services agreement with Visa under which Visa utilizes, promotes, and markets BPN access and services to banks. The business services agreement became effective on April 4, 2019 and has a term of four years through April 4, 2023 (subject to a potential one-year extension). Under the business services agreement, Visa makes a minimum prepayment to us each year for related BPN transactions in that year, which to date has funded the amounts due from Visa to us under the services agreement. We rely on our strategic relationship with Visa to accelerate adoption of, and grow the users for, transactions processed on the BPN.
•Credit Application. Our B2B credit application module provides a modern digital process that delivers credit-related information in real-time to streamline prospect evaluation and new customer onboarding during initial sales activity. The solution provides for complete digitization and eliminates frictional challenges resulting from manual application processing, slow data validation and inconsistent review criteria, resulting in accelerated credit decisions and approvals aligning to corporate risk tolerance. The module provides a highly configurable workflow and branding capabilities.
•Credit Management. Our credit management module provides ongoing risk assessment for our customers’ customers. Our proprietary software aggregates industry trade-network inputs, bureau reports, and other third-party data to create accurate and up-to-date credit profiles. Our software also performs granular data analysis, delivering smart recommendations while our artificial intelligence (“AI”)-assisted data weighting and scoring increases accuracy. Profiles, data, and insights are made available to align day-to-day operations with corporate risk strategy.
•Order/E-commerce. Our order/e-commerce module provides B2B wholesale distributors with robust e-commerce capabilities. Our offering delivers an optimized and personalized configuration, ordering, and payment experience. Configurable and seamlessly integrated with existing ERP systems and third-party product content providers, our solution enables our customers to serve their customers 24/7 with deep B2B functionality. The web experience is augmented by an AI-powered recommendation engine and a robust native mobile application.
•Invoicing. Our invoicing module enables our customers to optimize invoice delivery across all distribution channels. Our module ingests invoice data from a myriad of ERP systems and delivers invoices in ways that reflect customer needs and preferences. The solution includes customer-branded e-presentment portals, e-bills, email billing, automated entry into AP portals via direct integration and robotic process automation, and highly efficient print and physical delivery ensuring 
rapid and cost-efficient presentment and delivery. The solution also includes support from our customer success team that leverages data from our BPN supplier business directory to help our customers migrate their customers to highly efficient electronic delivery methods.
•Integrated B2B Payments. Our deeply integrated payment capabilities enable our customers to facilitate payments at every possible touchpoint across our solution set. Various payment types, including ACH, credit card, wire, check, and cash can be accepted and automatically captured across the platform. Our configuration capabilities allow customers to drive payment acceptance on their terms with flexible criteria per individual buyer to manage costs. Examples include delinquency state, payment amount, surcharge/convenience fee inclusion, remittance quality, AP provider, and more. Our secure and compliant payment infrastructure shifts risk and compliance responsibilities away from our customers and enables them to leverage our ongoing security investment and expertise.
•Cash Application. Our cash application module enables revenue reconciliation via line item reconciliation within accounting and ERP systems. Our automated offering consumes payment and remittance data across inbound channels including lockboxes, mail, email, portal posting, hosted payment page intake, and via direct and manual feeds. The module leverages machine learning to constantly increase automation and minimize costly and manual exception handling. Our integrations with banks, AP portals, and ERPs enable rapid deployment and deliver industry-leading match rates and straight through processing. Exception handling is simplified via our intuitive user interface that is augmented by smart suggestions and an active learning process that actively eliminates exception types once handled.
•Collections. Our collections module enables customers to shift from a reactive recovery-centric model to a strategic customer touchpoint-centric operation, preventing payment delays and driving positive customer experiences. The solution delivers process efficiency and increases financial recoveries by automating workflows and providing clear visibility across relevant data points and actions taken. Policies are deployed and monitored across a collections team driving consistent focus and behaviors. Our embedded in-line payment acceptance and dispute-handling capabilities at each interaction point are often critical to recoveries.
•Business Payments Network (BPN). The BPN makes accepting electronic payments easy. The network connects suppliers and their underlying systems, AP portals, payment card issuers, banks, and payment processors in a comprehensive, supplier-driven way. Remittance and payments are automatically delivered to a supplier’s ’digital lockbox’ for processing and distribution to their accounting and ERP systems. Participating buyers and financial institutions can also facilitate payment automation with access to the BPN’s supplier business directory, a transparent listing of supplier payment preferences. The BPN allows complex financial and payment data to come together in a single platform and at scale, while providing seamless payment processing, reconciliation, and remittance management so that data and money flow more easily. Because it’s an open network, the BPN also helps companies manage both today’s payments and future payment ecosystems and provides powerful insight in working capital that customers can use to manage, control, and optimize business investment and plans for growth.
Our operations are grouped into two reportable segments: (1) Print, and (2) Software and Payments. The Print segment is primarily responsible for printing customer invoices and optimizing the amount of time and costs associated with billing customers via mail. The Software and Payments segment primarily operates using software and cloud based services, optimizes electronic invoice presentment, electronic payments, credit decisioning, collections automation, cash application and deduction management, and e-commerce of B2B customers.
Our Customers
As of December 31, 2021, over 2,400 customers use or are being onboarded to use our solutions to digitally transform their e-commerce, credit, AR, and B2B payment processes.
Our solution is flexible enough to meet the needs of mid-market and enterprise companies, including many Fortune 500 companies. In both mid-market and enterprise companies, target customers have complex order-to-cash processes as generally indicated by several factors including diverse buyers with many end points, multiple ERP systems and AP portal interactions, and high volumes of invoices and payments. Our 
platform delivers a common set of solutions to customers across both mid-market and enterprise companies with minimal differences in how the solutions are provided, serviced, or marketed to each category of customers. We currently serve companies in more than 40 industries and present invoices in approximately 190 countries. We have established significant market penetration among mid-market and enterprise companies in key verticals, including technology, healthcare, industrial, construction, and consumer-packaged goods. Our platform is highly configurable across industry verticals and interacts with more than 100 ERP systems.
Throughout our engagement with customers, we continually seek to digitally transform their AR and payment processing functions. Most customers begin with one or two modules and adopt additional modules over time, leveraging the breadth of our platform. We have a dedicated eSolutions team whose overarching focus is helping customers achieve business outcomes. Combining their efforts with those of the rest of our organization, we have achieved an annual customer revenue churn rate of 3% or less over the last three years, 100% plus net dollar retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 and an NPS score that is consistently 50 plus.
Here are two examples of our collaborative work with our customers and its results:
•Global storage and information management solutions provider: When we began working with this customer, the customer had an internal goal to convert 24,000 customers from print to digital in one year. The customer exceeded that goal in approximately one year, with 33,000 customers converted, and the customer currently sends out more than 800,000 documents per month across North America utilizing our solutions, reaching a rate for digital distribution of documents of 71% and continuing to grow.
•Global leader in performance-driven golf products: Our cash application module helped this customer achieve ACH payment match rates averaging 99.5% and enabled the company to reduce the amount of time used to perform cash application processing by an estimated 20 hours per day. These improvements helped facilitate a 20% annual increase in electronic payments.
Our Go-to-Market Strategy
We target middle-market and enterprise companies that serve a wide variety of customers and have high-frequency sales with complicated AR processing requirements. Our target market includes both mid-market and enterprise corporations across a variety of industry verticals. We are largely a direct sales organization and work in tandem with a variety of channel partners including banks, AP providers, industry associations, VARs, SIs, and ERPs.
The breadth of our platform enables us to market modules for digital transformation across the entire AR spectrum and also allows us to focus on particular customer pain points. This includes functional areas of credit, order, invoicing, payments, cash application and collection. In most cases, our new customer acquisitions are initially for one to two modules, including integrated payments. This creates a significant land-and-expand opportunity, which is a key underlying objective and value driver in our business.
We calibrate our sales and marketing activities based upon the size of the customer and whether the customer is an existing customer or a new logo opportunity.
•New Customer Acquisition. Our direct sales team consists of sales representatives that have designated portfolios of accounts. We use account-based selling and marketing. This includes persona identification such as individual influencers, gatekeepers, and decision makers. We also take a classic funnel approach to marketing against a large number of targets that drives activity to the top of our sales funnel. Our account development team quickly manages this activity to qualify leads and transition opportunities to our sales executives.
•Existing Customer Expansion. We follow a land-and-expand strategy and regularly seek to grow our business by expanding within our existing customer base. This is achieved by selling new modules into that base, penetrating additional divisions or related parties, and activating incremental electronic payment processing activity. Our teams identify the expansion opportunity within each account based on modules purchased and proclivity to purchase additional solutions based on industry and company dynamics. This enables disciplined account planning, targeting, execution, and success measurement.
•Partner Strategy. Our relationships in three sectors will continue to support our go-to-market strategy; (1) Financial institutions, including banks and card networks, (2) Technology providers, including software developers, ERPs, and FinTech firms; and (3) Industry, services and consulting organizations, including VARs, SI’s, industry associations, and consulting companies.
•Global Expansion. We have launched a global expansion strategy, starting with our acquisition of iController BV in 2021, which will give us entry into new markets in Europe and other regions to enable future growth.
Research & Development
We are committed to helping finance leaders and their organizations provide a cost-effective and differentiated customer experience for billing and payments. Through a combination of primary and secondary market research, we constantly seek to identify new solutions to build, as well as ways to improve current solutions, in order to help these leaders serve their customers better. Specific actions include product roadmap planning, quality assurance and testing of new and existing product technology and maintenance, and enhancement of our existing technology and infrastructure. Our research and development organization is comprised of engineering, data science, product and User Experience (“UX”) design teams. Our engineering teams are responsible for developing new proprietary technology, and also innovate by applying existing technologies within AR processes. Our research and development staff are constantly seeking to provide new insights from data analysis and strengthen predictive models. We believe that user interactions with our software need to be productive and enjoyable, and consequently we are highly focused on investing in UX design. We are committed to delivering impactful, highly-connected, easy-to-deploy, enterprise-grade solutions for AR with integrated payments.
Competition
All mid-market and enterprise businesses require order-to-cash processes. Order-to-cash processes are often manual and outdated, with limited automation and a large degree of paper processes. These legacy processes are our single largest competitor. Other competitors include smaller players that focus on disparate AR solutions with limited payments integration. We are unaware of any single integrated AR provider with the breadth of our capabilities and depth of payments expertise.
The market for our order-to-cash cycle products, including e-commerce order, credit application, invoice presentment, payment facilitation, and automated cash applications, is fragmented, competitive, and constantly evolving. Our competitors range from large entities to smaller suppliers of solutions that focus on billing, invoicing solutions, and/or electronic bill presentment and payment. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect that the competitive environment will remain intense going forward. Accounting software providers, as well as the financial institutions with which we partner, may internally develop products, acquire existing, third-party products, or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that would enable them to expand their product offerings to compete with our platform or provide more comprehensive offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than us. In addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships.
The category of AR automation is also emerging, following similar growth patterns as the ongoing digital transformation of AP solutions offered by companies like Coupa or SAP Ariba.
Successfully combining AR with integrated payments functionality within companies’ overall information technology footprint can help companies reduce their AR operating costs and increase speed of invoicing, cash receipt, and cash application. We believe that the key competitive factors in our market include:
•High customer satisfaction and return on investment;
•Ability to automate and digitally transform AR processes;
•Product quality, configurability, and functionality;
•Scalability of cloud-based software solutions with common UX;
•Ease of deployment and integration into both modern and legacy ERP systems;
•Extensiveness of ecosystem integrations;
•Advanced security and control;
•Brand recognition and market share;
•Regulatory compliance leadership and know-how in movement of money; and
•Flexibility to accept transactions across multiple modalities and currencies.
On the basis of these factors, we believe we are well-positioned among our competitors to help mid-market and enterprise businesses transform their AR with integrated payments. Specifically, we believe we can enable greater operational efficiency and improve customer experiences for billing and payments. We expect industry transformation will be influenced by ongoing digitization of B2B e-commerce and AP processes, government tax reforms requiring electronic invoicing, and increased demand for work-from-home solutions for AR and integrated payments.
Regulatory Environment
We operate in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. We operate through clearance and settlement systems of regulated financial institutions. The accounts that are used to move money on behalf of our customers are at banks with which we maintain contractual relationships. We enter into direct contracts with our customers, and for certain of those who provide goods or services, we act as agent of payment.
We have implemented an AML program designed to prevent our platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Our program is also designed to prevent our products from being used to facilitate business in certain countries, or with certain persons or entities, including those on designated lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and other foreign authorities. Our AML and sanctions compliance programs include policies, procedures, reporting protocols, and internal controls, including the designation of an AML compliance officer to oversee the programs, and are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in managing risk associated with money laundering and terrorist financing risks.
We collect and use a wide variety of information for various purposes in our business, including to help ensure the integrity of our services and to provide features and functionality to our customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of the information we acquire in connection with our customers’ use of our services, is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations in the United States. Accordingly, we publish our privacy policies and terms of service, which describes our practices concerning the use, transmission, and disclosure of information.
In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information which are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may be modified or subject to new or different interpretations, new laws and regulations may be enacted, or we may modify our products or services in the future, which may subject us to such laws and regulations. For example, in 2020, Europe’s top court (the Court of Justice of the European Union) ruled that the Privacy Shield, a mechanism used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the European Union and United States, was invalid and could no longer be used and also called into question the use of the standard contractual clauses.
Various regulatory agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which are applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, climate change risk management, information sharing, disclosure rules, cybersecurity, and marketing. As our business continues to develop and expand, we continue to monitor the additional rules and regulations that may become relevant.
Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required certifications or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate. For an additional discussion on governmental regulation affecting our business, refer to the risk factors related to regulation of our payments business and regulation in the areas of privacy and data use, under the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Business and Industry.”
