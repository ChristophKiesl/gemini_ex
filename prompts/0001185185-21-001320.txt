ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview



Amerityre incorporated as a Nevada corporation on January 30, 1995.



Amerityre engages in the development, manufacturing and sale of polyurethane tires. We believe that we have developed unique polyurethane formulations that allow us to make products with superior performance characteristics, such as high abrasion resistance, increased energy efficiency, and higher load-bearing capabilities, when compared to conventional rubber tires and imported flat free polyurethane tires. We also believe that our manufacturing processes are more energy efficient than the traditional rubber tire manufacturing processes, in part because our polyurethane compounds do not require the multiple processing steps, extreme heat, and high pressure that are necessary to cure rubber. Using our polyurethane-based technologies, we produce tires that last longer, are less susceptible to failure and are friendlier to the environment than conventional rubber tires.
Products



Our polyurethane material technology is based on two main proprietary formulations; closed-cell polyurethane foam, a lightweight material with high load-bearing capabilities for low duty cycle applications, and Elastothane®, a high performance polyurethane elastomer with high load-bearing capabilities for high duty applications. Closed cell foam tires and components accounted for the majority of fiscal year 2021 tire revenues. Our closed-cell polyurethane products are categorized as flat-free because they have no inner tube, do not require inflation and will not go flat even if punctured. Our tires are virtually maintenance free, non-toxic, provide extended tire life, and offer superior energy efficiency compared to rubber based tires. Our marketing efforts are divided among the following distinct segments:

● | Bicycle Tires
--+--------------


● | Light duty Industrial Vehicles (Golf Cars, Stock Chasers)
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Lawn and Garden tires
--+----------------------


● | Handtruck and small cart tires
--+-------------------------------


● | Agricultural Carts
--+-------------------


● | Forklift Tires
--+---------------


● | Mobility Tires
--+---------------




Our business model focuses our resources on applications and opportunities where our advantages in product technology and tire performance give us an opportunity to obtain premium pricing. The majority of our sales are to domestic customers as international sales are adversely affected by high freight costs.



Closed-Cell Polyurethane Foam Tires



We currently manufacture closed-cell polyurethane foam tires for bicycles, golf and baggage carts, hand trucks, lawn and garden equipment, wheelbarrows, personnel carriers, and medical mobility products, as well as custom designed applications.  Our proprietary formulations produce foam tires that enjoy a market reputation of superior quality and performance relative to competitor offerings.



Our efforts in custom product development and marketing allow us to build customer relationships and expand sales with original equipment manufacturers and tire distributors. We continue our focus on creating unique product solutions for customers with specific tire performance requirements. The demand for our golf cart, personnel carrier and baggage cart tires continues to increase as the marketplace recognizes the superior performance of our tires in industrial equipment applications. We believe this growth trend will continue going forward provided business conditions adversely affected by COVID-19 over the past year stabilize. Our growth may be delayed due to the emergence of new variants of the virus. See Item 1A – “Risk Factors” for more information. Since the inception of the pandemic in March 2020, Amerityre has operated as an “essential business”. We have seen strong demand for our products that continues to increase, resulting in strong sales revenues in Q4 of FY2021 and for the entire FY2021.

Polyurethane Elastomer Industrial Tires



We have developed solid polyurethane industrial tires made of Elastothane®, our family of proprietary polyurethane elastomer formulations.  We currently offer over 20 sizes for Class 1, 4 and 5 forklifts, as well as elastomer tires for scissor lifts. Over the past few years, we have not seen significant sales levels for our forklift tires, as the market prefers cheaper solid rubber forklift tires. Our Elasstothane® 500 material, a lighter density formulation than our standard polyurethane elastomer, continues to be well received by the agricultural applications market. This formulation has been used in baggage carts, personnel carriers, stock chasers, and lawn mowers, in applications where enhanced abrasion resistance and increased weight bearing capacity is required. We believe our polyurethane elastomer tires are superior to rubber tires as they are non-marking, more energy efficient, carry greater load weight, are made of non-toxic materials, operate in lower temperature environments and have longer comparative service life.  Our long-term success in this area is dependent upon finding new joint product development initiatives with OEM partners.



Amerityre has developed elastomer-based products for the agricultural tire market, such as flat-free pivot tires used in irrigation systems, seeder tires, and hay baler tires. Overall sales in the agricultural market have historically been negatively impacted by low commodity prices, although in recent months there has been significant increases in the price of farm commodity crops.  As with our industrial tires, we continue to pursue joint product development opportunities to increase our agricultural market base.



Raw Materials and Supplies



The two principal chemical raw materials required to develop our proprietary formulations used in the manufacture of our products are known generically as polyols and isocyanates.  We also purchase various chemical additives that are blended with the polyols and isocyanates.  We maintain multiple sources for chemical raw materials, where possible, to assure adequate supply and competitive pricing. The quality of our raw materials is critical to the superior performance of our proprietary formulations.



Over the past fiscal year, the available market supply for raw material chemicals has significantly tightened due to COVID-19 related shutdowns of refineries that produce polypropylene. In January 2021 a series of winter storms in Texas damaged the majority of propylene based chemical manufacturing, leading to all polyol users being put on allocation. This has restricted the amount of product we can produce and we have occasionally lost days of production due to raw material unavailability. These supply chain restrictions will likely continue for the next 2-3 quarters. We continue to look for other supply alternatives to enable us to produce more product.



In addition to the chemical raw materials, we purchase steel and plastic wheel components for use in tire assemblies.  We purchase these components from domestic and overseas suppliers.  The imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods as well as the meteoric rise in ocean freight costs over the past year has increased the cost to procure our imported wheel rims. Despite officials in the US government declaring these price increases “transitory” and short term, we believe that high prices will continue for raw materials and freight, and we continue to manage our business accordingly. 



Operations/Manufacturing



Our closed-cell polyurethane foam and elastomer products are primarily manufactured utilizing multiple–stationed, carousel molding machines.  We produce closed-cell foam products by pouring a proprietary polyurethane formula into a mold.  The molding process occurs by reacting monomeric diphenylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) with polyol and other chemicals.  The reaction causes a cross linking of the chemicals, which cures into a solid foam. The closed-cell polyurethane foam or elastomer product is then removed from the mold and the process is repeated.



All of our products are inspected prior to shipment to ensure quality.  Any products considered defective by our quality control personnel are disposed of through traditional refuse disposal services.  All of our tires are manufactured at our Boulder City, Nevada facility. Due to increased demand for our products over the past 3 months we have been running overtime shifts where raw material availability permits.



Information Systems



We use commercial computer aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) software tools in the engineering and design of our products.  This software allows us to integrate our proprietary manufacturing and production data with our design technology, enabling us to leverage our previous manufacturing and test results to predict the performance characteristics of new product designs and product improvements.  For general business purposes, we use commercially available software for financial, distribution, manufacturing, customer relationships and payroll management. Our computer system is protected by commercially available security and antivirus software.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution



Amerityre utilizes independent manufacturer representatives with tire industry experience to promote and sell our products. These representatives sell all of our products in a designated sales territory. These independent sales professionals complement our in-house sales department in Boulder City. The majority of our sales is direct to OEMs or sold to tire distributors who in turn sell to individual end users. We sell to individual consumers through our website, although the website is designed primarily as an education tool for current and potential customers. The majority of our product promotion is through direct mail, electronic mail, and attendance at select trade shows. All product shipments originate directly from our manufacturing facility in Boulder City, Nevada.



Internationally, we have several distribution partners located in Canada, Australia, and Europe. We continue to seek additional international sales and marketing partners to expand the worldwide sales and distribution of our products.



Customers



Amerityre has a diversified customer base, providing tires and assemblies to OEMs, distributors, equipment dealers, and individuals. Our largest OEM customer accounted for approximately 28% of our sales for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020 where this same customer accounted for approximately 27% of our sales. We expect sales with this customer to continue to increase as their business is forecast to continue to grow in fiscal year 2022. Our customers include OEMs of lawn and garden products and outdoor power equipment, regional tire distributors, retail cooperatives, agricultural tire distributors, and retailers of lawn and garden products, bicycle tires and hand truck tires. With the added exposure provided by our upgraded website, along with the ability to make purchases online, we expect market awareness among consumers to continue to increase.
Competition



There are companies that produce not-for-highway-use or light-duty tires from polyurethane foam such as Greentyre, who manufactures in the UK; Carefree Tire, who manufactures in China; Marastar (a division of Carlstar), who manufactures in China, and Custom Engineered Wheels and Krypton Industries, who manufacture in India.  We believe our closed-cell polyurethane foam tires are superior to the polyurethane foam tires offered by these competitors. Our closed cell technology gives our products higher load bearing characteristics than competitor tire products that have open-cell polyurethane foam, while producing a ride quality comparable to a properly inflated pneumatic tire. We believe we are the largest USA-based manufacturer of polyurethane flat free tires.



In addition to manufacturers of polyurethane foam tires, we compete directly with companies that manufacture and market traditional not-for-highway-use, low-duty pneumatic, semi-pneumatic, and solid tires made from rubber.  The not-for-highway use tire industry historically has been highly competitive, and most of these competitors have financial resources that substantially exceed ours. In addition, many of our competitors are very large companies, such as Kenda, Taiwan; Maxxis International, Taiwan; Cheng Shin, China; and Carlstar, USA.  These competitors have established brand name recognition, distribution networks for their products, and have some consumer loyalty to their products, although price is a major factor in the buying decision by their customers.



Despite the presence of larger competitors, we believe that the performance of our superior proprietary formulations give us some competitive advantages in certain market segments. We produce the only flat free polyurethane foam tires in the bicycle tire, golf cart tire, and personnel carrier tire market segments. The performance advantage of our formulation is evident in these market segments, where load bearing capability and ride quality is important. Consequently, we have focused our attention and sales and marketing resources on these product segments.



In the agricultural tire market, the market leaders are Titan International and Carlisle, global manufacturers of agriculture pneumatic tire and wheel assemblies.  The economic landscape in the agricultural sector appears to be improving as commodity crop prices have significantly increased over the past 6 months. While we have yet to see significant increased spending in the agricultural sector, we are optimistic that spending will increase in fiscal year 2022 if commodity pricing remains elevated. We continue to believe that the growth we have seen in the lawn and garden markets will continue in fiscal year 2022.
