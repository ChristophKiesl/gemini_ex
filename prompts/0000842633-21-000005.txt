•TriMas Business Model.  We implemented the TriMas Business Model ("TBM") in late 2016 to improve the management, performance and oversight of our businesses. The TBM is the framework that provides a platform of standards across TriMas, which allows the executive management team to communicate how we plan, budget, measure, review, incent and reward our employees. It provides the foundation for determining our priorities, executing our growth and productivity initiatives, and allocating capital and resources. Through the TMB, we set near- and long-term performance objectives and goals, including safety, financial, and talent development, measure these against defined objectives, and utilize a reliable communication and escalation process that provides for flexibility and adjustments if market expectations change. We believe the TBM enhances connectivity between our operations, and allows us to benefit from sharing best practices across each of our businesses. We believe that the TBM, through a culture of Kaizen and continuous improvement, helps drive long-term improvement in our performance. Since implementation, we have rationalized manufacturing, warehousing and office locations, streamlined fixed expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses in certain of our businesses, increased our focus on optimizing inventory levels and improved certain of our manufacturing processes. We believe actions driven by the TBM have provided a benefit to us and have augmented our cash conversion characteristics and performance overall. We will continue to rely on the TBM to drive continuous improvement and to unlock TriMas’ value potential. 
Our Growth Strategy
Guided by our experienced management team and our commitment to operational excellence, we are focused on the following components that comprise our core growth strategy: 
•Leverage the TriMas Business Model to Drive Performance.  A key tenet of the TBM is our commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement. We adopted the use of Kaizen methodology within our operations, which is predicated on engaging our employees to improve all aspects of our businesses. We believe our operating performance will continue to benefit from the use of Kaizen as a means to drive our decision-making processes. In addition to continuous improvement, the TBM is also focused on environmental, health and safety, annual goal setting and measurement, flawless launches and talent development.
•Accelerate Organic Growth through Innovation. We continue to invest in organic growth in our most compelling market segments with the highest long-term return potential. We intend to leverage our brands, expand our product offerings to current and new customers, and introduce innovative products to meet our customers' needs and help solve their challenges.

Competition 
Norris Cylinder competes against Worthington, Beijing Tianhai Industry Co., Faber and Vitkovice Cylinders, but is the only remaining steel cylinder manufacturer in the United States. In May 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous final determination that Norris Cylinder had been materially injured by imports of DOT high-pressure steel cylinders that were being subsidized by the Government of China, as well as being dumped in the U.S. market by producers in China. As a result, trade duties were imposed on the subject imports for a five-year period to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States. The duty was extended and increased for an additional five-year period in 2017, and will be subject to renewal in 2022. Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors. 
TriMas' Acquisition Strategy
TriMas views accelerating its growth through acquisitions as core to achieving its overarching corporate growth strategy. Maintaining a relentless commitment to generating exceptional cash flow, along with a strong balance sheet, allows TriMas to execute against its acquisition strategy. Our primary focus is on acquisition candidates to build out our Packaging and Aerospace platforms, as we believe the markets they serve offer the highest long-term growth and performance profiles. We typically seek "bolt-on" acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers, end markets and distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. While we would also consider opportunistic product line or bolt-on acquisitions in our Specialty Products segment, such transactions are of secondary focus.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
Our largest raw material purchases are for resins (such as polypropylene and polyethylene), steel, aluminum and other oil and metal-based purchased components. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from low-cost sources in China, India, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam.
Polypropylene and polyethylene are generally commodity resins with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. 
Historically, we have experienced volatility in costs of our raw material purchases and have worked with our suppliers to manage costs and disruptions in supply. We also utilize pricing programs to pass increased steel, resin and other raw material costs to customers. Although we may experience delays in our ability to implement price increases, we have been generally able to recover such increased costs.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,200 people, of which approximately 50% were located outside the United States. We have one facility, located in Commerce, California (USA) where our hourly employees operate under a collective bargaining agreement, and which represents approximately 14% of our U.S. employees. We have four facilities outside of the United States where our employees are affiliated with state-controlled or trade unions, which covers approximately 41% of our non-U.S. employees. 
We believe employee relations are good and are not aware of any present active union organizing activities at any of our facilities. We cannot predict the impact of any further unionization of our workplace. Our labor agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America at our TriMas Aerospace facility in Commerce, California expires in August 2021 and we expect to enter into timely negotiations regarding the extension of our agreement.

These reviews evaluate each employee’s strengths, skills and areas for opportunity, which are important for career development.
Seasonality
TriMas does not experience significant seasonal fluctuation, other than our fourth quarter, which has tended to be the lowest net sales quarter of the year given holiday shutdowns by certain of our customers and other customers deferring capital spending to the following year. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require obtaining and complying with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities. 
Current environmental laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. However, we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition to environmental laws and regulations, our operations are governed by variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Intangible Assets
Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and technology, are recorded at approximately $206.2 million at December 31, 2020, net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques.
Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology.
Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our businesses designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see discussion above by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law.
Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all three of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry.
International Operations
Approximately 22.7% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, and approximately 37.4% of our long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, in addition to our U.S. operations. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our businesses located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $70.0 million of export sales from the United States.
