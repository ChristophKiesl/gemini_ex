Item 1.  Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company and a leader in the field of neoantigen-targeted therapies, dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer by directing the immune system towards neoantigens. Genetic mutations, which are a hallmark of cancer, can result in specific immune targets called neoantigens. The presence of neoantigens in cancer cells and their absence in normal cells makes them compelling, untapped targets for cancer therapy. By directing the immune system towards these targets, we believe our neoantigen-targeted therapies will offer a new level of patient and tumor specificity in the field of cancer immunotherapy that will drive a strong risk-benefit profile to dramatically improve patient outcomes.
We aim to lead a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer patients towards an era of truly personal immuno-oncology therapies. Our founders have done pioneering work in immuno-oncology, including work that resulted in a class of immunotherapy known as checkpoint inhibitors, which aim to reactivate the immune system to kill cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated potent efficacy in cancers with higher rates of genetic mutations, or mutational burden, which provide a greater diversity of neoantigen targets. However, even in these tumor types, the majority of patients do not respond to treatment and new treatment strategies are needed. We seek to address this unmet need by leveraging the T cell modality to target neoantigens with the potential to unlock the potency of cell therapies in solid tumors.
We have deep expertise in the development of neoantigen therapies, with both T cell and vaccine modalities. We are leveraging over a decade of insights from our founders to develop neoantigen-targeted therapies that use two distinct approaches: the first approach utilizes fully personal therapies that target neoantigens specific to each individual, and the second approach utilizes therapies that target neoantigens that are shared across subsets of patients or tumor types. Both the personal neoantigen approach and the shared neoantigen approach focus on targeting a prioritized set of what we believe are the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigens. 
Our most advanced T cell program is NEO-PTC-01, our personal neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy, which consists of multiple T cell populations that are generated to target each individual patient's unique set of neoantigens. Data presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting in November 2019, as well as our ongoing research, give us confidence that we can reliably generate multiple enriched neoantigen-specific T cell populations at a therapeutic manufacturing scale that are capable of killing tumor cells. Importantly, we showed that NEO-PTC-01-induced T cell cultures directly recognize autologous patient tumor material. We believe NEO-PTC-01 has several significant advantages that could overcome the challenges of other cell therapies in the solid tumor setting. To this end, we are focusing the initial clinical development of NEO-PTC-01 in solid tumors for patients who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. In December 2019, we announced that we filed a clinical trial application, or CTA, with the Dutch Health Authority to evaluate NEO-PTC-01 in a first-in-human clinical trial. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in metastatic melanoma in collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute in the third quarter of 2020. The second planned indication for NEO-PTC-01 is metastatic ovarian cancer, with the potential to both expand to other solid tumor types and pursue clinical development in the United States.
We are also advancing a T cell therapy program targeting shared neoantigens in genetically defined patient populations to direct the immune system towards prevalent mutations that are shared across patients in specific tumor types. We intend to develop product candidates targeting shared neoantigens using both non-engineered and engineered T cell modalities. Our first product candidate using the shared neoantigen approach, NEO-STC-01, is a non-engineered adoptive T cell therapy that targets RAS mutations prevalent across many solid tumors. We are focusing our initial efforts with NEO-STC-01 on the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or PDAC, as over 84% of PDAC tumors have a RAS mutation and there is a significant unmet medical need for PDAC therapies. We have also assembled libraries of high-quality T cell receptors, or TCRs, against various shared neoantigens across common human leukocyte antigens, or HLAs, which are suitable for an engineered TCR-T cell therapy approach.
Finally, we also have two neoantigen vaccines in our portfolio, NEO-PV-01, a fully personal neoantigen cancer vaccine, custom-designed and manufactured for each individual patientâ€™s tumor mutations, and NEO-SV-01, a neoantigen vaccine for the treatment of a subset of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. NEO-PV-01 is in Phase 1b clinical development in metastatic disease settings, with three ongoing trials. In November 2019, we reported top line results from the first trial, NT-001, at the Society of Immunotherapy for Cancer 2019 meeting. In November 2019, we also announced the cessation of additional spending commitments related to our cancer vaccine programs, NEO-PV-01 and NEO-SV-01. We will continue to conduct follow-up from our ongoing NT-002 clinical trial of NEO-PV-01 in first-line patients with untreated advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, with plans to report initial clinical data from this trial in the second half of 2020. We have also ceased enrollment in our NT-003 trial in metastatic melanoma.

In developing all of our therapeutic product candidates, we leverage our proprietary neoantigen platform, which continuously improves as our product candidates generate data. This platform comprises two key elements: our Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology, or RECON, bioinformatics engine, and our combined T cell biology and immune-monitoring expertise, in particular NEO-STIM, our proprietary antigen-specific T cell induction protocol. 
Our RECON bioinformatics engine utilizes a proprietary combination of algorithms designed to predict the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigen targets associated with each patient's tumor. As detailed in our February 2017 and October 2019 papers in Immunity, our approach to bioinformatics uses a proprietary allele-specific, or mono-allelic, approach that allows us to predict neoantigens that are presented by specific Class I and Class II HLA alleles relevant for each patient. Using this approach and with our growing proteomic database of greater than 1.7 million unique HLA bound peptides, we have generated high quality datasets that have resulted in positive predictive values greater than 50%, exceeding standard approaches by greater than ten times for Class I HLAs and by greater than sixty times for Class II HLAs when using a recall-based measurement of performance. We intend to continue to strengthen our leading position in bioinformatics and identification of therapeutic neoantigens by using data generated from our ongoing and future clinical trials, coupled with our machine learning expertise, to continue to refine RECON's neoantigen prediction algorithms.
Our combined T cell biology and immune-monitoring expertise allows us to elicit neoantigen-specific immune responses, both in vivo and ex vivo, and to evaluate these responses in patients. We have developed a proprietary method for ex vivo T cell stimulation, which we call NEO-STIM, that allows us to directly prime, activate and expand antigen-specific T cells. In addition, we have built up immune profiling capabilities using a state-of-the-art toolkit that allows us to understand the antigen-specific immune responses to our therapies, thereby providing a key feedback loop that further enables improvements in research and development of our programs.
Recent Corporate Updates
On November 20, 2019, we announced that, as part of a new strategic focus, we were reducing our workforce by approximately 24% of our then current headcount. This corporate restructuring was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2019. We also announced the cessation of additional spending commitments related to our cancer vaccine programs, as detailed above.
After a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives, on January 15, 2020, we entered into an agreement with BioNTech SE, or BioNTech, pursuant to which, if all of the conditions to closing are satisfied or waived, we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioNTech, or the Merger Agreement and such transaction, the Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the members of our board of directors, or the Board, and the Board resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement to our shareholders. The closing of the Merger is subject to approval of our shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Certain of our stockholders who collectively own approximately 36% of the outstanding shares of our common stock have entered into voting agreements, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, to vote in favor of the Merger. 
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, or the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and converted (without interest but subject to any withholding required under applicable law) into the right to receive 0.063 of an American Depositary Share of BioNTech, or Parent ADS, with each Parent ADS representing one ordinary share of BioNTech. 
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.

Our Approaches and Product Candidates
The following diagram summarizes the current status of our product development pipeline:
Our Personal Neoantigen Approach
NEO-PTC-01 is a personal neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy that consists of multiple T cell populations targeting what we predict to be the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigens from each patient's tumor. T cells are a type of white blood cell that play a central role in the immune system, including both detecting and killing cancer cells. NEO-PTC-01 uses T cells from the periphery of each patient that we then specifically prime, activate and expand to generate a therapy that specifically targets that patient's personal neoantigens. We believe that NEO-PTC-01 will allow us to drive a robust and persistent anti-tumor response and could be applicable across a broad range of both hematological and solid tumors. NEO-PTC-01 is currently in preclinical development. We filed a CTA with the Dutch Health Authority in December 2019 to evaluate NEO-PTC-01 in solid tumors in patients that are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. Our first clinical trial of NEO-PTC-01 will be in metastatic melanoma and is expected to start in the third quarter of 2020.
Our Shared Neoantigen Approach
Our shared neoantigen programs take a precision medicine approach to neoantigen-targeted therapies. We are seeking to discover, validate and develop therapies directed towards shared neoantigens, which are neoantigen targets that are shared across subsets of patients or tumor types. Our proprietary shared neoantigen targets will be developed as adoptive T cell therapies. Our lead shared neoantigen product candidate is NEO-STC-01, a neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy for the treatment of cancers driven or mediated by RAS mutations. We believe NEO-STC-01 has the potential to be used across multiple different tumor types harboring RAS mutations. We also continue to make significant progress with respect to shared neoantigen discovery and validation and have assembled libraries of high-quality TCRs against various shared neoantigens across common HLAs.
Our Strategy
To fulfill our mission, we are developing neoantigen-targeted therapies that we believe have the potential to lead a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:

â€¢ | Advance product candidates using multiple T cell therapies across a broad array of patient populations.


â€¢ | Develop NEO-PTC-01 to leverage the potency of cell therapies to target neoantigens specific to each individual.


â€¢ | Develop shared neoantigen T cell therapies for patients who share specific neoantigens.


â€¢ | Strengthen our leading position in the neoantigen field through ongoing investment in our platform technologies.


â€¢ | Discover and validate a pipeline of TCRs than can effectively target tumor antigens across common HLAs and are suitable for an engineered TCR-T cell therapy approach.

Our Neoantigen Platform
We have pioneered a proprietary neoantigen platform that we are using to develop neoantigen-targeted therapies. We believe that directing the immune system towards neoantigen targets is fundamental to driving effective cancer immunotherapies. Accordingly, our platform seeks to identify and harness the most therapeutically relevant neoantigens present within each patient's tumor.
Our platform comprises two key elements that form an iterative feedback loop: our RECON bioinformatics engine, which is designed to predict the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigen targets and our combined T cell biology and immune-monitoring expertise, in particular NEO-STIM, our proprietary antigen-specific T cell induction protocol. We are using our platform to develop product candidates across several neoantigen-targeting non-engineered and engineered T cell therapies using two distinct approaches:

â€¢ | Our personal medicine approach enables neoantigen-targeted therapies that are tailored for the individual profile of each patient's tumor.


â€¢ | Our precision medicine approach enables neoantigen therapies that target prevalent neoantigens that are shared across subsets of patients or tumor types.

Overview of Our Neoantigen Platform, Treatment Approaches and Treatment Modalities
Neoantigen Selection: Our RECON Bioinformatics Engine
At the core of our neoantigen platform is our RECON bioinformatics engine, which is designed to predict the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigen targets associated with each patient's tumor. Effective prediction is critical because, although many mutations within a patient's tumor will lead to the production of a mutated protein, not all mutated proteins lead to suitable therapeutic neoantigen targets.
RECON uses a number of inputs from each patient, including DNA sequences from samples of tumor and normal tissue, RNA sequences from tumor samples, and the patient's specific MHC allele profile. RECON processes data from these inputs using a proprietary combination of algorithms in order to produce a prioritized list of neoantigen-targeting peptides that we then manufacture for use in our product candidates. These algorithms seek to:

â€¢ | Identify the mutations present within a patient's tumor;


â€¢ | Predict which mutations will lead to neoantigens that will be presented by a patient's specific MHC allele profile; and


â€¢ | Select the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigen-targeting peptides for use in our therapies based on a set of additional biological and pharmacological factors.

We believe we have built RECON as a leading neoantigen bioinformatics engine. By further leveraging the combination of leading-edge proteomics and machine learning expertise, we intend to strengthen our leadership position in identifying neoantigens. Importantly, refining predictions of therapeutic relevance of neoantigens will incorporate immunogenicity data generated from our ongoing and future clinical trials for each RECON predicted neoantigen. As a result, both proteomic and clinical data will continue to refine RECON's neoantigen prediction algorithms in an iterative manner.
RECON predictions of neoantigens, which uses somatic mutations that are accurately and robustly characterized as the starting point, recapitulates the key events in this pathway, including protein cleavage, antigen-HLA binding and T cell reactivity. Factors such as quantification of RNA expression of antigens are used in multiple steps in immunogen identification and design.

Identification of Mutations:  We believe that achieving a combination of high sensitivity and specificity is critical in identifying genetic mutations upon which to base neoantigen predictions. We use a proprietary combination of mutation detection algorithms, known as a mutation calling ensemble, to identify candidate mutations present within a patient's tumor by comparing the patient's normal DNA and tumor DNA sequences. Using this proprietary approach, we have demonstrated a consistently lower rate of false positive errors while maintaining sensitivity when compared to the use of a single mutation detection algorithm.
Prediction of Neoantigen-MHC Presentation:  We use a novel approach to predict which mutations lead to neoantigens that will bind to and be presented by MHC on the surface of a patient's cancer cells. Conventionally, neoantigen prediction is conducted using publicly available algorithms that are trained using limited datasets derived predominantly from in vitro binding assays. The utility of these assays to develop binding predictors is limited due to low throughput and does not incorporate critical insights into how peptides are processed. Later generations of algorithms use mass spectrometry techniques to isolate and sequence peptides from multiple MHC alleles. While these approaches have made advances in predicting neoantigen-MHC binding over in vitro binding assays, the utility of this multi-allelic mass spectrometry approach is limited because these algorithms are unable to discern which peptides are presented by each MHC allele. Further, requiring the use of a predictive algorithm to assign each peptide to an allele is a process that can result in a significant error rate. While these approaches have some utility, we believe, they lack adequate precision and depth across a wide enough range of alleles to have adequate clinical utility. It is our belief that superior data inputs will yield superior predictions and we have, therefore, made significant investments to generate a high-quality dataset to build the predictive abilities of our RECON bioinformatics engine.
Overview of Data Sources for Neoantigen-MHC Presentation Prediction 
As shown in the graphic above, we use a proprietary allele-specific approach that leverages our mono-allelic MHC proteomic datasets that is differentiated from earlier techniques. Overall, this approach allows us to accurately predict neoantigens that are presented by specific MHC alleles relevant for each patient. We generated our mono-allelic datasets using a novel mass spectrometry-based method for profiling MHC-bound peptides that are presented by a single Class I or Class II MHC allele. The foundation for our approach to generating mono-allelic Class I MHC ligand datasets was published in Immunity in February 2017. This work was extended by our innovative higher-throughput mono-allelic approach, which we call MAPTAC (Mono-Allelic Purification with Tagged Allele Constructs), that was published in Immunity in October 2019. In particular, MAPTAC has enabled us to rapidly extend our data for Class I MHC alleles and also generate data for many Class II MHC alleles, many of which have no publicly available data. As of March 2019, our MAPTAC dataset included 101 Class I alleles, covering greater than 95% of allelic diversity for A, B, and C alleles, and 45 Class II alleles, covering 95.0%, 78.9%, and 42.7% of allelic diversity for DR, DP and DQ, respectively. Using our MAPTAC approach, we continue to expand our dataset for Class I and Class II alleles.
Using our datasets, we have developed unique MHC allele-specific algorithms that provide far greater predictive accuracy and lower false discovery rates than standard approaches. We have used this methodology to systematically investigate Class I and II MHC alleles, enabling broad coverage of alleles across geographic populations and ethnic groups. We have already achieved greater than ninety-nine percent population coverage in the United States through our coverage of one or more Class I (HLA-A, B and C) and Class II HLA (HLA DR, DP, and DQ) alleles for each patient. We believe these enhancements will enable us to develop more effective neoantigen-targeted therapies. Using this approach and with our growing proteomic database of greater than 1.2 million unique HLA bound peptides, we have generated high quality datasets that have resulted in positive predictive 
5

values greater than 50%. The performance of RECON to predict antigen-HLA binding exceeds that of standard approaches, such as netMHCPan, by up to greater than ten times for Class I HLAs and by up to greater than sixty times for Class II HLAs when using a recall-based measurement of performance. Our next-generation algorithms using mono-allelic data for Class I MHC alleles have now been deployed in our ongoing clinical trials and we plan to deploy our Class II MHC prediction capabilities in upcoming trials. 
The figure below provides an overview of the neoantigen presentation pathway on the left and how RECON models this biology on the right. 
Overview of Neon's RECON Bioinformatics Engine 
In addition to mono-allelic mass spectrometry-based HLA-antigen presentation predictions, RECON predictions of neoantigens recapitulates other key events in this pathway. For example, we have also developed a proprietary algorithm designed to predict how proteins are processed into peptides and how this process influences which peptides can be presented by MHC. Factors such as quantification of RNA expression and truncality scores (which is a measure of the percent of cells that harbor the mutation) of antigens are used in multiple steps in immunogen identification and design. In addition, we have also observed that intra-tumoral MHC Class II presentation is dominated by professional antigen presenting cells, or APCs, rather than tumor cells. Therefore, tracking which tumor epitopes are most readily phagocytosed (or ingested by a cell) and presented by APCs further enhances the ability to pinpoint therapeutically relevant epitopes. These findings can be used to further enhance RECONâ€™s predictive power.
Selection of the Most Therapeutically-Relevant Neoantigens:  In our effort to select the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigens, in addition to the factors described above, we incorporate a number of additional filters and algorithms applied to RECON-identified neoantigens that account for several biological and pharmacological factors, as well as manufacturing considerations. These include prioritizing based on predictions of T cell reactivity. Also, features of each mutation, such as truncality, help identify the most preferred immunogenic HLA bound antigens to target.
Our current version of RECON is trained using our mono-allelic mass spectrometry data for Class I MHC epitopes and is used in our ongoing clinical trials for NEO-PV-01. We plan to incorporate Class II MHC epitope prediction into the version of RECON used for future clinical trials, including for our planned clinical trial of NEO-PTC-01. Through intensive immune monitoring of epitope immunogenicity in our clinical studies, we can improve the quality of RECON's predictions over time by understanding the immune response to each epitope. 
Neoantigen Immunogenicity: Inducing T cells with NEO-STIM and Evaluating Antigen-specific T Cell Responses
Fundamental to our platform is our ability to elicit neoantigen-specific immune responses, both in vivo and ex vivo, and to evaluate these responses in patients. It is therefore vital for us to understand how T cell responses can be induced and expanded to target neoantigens and to monitor the immune system response in treated patients.
We have developed a proprietary method for ex vivo T cell stimulation, which we call NEO-STIM, that allows us to directly prime, activate and expand antigen-specific T cells.

Overview of NEO-STIM Induction Protocol
NEO-STIM has several important advantages compared to other tumor-targeting T cell induction and expansion protocols including:

â€¢ | Starting with peripherally collected apheresis material and does not require harvesting tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs;


â€¢ | No cell engineering required to generate potent antigen-specific T cells;


â€¢ | Ability to both induce de novo and expand memory antigen-specific immune responses in the laboratory; and


â€¢ | Generating T cells with desired phenotype that can kill antigen expressing tumor targets and autologous tumor without use of IL-2, which is a potent cytokine signaling molecule for the immune system, during the T cell culture process.

Given these advantages of NEO-STIM, we apply this important platform technology both for research purposes and as a key inline manufacturing step to generate neoantigen-specific adoptive T cell therapies. Applications for NEO-STIM include:

â€¢ | Inline manufacturing for neoantigen-specific adoptive T cell therapies: We can generate therapeutic-scale T cell populations under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions that are specific to a patientâ€™s neoantigen targets. NEO-STIM can be used in this way for programs targeting personal neoantigens specific to a patientâ€™s tumor, as in the case for NEO-PTC-01, or shared neoantigens such as RAS, as in the case for NEO-STC-01. 


â€¢ | Validating the immunogenicity of neoantigen targets: NEO-STIMâ€™s ability to induce de novo neoantigen-specific T cell responses allows us to confirm the immunological relevance of specific predicted neoantigens and is an important validation step for our shared neoantigen pipeline. 


â€¢ | Isolating neoantigen-specific T cell receptors: We generate tumor antigen-specific T cells and isolate TCRs specific to each tumor antigen that have the potential to be used in developing multiple TCR-based T cell therapies. 


â€¢ | Learning the rules for which epitopes are immunogenic: By testing many epitopes and T cell responses, we can learn the rules of immunogenicity that indicate which epitopes may successfully lead to immune responses. This information can then be used to improve RECONâ€™s prediction algorithms. 

We have also developed extensive in-house immune-monitoring capabilities that allow us to interrogate the immune state of a patient before, during and after each therapeutic intervention. We evaluate multiple components of the immune system, including different types of immune cells and important classes of cytokines, in both the periphery and the tumor. To evaluate immune responses, we use a range of cutting-edge techniques, including rapid UV-exchange MHC multimers developed by one of our founders, Ton Schumacher, which allow us to analyze neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells, TCR sequencing to determine the distribution of neoantigen-specific T cells, single cell sequencing and multi-channel flow cytometry. We complement the use of these monitoring techniques with the use of other more common immune-monitoring techniques such as ELISpot assays and immunohistochemistry. Together, these techniques allow us to generate comprehensive immunological data from our clinical trials and to correlate them with our analysis of the tumor both before and after treatment. We expect to use these data to make ongoing improvements to RECON's neoantigen selection and prioritization algorithms, identify biomarkers that can help predict which patients will be responsive to therapy, further enhance clinical development strategies and inform generational improvements to our product candidate portfolio.

Our Approaches and Product Candidates
Personal Neoantigen Approach
For our personal medicine approach to neoantigen-targeted therapy, we are developing therapies that are tailored to each patient's specific set of tumor neoantigens. We are currently developing a personal neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy called NEO-PTC-01. We believe our personal approach has potential to be an effective new treatment across solid tumors that are unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Personal Neoantigen Adoptive T Cell Therapy Program: NEO-PTC-01
Overview
NEO-PTC-01, is a personal neoantigen T cell therapy consisting of multiple T cell populations targeting what we believe to be the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigens from each patient's tumor. NEO-PTC-01 is currently in preclinical development. In December 2019, we filed a CTA with the Dutch Health Authority to evaluate NEO-PTC-01 in the solid tumor setting in patients that are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors in collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute in the third quarter of 2020. The second planned indication for NEO-PTC-01 is metastatic ovarian cancer, with the potential to both expand to other solid tumor types and pursue clinical development in the United States.
NEO-PTC-01 leverages our neoantigen platform, including RECON and NEO-STIM. Using RECON, we select high ranking neoantigens personalized to each patient. This set of neoantigen-targeting peptides is then manufactured for each patient on an individual basis. We next leverage these custom-manufactured peptides in our proprietary ex vivo co-culture process, NEO-STIM, to prime, activate and expand autologous neoantigen-specific T cells specific for each patient's personal set of neoantigens. We believe that this approach will allow us to specifically target each patient's individual tumor with T cells that can drive a robust and persistent anti-tumor response. The graphic below outlines the process that we will employ for NEO-PTC-01:
NEO-PTC-01 Product Process
Product Development Rationale
We believe that NEO-PTC-01 has the potential to unlock the potency of cell-based therapies in solid tumors. This stands in contrast to approved T cell therapies that have been limited to hematological cancers to date.
Adoptive T cell therapies, particularly chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-Ts, have demonstrated potent efficacy in the treatment of certain hematological cancers. These therapies use genetically-engineered constructs inserted into T cells that allows for the recognition and killing of cancer cells expressing certain cell surface targets, such as the B-lymphocyte antigens CD19 and BCMA. However, CAR-T approaches are currently restricted to single targets and treatment with CAR-T therapies has been observed to come with a significant toxicity profile. 
Steven Rosenberg and his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute have demonstrated the potential of neoantigen-specific T cell therapies in the case studies of two patients enrolled in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial that characterized tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. A case study published in Science in May 2014 discusses the results of treatment of one female patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with expanded autologous tumor T cells specific towards a mutation in the gene Erbb2IP. In this case, a cell therapy was prepared containing a 95% pure population of CD4+ T cells targeting this specific Erbb2IP mutation. Treatment with this therapy was associated with tumor regression two months later, with a maximum tumor size reduction of 30% observed at seven months post-treatment and disease stabilization for 13 months. A case study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December 2016 discusses the results of treatment of one female patient with colorectal cancer with CD8+ T cells targeting the G12D point mutation in the KRAS oncogene. Treatment with this T cell population was associated with tumor 
8

regression 40 days later and disease control for nine months. In the case of this patient, the T cell therapy had no reported adverse effects and the patient was discharged from the hospital two weeks following therapy.
We believe that NEO-PTC-01â€™s T cell therapy approach has several key advantages that overcome the challenges of other cell therapy approaches, including:

â€¢ | T cell induction and amplification outside of the body: Using NEO-STIM, we can directly prime, activate and expand neoantigen-targeting T cells ex vivo. We believe that by performing these processes outside the body, we can avoid potential immunosuppression or inhibitory mechanisms in patients and optimize the phenotype and functionality of the neoantigen-targeting T cells. 


â€¢ | Generating multiple memory and de novo neoantigen responses: We aim to both expand existing memory T cell responses and prime de novo T cell responses from the naÃ¯ve compartment that have not previously been observed in the patient. By expanding memory responses, we aim to increase the magnitude of pre-existing immune responses against neoantigens. By priming de novo responses, we believe we can educate the immune system to recognize a broader set of neoantigen targets, thereby strengthening the immune response. 


â€¢ | Broad utility across tumor types, including solid tumors: Neoantigens are present across both solid and hematological tumor types. As a result, we believe that neoantigen targets will provide the tumor specificity required to develop safe, effective and durable T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors. 


â€¢ | Potential impact in tumors with lower mutational burden: In tumors with lower mutational burden where checkpoint inhibitors are less likely to be efficacious, we believe it may be possible to treat these patients through expanded populations of functional T cells specific for the most therapeutically-relevant neoantigens. 

Preclinical Development
We are developing NEO-PTC-01 in collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute, which is an academic research and treatment center with leading expertise in T cell biology and treatments. We presented preclinical data relating to NEO-PTC-01 at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer 2019 meeting, highlighting the proof of feasibility of our NEO-STIM induction protocol. Through these data, we demonstrated, reproducibly across multiple patient samples, the ability to generate multiple CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations in each patient sample from the memory and naÃ¯ve compartment. These T cells were highly functional and were specific for mutant neoantigens. In addition, these data showed that these cells were capable of in vitro cell killing and NEO-PTC-01-induced T cell cultures directly recognize autologous tumor sample material. We can now reproducibly generate these cell populations from patient material at a therapeutic manufacturing scale.
Our NEO-STIM induction protocol generates a polyclonal population of T cells. Once generated, we deeply characterize this cell product to understand the specificity and functionality of the induced cells. Data analyzed from a melanoma patient shows that NEO-STIM can induce CD8+ T cell responses towards patient-specific neoantigens in autologous patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs. Specifically, in this patient, as the charts below and to the left illustrate, a pre-existing memory response was expanded 16-fold, from 4.5% of CD8+ T cells to 72.1% of CD8+ T cells being specific for the selected neoantigen. Additionally, as the charts below and to the right illustrate, we induced two CD8+ T cell responses from the naÃ¯ve compartment, generating 6.5% and 13.4% of CD8+ T cells, respectively. Finally, in this patient, we induced three neoantigen specific CD4+ T cell responses as well. 
9

Since the infusion of polyfunctional T cells has been associated with better efficacy in vivo and long-term persistence (Appay et al., Nature Medicine, 2008), we characterized the induced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in more detail for their functionality. As demonstrated in the charts below, upon re-challenge with mutant peptide loaded dendritic cells, neoantigen-specific T cells exhibited one, two and/or three of the following functions: IFNÎ³, TNFÎ± or CD107a. 
Finally, we set out to study the ability of the induced CD8+ T cells to kill tumor targets that process and present the neoantigen of interest. A375 tumor cell lines were stably transduced with the HLA restriction element, as well as the neoantigen of interest. Subsequently, and as demonstrated in the charts below, we performed a 6-hour co-culture with the induced T cells. We determined that the neoantigen specific CD8+ T cells upregulated CD107a and the tumor targets expressed active caspase 3 (an early apoptotic marker) upon co-culture. 
10

Additionally, we found that NEO-PTC-01-induced T cells can directly recognize autologous tumors as shown in the figure below.
Induced CD8+ T cells Recognize Autologous Tumors as Reflected by Induction of IFNy and/or CD107a+ 
In summary, our development activities confirm that the patient-specific neoantigens that were predicted through our RECON bioinformatics engine are immunogenic based on the induction of multiple neoantigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses. Further, the presence at the end of the NEO-STIM process of multiple enriched neoantigen-specific T cell populations (both memory and de novo) demonstrates our potential to generate new T cell responses and, as a result, cancer immunotherapies that may be effective to treat cancer patients.
Clinical Development Plan 
We are focusing the initial clinical development of NEO-PTC-01 in solid tumors where we believe we can generate de novo neoantigen T cell populations ex vivo. We filed a CTA with the Dutch Health Authority in December 2019 to evaluate NEO-PTC-01 in a first-in-human clinical trial in patients that are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma who are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors in collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute in the third quarter of 2020. The primary objectives of this trial will be to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering NEO-PTC-01 to patients. Additional objectives will be to evaluate immunogenicity and clinical efficacy. The second planned indication for NEO-PTC-01 is metastatic ovarian cancer.
Based on the data from the first exploratory trial, we will decide how to best proceed with further clinical development of NEO-PTC-01, including expanding to other tumor types and potential development in the United States.
Shared Neoantigen Approach
Overview
Our precision medicine approach to neoantigen-targeted therapy targets neoantigens shared across subsets of patients. While most neoantigen targets are specific to an individual patient's tumor, there are prevalent neoantigens that are shared across subsets of patients or tumor types, and these are known as shared neoantigens. We intend to develop multiple therapies directed towards these shared neoantigen targets using T cell therapies. We believe that our shared neoantigen approach could be complementary to our personal neoantigen therapies by providing readily available therapies that can be used in patients identified as having the relevant shared genetic mutation.
11

Shared Neoantigen Approach
Our shared neoantigen targets were identified using our bioinformatics capabilities, including RECON, to interrogate large genomic databases to discover a set of proprietary shared neoantigen targets across certain patient populations within major tumor types. This discovery work began under the direction of our founder, Nir Hacohen, at the Broad Institute, Inc., or the Broad, and continues today at Neon.
We are currently completing a comprehensive validation of our prevalent shared neoantigen targets using the following assessments:

â€¢ | Biochemical measurements leveraging mass spectrometry approaches enable us to rapidly evaluate whether shared mutations are processed and presented on common HLAs as targetable shared neoantigens. These approaches allow us to de-risk targets early in the validation process.


â€¢ | Immunological experiments evaluate whether our shared neoantigen targets are immunogenic. We use our proprietary NEO-STIM induction process to generate neoantigen-specific T cells from which we can also isolate and sequence neoantigen-specific TCRs specific to these shared neoantigens.


â€¢ | Functional biological assays demonstrate the ability of these neoantigen-specific T cells or neoantigen-specific TCRs to recognize and kill cancer cells expressing the relevant shared neoantigens.

We have completed the validation of our first targets and plan to develop multiple adoptive T cell product candidates targeting different shared neoantigens. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with respect to TCR discovery and have assembled libraries of high-quality TCRs against various shared neoantigens across common HLAs. We plan to explore the potential development of our neoantigen-specific TCRs into multiple TCR-based T cell therapies, potentially in collaboration with external partners who would provide complementary technical capabilities.
NEO-STC-01: Adoptive T cell Therapy for RAS-mediated Cancers
NEO-STC-01 is a shared neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy that targets RAS mutations prevalent across many solid tumors. It is an autologous, non-engineered T cell product that leverages a premanufactured "target warehouse" for RAS driver mutations, to generate multiple CD8+ and CD4+ target-specific T cell populations for potent anti-tumor effect. 
12

NEO-STC-01 Product Process
NEO-STC-01 uses a precision approach to treat a genetically defined patient population with poor prognosis, for whom there are currently no effective therapies. NEO-STC-01 will be able to address multiple HLA alleles, greatly increasing the addressable patient population. In contrast, engineered TCR T cell therapies are limited to a single HLA allele per TCR, therefore requiring multiple products to address RAS mutations in the general population. For example, based on RECON predictions, NEO-STC-01 can potentially address up to two thirds of all RAS-mutant PDAC patients versus <10% of patients when using a TCR-T cell therapy for a single HLA allele. 
Our NEO-STIM technology is also used here as an inline manufacturing step, similar to NEO-PTC-01. NEO-STIM uses PBMCs as a starting material which are more accessible than TILs, which are used by other adoptive T cell therapies. Further, use of PBMCs as a starting material has been shown to produce an optimal T cell phenotype with the potential to drive persistence and tumor cell killing. NEO-STIM also generates T cell populations from both the memory and naÃ¯ve T cell compartments, broadening the patientâ€™s anti-tumor immune repertoire against the target RAS neoantigens. Additionally, since NEO-STC-01 targets known, common RAS neoantigens, we can pre-manufacture the peptides that feed into the manufacturing process for NEO-STC-01, which in turn helps to shorten the overall manufacturing time and allows patients to receive their treatments quicker. 
NEO-STC-01 is currently in preclinical development and we have generated data that support mechanism of action and provide a strong rationale for further development. RAS mutant neo-epitopes in our RAS target warehouse have been extensively validated and T cell populations against them can be reproducibly induced in healthy donors. The induced T cells are cytotoxic and can kill patient-derived tumor cells at endogenous antigen levels. Process optimization will be ongoing in 2020 and learnings from NEO-PTC-01, Neonâ€™s personal T cell therapy, are expected to help accelerate preclinical development of NEO-STC-01.
Manufacturing
We have invested in manufacturing capabilities to supply cGMP product for our clinical programs. Currently, we outsource our manufacturing to third parties. We own and control proprietary methods and intellectual property regarding peptide and cell manufacturing. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products. We will be focusing on more efficient and scalable manufacturing, which we believe will lead to a commercially attractive cost of goods when operating at commercial scale.
We receive material from our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for preclinical testing. We receive clinical supply material manufactured in compliance with cGMP, and we conduct audits before and during the trial, in cooperation with a CMO, to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations.
Our use of single-source suppliers of raw materials, components, key processes and finished goods exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases or late deliveries. As a result, we continually evaluate our supplier relationships.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immunotherapy subsector in particular, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
13

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. In addition to fully-integrated biopharmaceutical companies and immunotherapy-focused oncology companies, we directly compete with a number of neoantigen T cell companies, including Achilles Therapeutics Limited, Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Adicet Bio, Inc., AgenTus Therapeutics, Inc., BioNTech SE, bluebird bio, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Genocea Biosciences, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gritstone Oncology, Inc., Immatics Biotechnologies GmbH, IMV Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., Lion TCR Pte. Ltd., Marker Therapeutics, Inc., Medigene AG, Neogene Therapeutics, Inc., Nouscom AG, PACT Pharma, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Zelluna Immunotherapy AS and ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. Smaller or early-stage companies, including immunotherapy-focused and neoantigen-focused therapeutics companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use, including formulations and combination therapies.
As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use and biomarkers and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. As of December 31, 2019, our patent portfolio included at least two issued U.S. patents with claims directed to methods of preparing therapeutic compositions and methods of treating cancer, at least 41 pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, at least 19 foreign patents with claims directed to methods of preparing therapeutic compositions and compositions of matter, and at least 159 pending foreign patent applications, which patents and patent applications we owned or exclusively licensed. The claims of these owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications are directed toward various aspects of our product candidates and research programs, including claims related to compositions of matter, methods of use, drug product formulations, combination therapies, methods of manufacture, manufacturing precursors and methods of identifying active compounds. These owned patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2040, and these in-licensed patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2031 through 2039, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions.
Within our patent portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, we had an exclusive license from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or DFCI, the Broad, and The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, pursuant to our amended license agreement with the Broad, or the Broad Agreement, to at least two issued U.S. patents, at least seven pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, at least 13 foreign patents, and at least 77 pending foreign patent applications that include claims directed to NEO-PV-01, such as compositions of matter, combination therapies, formulations, manufacturing processes, manufacturing precursors or uses thereof. These in-licensed patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2031 through 2037, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions.
Within our patent portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, we had exclusive licenses pursuant to the Broad Agreement and others to at least four pending U.S. provisional or U.S. non-provisional patent applications, at least 10 foreign patents, and at least five 
14

pending foreign patent applications that include claims directed to NEO-PTC-01, such as compositions of matter, formulations, manufacturing processes, manufacturing precursors or uses thereof. These in-licensed patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2031 through 2040, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions.
Within our patent portfolio, as of December 31, 2019, we owned at least 10 pending U.S. provisional or U.S. non-provisional patent applications and at least 42 pending foreign patent applications, and had an exclusive license pursuant to the Broad Agreement, to at least one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and at least 29 pending foreign patent applications that include claims directed to NEON / SELECT (including our NEO-SV-01 product candidate), such as compositions of matter, formulations, manufacturing processes, manufacturing precursors or uses thereof. These owned patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2039, and these in-licensed patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2036, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions.
We also have agreements with Stichting Sanquin Bloedvoorziening, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Oncovir and other third parties under which we have rights to certain intellectual property, such as patents or patent applications.
We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties now or in the future, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether these extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of these extensions.
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, significant elements of our products, including aspects of sample preparation, methods of manufacturing, cell culturing conditions, computational-biological algorithms and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived of by the individual that are related to our current or planned business or research and development or are made during normal working hours on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations and our advice for best practices in protecting our trade secrets.
License Agreement with the Broad Institute, Inc.
On November 13, 2015, we entered into the Broad Agreement with the Broad and, in January and November 2018, we entered into amendments to the Broad Agreement. Under the Broad Agreement, we have been granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by the Broad, DFCI and MGH to develop and commercialize any diagnostic, prognostic, preventative or therapeutic product for humans, including any neoantigen vaccine product. In particular, as of December 31, 2019, we have both exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a patent portfolio comprised of 10 patent families, including certain granted patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.
15

Pursuant to the terms of the Broad Agreement, we have also been granted (i) a non-exclusive license under each institution's respective interest in certain of its patent rights to exploit the licensed products in the field in the territory during the term of the license and (ii) a non-exclusive license under each institution's licensed know-how, to exploit any diagnostic, prognostic, preventative or therapeutic product in the field in the territory during the term of the license. We are also entitled to sublicense the rights granted to us under the Broad Agreement. In connection with the Broad Agreement, we have also entered into a non-exclusive software license with the Broad under which we license certain object and source codes for several software programs.
These licenses and rights are subject to certain limitations and retained rights, including field restrictions.
As consideration for the license, we paid the Broad a non-refundable license fee of $75,000. As additional consideration for the license, we must pay the Broad immaterial annual license maintenance fees and up to $12.6 million in developmental milestone payments and could be obligated to make up to $97.5 million in payments upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to mid single-digit percentages on net sales of products covered by the license, as well as between 10% to 30% of any consideration received by us from a sublicensee in consideration for a sublicense, which percentage is based on certain events set forth in the Broad Agreement. As partial consideration for the license, we reimbursed the Broad for $0.6 million of past patent expenses and issued 60,000 shares of our restricted common stock to each of the Broad, DFCI and MGH. We also agreed to reimburse the Broad for future patent expenses related to the in-licensed patents and patent applications. No development or commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the Broad Agreement. The royalty term will terminate on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights and (ii) the 10th anniversary date of the first commercial sale of a product incorporating the licensed patent rights.
Either we, or the institutions party thereto, may terminate the Broad Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure that breach within 105 days (or 45 days in the case of our failure to make any payment or in the case of our breach of our diligence obligations) after written notice is provided, or, in the case of the Broad, upon our bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up, or upon us bringing patent challenges relating to any patent families. In addition, we may terminate the Broad Agreement for convenience as it relates to certain patent families upon up to 120 days' prior written notice to the Broad. Upon expiration of the Broad Agreement, we will have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license to the intellectual property previously covered by the Broad Agreement.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through a Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:

â€¢ | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;


â€¢ | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


â€¢ | Approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;

16


â€¢ | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


â€¢ | Submission to the FDA of a BLA;


â€¢ | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;


â€¢ | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic's identity, strength, quality and purity;


â€¢ | Potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


â€¢ | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States.

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, which may overlap.

â€¢ | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.


â€¢ | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. During Phase 2 clinical trials, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.

17


â€¢ | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency for the biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product's use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a 
18

recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers those recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if an applicant submits the requested data and information, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant does.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drugâ€™s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the BLA and the applicant pays the applicable user fee. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably 
19

likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require those post-marketing restrictions that it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as "off-label use") and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote off-label uses. Prescription biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS and the FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a productâ€™s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS, or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. 
20

Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.

â€¢ | The Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.


â€¢ | The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.


â€¢ | The federal anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiaryâ€™s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program.


â€¢ | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.


â€¢ | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

21


â€¢ | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.


â€¢ | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures.

State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company's attention from its business.
Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, address a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increase the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establish annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and create a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 
22

effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturerâ€™s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.
Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:

â€¢ | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2029, unless additional Congressional action is taken.


â€¢ | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.


â€¢ | The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that CMS reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by 2% in 2013, which served as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, effective January 1, 2014, CMS also began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting.

Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. For example, the United States government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Further, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration recently released a "Blueprint", or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The current administrations' Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, is already working to implement. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMSâ€™s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, and would require the HHS to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019. However, it is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Individual states in the United States have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, 
23

discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Packaging and Distribution in the United States
If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
24

An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. "First licensure" typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial.
European Union Drug Development
In the European Union, or EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical.
European Union Drug Marketing
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
25

European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU (and Norway), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

â€¢ | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that are in the interest of public health in the EU.


â€¢ | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).

Under these procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and, as of May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, including in respect of clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations
If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from offering, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing payment of money or anything of value, to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are owned and operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials for the purposes of the statute. Certain payments made in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to complying with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products, if approved, will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurers and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such that those third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products in which our products are used. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor's determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors 
27

will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process may be a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new method by which rebates owed by are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. The 340B program imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. It is unclear how this decision could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our products in the future, and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member 
28

States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and, generally, prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.
