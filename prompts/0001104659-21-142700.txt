--------+---------

At Twist Bioscience Corporation, we work in service of customers who are changing the world for the better. In fields such as health care, food/agriculture, industrial chemicals/materials, academic research and data storage, by using our synthetic DNA tools, our customers are developing ways to better lives and improve the sustainability of the planet. We believe that the faster our customers succeed, the better for all of us, and we believe Twist Bioscience is uniquely positioned to help accelerate their efforts.
We have developed a disruptive DNA synthesis platform to industrialize the engineering of biology that provides DNA for a wide range of uses and markets. The core of our platform is a proprietary technology that pioneers a new method of manufacturing synthetic DNA by “writing” DNA on a silicon chip. We have miniaturized traditional chemical DNA synthesis reactions to write over one million short pieces of DNA on each silicon chip, approximately the size of a large mobile phone. We have combined our silicon-based DNA writing technology with proprietary software, scalable commercial infrastructure and an e-commerce platform to create an integrated technology platform that enables us to achieve high levels of quality, precision, automation, and manufacturing throughput at a significantly lower cost than our competitors.
We have applied our unique technology to manufacture a broad range of synthetic DNA-based products, including synthetic genes, tools for next generation sequencing (NGS) sample preparation, and antibody libraries for drug discovery and development, all designed to enable our customers to conduct research more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, we are expanding our footprint by harnessing our proprietary platform to disrupt and innovate within larger market opportunities, such as discovery partnerships for biologic drugs, and completely new applications for synthetic DNA, such as digital data storage, to expand the overall reach and impact of DNA-based products. We sell our synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products to a global customer base of approximately 2,900 customers across a broad range of industries.
DNA is the fundamental building block of biology. The ability to design DNA and engineer biology, a field known as synthetic biology, is growing rapidly, and we believe this field represents one of the most exciting areas of growth and technological innovation in the 21st century. The ability to modify DNA to improve health and the sustainability of the planet is leading to a broad range of applications for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products across multiple industries, including:

● | healthcare for the identification, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease (antibody discovery and optimization technology);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | chemicals/materials for cost-effective and sustainable production of new and existing specialty chemicals and materials, such as spider silk, nylon, rubber, fragrances, food flavors and food additives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | food/agriculture for more effective and sustainable crop production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | academic research for a broad range of education and discovery applications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | technology for potential use as an alternative long-term data storage medium.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
We currently generate revenue through our synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing, or NGS, tools product lines. In addition, we are leveraging our platform to expand our portfolio to include other synthetic DNA-based products and address additional market opportunities, including vertical market opportunities in biological drug discovery and development and digital data storage.
As part of our synthetic biology continuum offering, we have commercialized a custom DNA library solution which we believe can be leveraged to facilitate other proprietary tools to provide an end-to-end solution in biologics drug discovery and early development, from target to investigational new drug, or IND, application, adding value as a partner to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We are also leveraging this capability for our internal antibody discovery efforts.
In fiscal year 2021 we served approximately 2,900 customers and reported $132.3 million in revenue, including $34.5 million in revenue to the chemicals/materials sector, $71.2 million in revenue to the healthcare sector, $25.3 million in revenue to the academic research sector and $1.3 million in revenue to the food/agriculture sector.

COVID-19 considerations
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, our revenues were not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We did introduce important tools to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, although revenue from that product line has not been material. Similarly, to date we have not experienced a decline in revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our future financial results and operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the recurrence, severity and/or duration of the ongoing pandemic, and current or future domestic and international actions to contain and treat COVID-19.
We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and we have taken and continue to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include increasing our inventory, requiring remote working arrangements for employees not integral in physically making and shipping our products or who need specialized equipment to perform their work, investing in personal protective equipment, and providing paid sick leave to affected employees. On July 20, 2020 we commenced weekly testing of our employees working on site and we require all U.S. employees have been vaccinated as of October 25, 2021.
Due to the speed with which the situation may change, we are not able at this time to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on our financial results and operations, but the effect could be material for fiscal year 2022 and/or during any future period affected either directly or indirectly by this pandemic. For further discussion of the risks relating to COVID-19, see “We are subject to risks associated with COVID-19” under the section titled “Risk factors.”
Our Markets
Synthetic Biology
Our products serve life sciences researchers including those working in the field of synthetic biology, which is undergoing an era of rapid innovation and transformation. Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology to build new biological systems or re-design existing biological systems. The ability to design DNA and engineer biology is creating advances and benefits for a broad and growing range of applications for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products across multiple industries, including

● | healthcare for the discovery and production of new vaccines, therapeutics and molecular diagnostics;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | chemicals/materials for cost-effective and sustainable production of new and existing specialty chemicals and materials, such as spider silk, nylon, rubber, fragrances food flavors and food additives;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | food/agriculture for more effective and sustainable crop production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | academic research for a broad range of applications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | technology for potential use as an alternative long-term data storage medium.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetic DNA is the fundamental building block of synthetic biology. Researchers at a wide range of institutions can design synthetic DNA to regulate the production of proteins and other molecules to achieve a specific functional purpose. While synthetic DNA has been produced for more than 40 years, the complexities of biology and the production constraints inherent in legacy processes have historically limited the applications and market opportunities for DNA synthesis.
Next-Generation Sequencing
Our NGS tools play an integral role in the way our customers prepare their patient samples to be sequenced. NGS has transformed many markets in recent years by changing the landscape of diagnosing disease and disorders and offers a path to prevent or treat disease. Some of the markets impacted by NGS include oncology, reproductive health, food/agriculture, consumer genomics, infectious disease research and drug discovery. As NGS technology improves and the cost of sequencing declines, new emerging markets that were once considered impractical, such as population-scale sequencing, liquid biopsy (a test that detects multiple types of cancer from a single blood sample), minimal residual disease testing and single cell sequencing, have become major areas of interest and investment.

Historically, a significant constraint in many NGS applications has been the high cost and long turnaround time of oligonucleotide production. Highly accurate and reproducible oligonucleotide production is required to produce high quality target enrichment data. Traditionally, the lack of options for oligonucleotide production forced researchers to choose between using less precise methods or to reduce the number of samples in their study.
The ability of the Twist DNA synthesis platform to precisely manufacture target enrichment probes at large scale has dramatically increased the types of projects that can now be addressed using NGS technologies. Our platform has unlocked new applications, improved data quality, and dramatically expanded the types of scientific questions that can be answered using NGS. In addition, the speed of our DNA synthesis platform enables customers to quickly deploy NGS technologies to applications where the time to answer is critical.
Our platform
We developed the Twist Bioscience DNA synthesis platform to address the limitations of throughput, scalability, and cost inherent in legacy DNA synthesis methods. Our platform stems from extensive analyses and improvements to the existing gene synthesis and assembly workflows. Our core technologies combine expertise in silicon, software, fluidics, chemistry, and motion and vision control to miniaturize thousands of parallel chemical reactions on silicon and write thousands of strands of DNA in parallel. With a footprint that is similar to the size of a 96-well plate that historically can only produce one gene, we are able to produce 9,600 genes in parallel. Based on current production needs, we have intentionally designed our latest chip to make 6,144 genes in parallel, but we have the current capability to increase this to 9,600 genes, as needed. We have combined our DNA synthesis technology with propriety software and a scalable commercial infrastructure to create our vertically integrated DNA synthesis platform capable of delivering very large volumes of high-quality synthetic DNA at low cost.
Enzymatic Synthesis
Several companies are pursuing an emerging gene synthesis process that uses enzymatic chemistry rather than phosphoramidite chemistry. While the promise of enzymatic synthesis to deliver longer genes in a shorter timeframe provides excitement for the industry, this technology is at the proof-of-concept stage and has not yet been proven to be scalable or commercially viable. If, in the future, enzymatic synthesis proves commercially scalable, we have the ability to include this chemistry within our established commercial infrastructure.
Our products
We have developed multiple products derived from synthetic DNA and our versatile DNA synthesis technology. Our current offering consists of two primary product lines, synthetic biology tools and NGS tools, that address different needs of our customers across a variety of applications, such as synthetic genes, oligo pools, SARS-CoV-2 tools and DNA libraries.
Synthetic Biology Products
Synthetic genes and gene fragments
Synthetic genes are manufactured strands of DNA. Customers order our synthetic genes to conduct a wide range of research, including product development for chemicals/materials, food/agriculture, therapeutics, diagnostics, data storage as well as a multitude of emerging applications within academic research. Virtually all research and development of this type requires trial and error, and our customers require many variations of genes to find the DNA sequence that achieves their objectives.
We offer two primary categories of synthetic genes: genes of perfect quality, clonal genes, in a vehicle to carry the DNA, also called a vector; and genes of near-perfect quality, non-clonal genes or fragments, that customers can place in their own vector. Within these two categories, customers can order different lengths of DNA depending on their required final gene construct. Customers can order longer genes or shorter genes and can stitch genes together to create longer or shorter constructs if desired.
Currently, we manufacture genes of up to 5,000 base pairs in length, yielding a clonally perfect piece of DNA that our customers can immediately use for their research. We offer non-clonal genes of up to 1,800 base pairs in length, which we believe addresses the vast majority of demand for non-clonal genes with an error rate of 1:7500 base pairs. We also offer larger quantities of DNA for customers who require it for their development efforts.

5



Oligonucleotide, or Oligo pools
Oligo pools, or high diversity collections of oligonucleotides, are utilized in many applications, including targeted NGS, CRISPR gene editing, mutagenesis experiments, DNA origami (the nanoscale folding of DNA to create two- and three-dimensional shapes at the nanoscale), DNA computing and data storage in DNA, among others. Our oligo pools are also used for high-throughput reporter assays that are used to study cell signaling pathways, gene regulation, and the structure of cell regulatory elements. For these applications, we provide customers with accurate and uniform synthetic oligos to precisely match their required designs.
We sell a diverse, customizable set of oligo pools, ranging from a few hundred oligos to over one million, and offer oligonucleotides of up to 300 nucleotides in length, with an error rate of 1:2000 nucleotides.
IgG proteins
Pairing the automation in our synthetic biology platform along with our expertise in antibody discovery, we introduced an immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein offering for our customers focused on drug discovery and development. In the process of antibody discovery, antibody fragments (Fab, small chain fragment variable (scFv) or VHH) must be reformatted to full IgGs. Leveraging its silicon-based synthesis platform, we provide customers with a high throughput IgG capability, removing this bottleneck from the antibody discovery process.
NGS tools
Building from our DNA synthesis platform, we have developed products for the growing NGS market. In particular, we are focused on addressing the demand for better sample preparation products that improve sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy, and reduce sequencing costs. Using our silicon-based DNA synthesis platform, we are able to synthesize exact sequences of interest. In the target enrichment process, our synthetic DNA probes bind to the sequence of interest within the sample, acting like a magnet to isolate and physically extract the targeted segment of DNA.
Our NGS products are primarily used for diagnostic tests for various indications including rare disease, SARS-CoV-2 and cancer through liquid biopsy. In addition, customers use our NGS tools for population genetics research and biomarker discovery, translational research, microbiology and applied markets research. Our customers are primarily diagnostic companies and hospitals, research institutions, agricultural biotechnology companies, and consumer genetics companies conducting diagnostic tests for a wide range of applications.
We offer a wide variety of NGS tools for our customers including library preparation kits, human exome kits, fixed and custom panels as well as Alliance panels, which are customer-curated content sold through Twist. In addition, we offer specific workflow solutions including a methylation detection kit for cancer, rare and inherited disease study, as well as a fast hybridization solution (FastHyb), which allows researchers to go from sample to sequencer in a single day.
Synthetic Viral Controls, Infectious Disease Research Tools
Leveraging our DNA synthesis platform, we launched a new product line of synthetic viral controls in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. We offer fully synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference sequences as positive controls for the development of both NGS and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Our SARS-CoV-2 controls are now included on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration website as reference materials.
In addition, we offer a wide range of respiratory viral controls including for influenzas, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. These controls can be used to provide quality control for the development, verification and ongoing validation of diagnostic tests. These controls for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory diseases allow researchers to develop tests safely and effectively, without working with live virus samples.
In addition, we introduced the SARS-CoV - 2 Research Panels, the Twist Respiratory Virus Panel and the Pan-Viral Research Panel, for the detection of disease in a research setting. All products can be used for environmental monitoring and surveillance testing, while also providing insight into the full sequence information for monitoring of viral evolution and strain origin.

Drug and Target Discovery Solutions
Precision DNA libraries
Our platform allows customers to customize every antibody sequence variation and construct a precise library systematically to target the entire region of interest. We can create single-site libraries in which we change a single amino acid (which is encoded by a group of three DNA nucleobases) within the sequence or single-site saturation libraries in which we change every amino acid within the sequence for a more comprehensive approach. We can also generate combinatorial libraries in which we introduce changes to multiple sites within the same gene in specific ratios and combinations. These libraries can be used for antibody engineering, affinity maturation, and humanization, which simplifies downstream screening and identifies more lead molecules. Our libraries are explicitly developed for a specific area of the genome or tailored to a specific disease, with antibody compounds evenly represented across all desired areas of the genome.
We have also developed a comprehensive antibody optimization solution to enable simultaneous optimization of multiple characteristics of a given antibody. We have developed custom software for the optimization of antibody hits, antibody compounds that meet pre-specified criteria for therapeutic development. We have added our high throughput and hyper-variant antibody library capabilities to create a comprehensive antibody optimization solution for potential partners. We are now using this solution to design, build and test hyper-variant, tightly controlled antibody libraries that follow the rules of the human repertoire and mitigate the pitfalls associated with traditional optimization methods. By following the rules of the human repertoire, which means including only DNA sequences known to occur in humans, we have created a “Library of Libraries” made up of many different individual libraries. These libraries are natural in composition and are expected to generate better drug development candidates. The libraries also have a large degree of synthetic variation, enabling simultaneous optimization of several antibody characteristics and the discovery of antibodies with high affinity and specificity to drug targets.
Identification and validation of antibodies for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
In 2020, we initiated antibody discovery using our biopharma platform, identifying potential antibodies that could be used for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 for research purposes. In addition, we tested several of these antibody candidates in live virus and advanced a subset through preclinical testing. In September 2021, The Coronavirus Immunotherapy Consortium (CoVIC), a joint academic-industry, non-profit collaborative research effort, performed the blinded analysis, confirming that our internally-developed antibody TB202-3 completely blocked the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from binding to the human ACE2 receptor. The results were published in the peer-reviewed journal Science. TB202-3 binds to a majority of known mutations, with the exception of the L452R mutation present in the Delta and Epsilon variants. Twist developed a new antibody which also binds and neutralizes the Delta and Epsilon variants, that is now advancing through late-stage discovery and validation testing.
Partnerships with leading companies
We believe we have several avenues available to monetize our antibody discovery program. In general, partnerships for our antibody development platform require us to provide rapid, on-demand (high affinity) antibodies based on one or more targets provided by the customer. These agreements typically have three elements with respect to the program:

● | We license and also utilize our “Library of Libraries,” a panel of synthetic antibody phage display libraries derived only from sequences that exist in the human body.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We work to discover, validate and optimize new antibody candidates against a specific target.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The customers pay Twist annual technology licensing fees, and increasingly, we receive project milestones for completion of various Twist activities and development milestones as our customers progress and commercialize the products. In many cases, we also receive royalties on any products coming out of the partnerships.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers can design and purchase libraries, and we work with partners that bring us a target, to discover antibody leads against that target. These partnerships generate revenue in up-front fees, through the license of libraries and service revenue. In addition, many of our partnerships include success-based milestones for key clinical, regulatory and commercial achievements and/or royalties on any product sales resulting from our collaboration.

7



In addition, for our internal development efforts, we have selected several promising targets and have identified antibody leads to these targets. We intend to out-license these compounds at later stages of preclinical development to optimize both the up-front revenue and larger milestones and royalties. By out-licensing antibody leads to experts in development and commercialization of biotechnology products, we can continue to focus on improving health through our proprietary platform. To date, we have generated antibody leads to Adora 2a, GLP1R (agonist and antagonists), SARS-CoV-2, TIGIT, PD-L1, CXCR4, CD3 as well as several undisclosed targets.
As of September 30, 2021, we had signed 34 revenue-generating partnerships. We have 41 completed programs and 41 active programs with 35 of the programs including milestones and/or royalties. Some of our partners include Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Adicet Bio, Kyowa Kirin, Invetx, Inc., and Neogene Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, we collaborate with companies that bring complementary technologies to expand our opportunities and reach.
Our growth strategy
Our objective is to be the leading provider of synthetic DNA and DNA-based products worldwide and to leverage our platform to build a leadership position in other life sciences markets in which we have a competitive advantage. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing on the following:

● | maintain and expand our position as the provider of choice for high-quality, affordable synthetic genes and DNA to customers across multiple industries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | become a leading supplier of NGS sample preparation products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | conduct antibody therapeutic discovery and optimization for our current customers and future partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to explore development of DNA as a digital data storage medium through internal research and government and industry partnerships; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expand our global presence.
--+----------------------------

Beyond these opportunities, we are working with industry partners to create new markets for our products by leveraging our platform.
Sales and marketing
We have built a versatile and scalable commercial platform that enables us to reach a diverse customer base that we estimate consists of over 100,000 synthetic DNA users, and many additional potential customers of our NGS library preparation products today. In order to address this diverse customer base, we have employed a multi-channel strategy comprised of a direct sales force targeting synthetic DNA customers, a direct sales force focusing on the NGS market and an e-commerce platform that serves both commercial channels. Our sales force is focused on customer acquisition, support, and management across industries, and is highly trained on both the technical aspects of our platform and how synthetic DNA can be used in a wide range of industries. Our easy-to-use e-commerce platform allows customers to design, validate, and place on-demand orders of customized DNA online, and enable them to receive real-time customized quotes for their products and track their order status through the manufacturing and delivery process. This is a critical part of our strategy to address our large market and diverse customer base, as well as drive commercial productivity, enhance the customer experience, and promote loyalty. We target customers of our NGS products through a direct sales team focused on the NGS tools market and which is separate from our synthetic DNA sales force. Our direct NGS sales representatives are focused on supporting our early adopters and providing a high level of service in order to familiarize customers with our product offerings.
We sell our products through a worldwide commercial organization that includes direct sales personnel, commercial consultants in Europe and Asia, an ecommerce platform and distributors. As of September 30, 2021, we employed 203 people in sales, marketing and customer support.
Research and development
We are engaged in ongoing research and development efforts focused on enhancements to existing products and the development of new products. Currently, we are pursuing research and development projects with respect to the following:

● | process development for higher quality oligos;
--+-----------------------------------------------

8




● | building a massively parallel fast turnaround time SynBio pipeline;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimization, automation and miniaturization of gene and NGS pipelines;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | silicon process and chemistry development for our data storage initiative;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | buildout of a massively parallel screening facility for our biopharma initiatives that allows us to screen over a dozen antibody phage display campaigns per week; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of our product offerings for oligo, gene, NGS library preparation and target enrichment, and DNA Libraries NGS products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June 2020, we executed a firm fixed-price subcontract with Georgia Institute of Technology to develop the DNA synthesis portion of the Molecular Information Storage program. The total cost for this subcontract is $6.5 million, and we are responsible for providing a minimum contribution of $2.0 million toward the cost of the program, with the remaining $4.5 million to be funded by the U.S. Director of Central Intelligence. We will receive such $4.5 million in funding in fixed amounts over a period from September 2019 to June 2022.
In December 2020, we executed a firm fixed-price subcontract for fulfilling an organization’s primary obligation to perform discovery activities and conduct applied research for technological innovations to improve human health. The subcontract was a $1.0 million research & development cost-reimbursement arrangement. The cost was reimbursed over a period from September 2020 to December 2020.
Research and development activities are conducted in collaboration with manufacturing activities to help expedite new products from the development phase to manufacturing and to more quickly implement new process technologies. From time to time, our research and development efforts have included participation in technology collaborations with universities and research institutions.
As of September 30, 2021, we employed 192 people in our research and development team.
Patents and other intellectual property rights
As of September 30, 2021, we own 33 issued U.S. patents and 24 issued international patents; four in China, three in Europe, six in South Korea, four in Taiwan, three in Japan, one in Eurasia, one in Singapore, one in Australia, and one in Hong Kong. There are 262 pending patent applications, including 72 in the United States, 176 international applications and 14 applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Additionally, we have exclusively licensed a patent portfolio containing ten issued patents, including one U.S. patent and nine international patents, and nine pending applications, including one in the U.S. and eight international applications. We have also licensed a patent portfolio containing two pending applications, including one in the US and one PCT. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business.
Manufacturing and facilities
The production of our products is a highly complex and precise process. We currently manufacture all of our products and multiple sub-assemblies at our manufacturing facility in South San Francisco, California. We also outsource some of our sub-assemblies to third party manufacturers. All of our products originate from synthetic DNA obtained from nanostructured clusters fabricated on our proprietary silicon technology platform. Due to its on-demand nature, the gene synthesis business requires manufacturing operations to be in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days per year. For synthetic genes, we have built a highly scalable gene production process with what we believe is industry-leading capacity to address the growing demand of scalable, high-quality, affordable synthetic genes. As of September 30, 2021, we employed 177 people in our manufacturing and facilities team.
In addition to synthetic genes, we manufacture oligo pools. The pooling process has been fully automated through a mixture of custom proprietary and over-the-counter liquid handling equipment. We are currently only utilizing approximately two thirds of our production capacity for synthetic genes and oligos. We have the capacity to make many millions of high-quality oligos per month that can be used to make genes and gene fragments of various lengths, oligo pools of various sizes, DNA libraries and NGS tools products. We intend to increase our shipments to leverage our production capacity through our e-commerce platform, which we believe will expand both our market opportunity and our customer base.

The manufacturing process for our NGS tools is highly flexible given the efficiency of our production capability. We have automated the entire workflow using proprietary and over-the-counter laboratory equipment. We have built dedicated production capabilities for our NGS products.
ISO Certification
In 2018, we certified our Quality Management System (QMS) to the ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management Systems—Requirements) standard and ISO 13485:2016 standard (Medical devices—Quality management systems—Requirements for regulatory purposes). ISO is a global network of national standards with over 18,000 standards for nearly every aspect of technology and business. ISO has standard bodies in 163 countries. ISO Surveillance Audits are carried out twice within a three-year period by the registrar (certification body) to ensure we maintain our system in compliance with ISO standards. Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification. Most recently, we were registered with the FDA as a manufacturer of “Reagents, 2019-novel coronavirus nucleic acid”.
In January 2019, our quality management systems for manufacturing our NGS Target Enrichment Panels in our Mission Bay San Francisco offices received ISO 9001:2015 and 13485:2016 certifications, the latter for medical device applications. In 2020, these certifications were extended to our South San Francisco offices. In addition to continuing to provide NGS tools to our current customer base, we now have the ability to support customers in more regulated markets that require ISO certification from their key reagent suppliers.
In July 2021, we withdrew from the ISO 9001:2015 certification and expanded the scope of our ISO 13485:2016 scope. The expansion introduced additional products, which conform to the ISO 13485:2016 standard. As our product portfolio expands, our customers demand that our reagents and controls conform to ISO 13485:2016. The new scope statement is, "Design, development, manufacture and distribution of oligonucleotide sequences and reagents used for development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and quality control measures".
Supply chain
We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased our supply of several materials and sourced additional suppliers for key materials to mitigate supply chain disruptions and ensure ongoing operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt our supply chain and although we continue to take steps to increase our safety stock and qualify other suppliers as it is very difficult to predict the future impact of the pandemic on our supply chain. As outbreaks of the virus continue to occur, we could potentially face disruption which could mean supply chain lead times are lengthened or we experience shortages and consequently this could impact our ability to produce and negatively impact our revenue.

Diversity is in our DNA. Our employees come from numerous countries and bring diversity to our workplace across many critical categories. We believe our company is stronger because of the variety of experiences and backgrounds our employees bring to their work every day.
We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment where our employees can bring their best selves to work each day. Our commitment to diversity extends through our recruitment, retention, learning and engagement and community partnerships. As part of our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging strategy, we made an active decision to pursue opportunities for learning and engagement that bring people from different backgrounds together into conversation. We’ve initiated monthly Culture Conversations where we explore identities and systems of power using an intersectional lens each month. Past topics include: disability, LGBTQIA+, ageism, Latinx identity, and more. Our objective is to appreciate each other as individuals with unique lived experiences, rather than define one another by a single trait such as race, sexual orientation or geographical location. To assess our efforts toward building a diverse workforce, we have included questions in our engagement survey to measure employee perception of inclusive culture.
In addition, we mandate training for all employees and managers to prevent workplace harassment. The course equips leaders and employees with the tools they need to identify and address unwelcome conduct in non-adversarial, respectful terms.

Recruiting
We believe that our employees are our most important asset. Beginning with the pre-recruitment process, we provide internship opportunities for students interested in biotechnology and the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields in both scientific and non-scientific departments. We engage with local communities to provide expert speakers sharing nontraditional career pathways for the biotechnology field. We partner with community colleges, historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-focused institutions to build our brand within diverse communities as a source of diverse, high-quality candidates for every role with the goal of identifying the best possible candidate to fill open positions within the company. We implemented a remote work policy which has resulted in a broader applicant pool because they aren’t limited to geographic location.
We actively engage with future scientists through organizations including the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM), a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering the field of synthetic biology. In addition, we have provided internships through the Gloucester Biotechnology Academy, a hands-on training program prepares students for careers as entry-level technicians in cutting-edge laboratories; and Eastside Preparatory Academy, a high school dedicated to serving students historically underrepresented in higher education.
With an active program in place for our employees, we are striving to further support our female and underrepresented employees in advancing their careers while continuing to focus on hiring diverse talent, particularly at more senior positions.
Compensation and benefits, health and wellness
We strive to provide pay, comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our generous total rewards package includes above-market pay; fully covered healthcare benefits for employees, with family member healthcare benefits covered at 90%; a health savings account that is fully funded for individuals and their families; approximately four weeks of paid vacation; a minimum of four months of parental leave for all employees globally; flexible work schedules; and onsite services. In addition, we offer every full-time employee, both exempt and non-exempt, the benefit of equity ownership in the company through stock option grants and our employee stock purchase plan.
We have an expert-built educational platform to assist employee’s fertility & family building needs with the help of treatment, fostering or adopting, plus dedicated resources for egg freezers, egg donation, LGBTQ+ families, and solo parents.
We have increased our well-being benefits, by offering programs that help workers monitor and reduce their stress levels, providing apps to support sleep and relaxation. We implemented a Walking Challenge to promote physical health and employee connections. We have further addressed employees’ emotional health and well-being by providing meditation sessions and using telehealth programs to offer mental health counseling.
COVID-19 employee safety and benefits
Many of our customers require our synthetic DNA products to provide critical tools for global health. Twist continues to take extra precautions to reduce the risk of virus exposure for all employees. All of our employees who were able to work from home will continue to do so through January 2022. For those employees who remain onsite to produce our products, we reduced the number of people in the office significantly with the remote work option. In addition, we comply with all local, state and federal mandates requiring masks indoors. We require all U.S. employees to be vaccinated and continue to provide PCR based testing of all on-site employees weekly. As a benefit for all employees, we provide flu shots for the employee and their family.
For any employee who contracts COVID-19, we provide full pay for their entire recovery and quarantine time, regardless of the guidelines of their home country. Twist pays sick leave for all affected employees at 100% of their salary or average hourly wages.
Employee health and safety
We remain steadfast in our commitment to promote the health and safety of our employees. We require annual workplace safety training to reinforce workplace safety procedures that may be useful in the event of emergency situations and to assist our employees in helping to prevent workplace accidents. Our Employee Health and Safety Committee, which is comprised of numerous cross-departmental members meets on a quarterly basis to review workplace safety and adherence to safety policies. As part of our efforts, all employees and managers complete workplace harassment and sexual harassment training that includes details on how to report any violation of these policies. 

12



Conduct and ethics
Our Board of Directors adopted and regularly reviews the Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our employees, directors and officers. We believe it is imperative that the board of directors and senior management strongly support a no-tolerance stance for workplace harassment, biases and unethical behavior. All employees are required to abide by, review and confirm compliance to the company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, our Anti-Money Laundering Policy, our Anti-Corruption Policy. We have established a reporting hotline and email address that enables employees to anonymously report any suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. 
In addition, because synthetic DNA is considered to be a dual use technology, we invest substantial financial and human resources in biosecurity to help ensure that our products are used for responsible research. We abide by all local, national and international regulations as well as trade compliance requirements and are an active member of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium and the Australia Group. We maintain an active relationship with the governing body for synthetic DNA within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
In 2021, our employees participated, through the Engineering Biology Research Consortium (EBRC), in a 'Malice Analysis' (MA) - a methodology for teaching synthetic biology researchers about both the importance of, and the how-to of, thinking through any security implications of their own research activities.
Growth and development
We invest significant financial and support resources to develop the talent we need to remain at the cutting edge of innovation to ensure Twist Bioscience is an employer of choice. We recently launched a new performance management system to support our culture, maintain consistency with our guiding principles and to focus on continuous learning and development. Our success in the market depends on employees understanding and embracing how their job contributes to the company’s overall strategy. We encourage cross team communication as well as integrated departmental communication. We believe this broadens our employee’s skill set and provides opportunity for growth and advancement. We invest in our next generation of leaders through a one-year leadership program for mid-level managers. In addition, we offer tuition reimbursement aimed at growth and career development.
We have made a significant investment in an online learning platform with on-demand, video-based content. Employees have the opportunity to refine or develop professional skills, learn new software, and explore as they plan their career growth. The platform also offers tremendous potential for managers and employees to create development plans as part of the performance review process.
Communications and engagement
We employ a variety of tools to facilitate open and direct communication including open forums with executives, employee surveys and engagement through focus groups, forums and committees. We endeavor to further refine our employee programs through our employee engagement survey as well as follow up quarterly pulse surveys. Based on the most recent survey conducted in July 2021 where 88% of our employees responded:

● | 96% of employees understand Twist’s mission
--+--------------------------------------------


● | 93% understand how they contribute to the mission of the company
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | 93% understand how their goals contribute to Twist
--+---------------------------------------------------

The executive leadership team identified key initiatives within their organizations that tie directly back to the survey feedback to further increase employee engagement moving forward.
We hold All Hands meetings twice per month as well as a monthly managers meeting for all people managers.
Community engagement, social and relationship capital
We are endeavoring to develop relationships, give back to our communities and engage in corporate social responsibility and sustainability initiatives. We provide all employees with eight fully paid hours each year to give back to the community at an organization of their choice. We are working to engage with the local community organizations to provide volunteer opportunities for our employees. As we grow our employee base, we will extend our efforts in these areas.

Environmental management
Many gene synthesis companies rely on oligonucleotide, or oligo (short pieces of DNA) synthesis on a plastic 96-well plate format. The 96-well plate allows researchers to create 96 oligos in parallel, one in each well. While this process can successfully achieve DNA synthesis, it requires high volumes of phosphoramidites, an expensive raw material, as well as other ancillary chemical reagents such as activator, wash, deblock, oxidizer and capping reagents, many of which are toxic and environmentally harmful. The reagent consumption levels vary depending on the DNA synthesizer and its setup.
At Twist, we developed an ultra-high-throughput DNA synthesis platform to address the limitations of throughput, scalability, and cost inherent in legacy DNA synthesis methods like that described above. With a footprint that is similar to the size of a 96-well plate that produces 96 oligos or 1 or 2 genes, we are able to produce approximately 1,000,000 oligos or 9,600 genes in parallel. 
With the Twist ultra-high-throughput DNA synthesizer, we believe we are able to achieve at least a 99.8% volume reduction (when compared to a standard manufacturer of oligos) in chemical consumption under the right circumstances compared to legacy oligo synthesis. For the more expensive chemical reagents (e.g., phosphoramidite and activator reagents), we have achieved nearly a 1,000,000-fold volume reduction. This drastic volume reduction is achieved through various engineering breakthroughs, including using of inkjet printing to deliver phosphoramidites and activator reagents (10 picoliter per droplet), and the development of proprietary flow cell chambers and reagent recipes, among other proprietary developments.
In addition, the legacy oligo synthesis process often produces significantly more oligos than is typically required for most subsequent processes. In contrast, the Twist system includes a fully-integrated and miniaturized molecular biology workflow to assemble genes using nearly 100% of the oligos we produced, yielding nearly zero wasted synthesized oligos and reducing the usage of molecular biology reagents (e.g., polymerase and other enzymes, and dNTP).
Overall, Twist’s process to synthesize DNA significantly reduces the quantity of chemicals used, overproduced product and waste, for a more sustainable production process.
Government regulation
Our synthetic DNA products are intended for “Research Use Only” (RUO). We sell these products for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes to academic institutions, life sciences and research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our products are neither intended nor promoted for clinical use, diagnostic procedures, or use as components of our customers products. Rather, they are intended to be used as research tools that enable our customers to develop a wide spectrum of commercial products. However, in the future we may be subject to a variety of specialized regulatory requirements, including potential regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. For example, in December 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the federal government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the federal government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms.
Aside from certain labeling requirements, we believe that our products, as currently marketed, are largely unregulated by governmental bodies, including the FDA. As we expand our product development to include products for clinical applications, we may be subject to a variety of specialized regulatory requirements, including regulation by the FDA, any of which could have a material effect on the business.
RUO is a term applicable to our target enrichment products for the next-generation sequencing (NGS) market and is applied to kits sold to this market segment. It is intended to restrict use of the kits to non-in vitro diagnostic purposes. Our NGS target enrichment and library preparation products are used in a more comprehensive workflow for next generation sequencing for research purposes only. In the future, we may develop this larger workflow as an in vitro diagnostic, for which we will obtain prior authorization from FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities before commercialization.

FDA
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices.
Medical device regulation in general
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared devices are generally categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a Premarket Approval Application, or PMA. However, FDA can reclassify or use “de novo classification” for a device that meets the FDC Act standards for a class II device, permitting the device to be marketed without PMA approval. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II. Class II classification usually requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, referred to as 510(k) clearance. Most Class I devices are exempt from this requirement, as are some lower risk Class II devices. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process.
All clinical studies of investigational medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations, including the requirement for the study sponsor to submit an IDE application to FDA, unless exempt, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical studies. PMA reviews generally last between one and two years, although they can take longer. Both the 510(k) and the PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy and may not result in clearance or approval. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
All medical devices, including in vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, that are regulated by the FDA are also subject to the Quality System Regulation. Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, including the FDA quality system inspections that are required for PMA approval, can be expensive, may involve delay, and could conclude without such products being approved by the FDA. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products. This may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory clearance or approval of our products in the future.
IVDs are a category of medical devices that include reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. IVDs are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. A RUO IVD product is an IVD product that is in the laboratory research phase of development. As such, an RUO IVD is not intended for use in clinical investigations or in clinical practice. Such RUO products do not require premarket clearance or approval from the FDA, provided that they be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not For Use In Diagnostic Procedures” pursuant to FDA regulations.
As noted above, although our products are currently intended for research purposes only, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling, and supporting such products could be uncertain and depend on the totality of circumstances. This uncertainty exists even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

17



According to the FDA, merely including the RUO labeling statement will not necessarily render the device exempt from FDA premarket clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intended its IVDs for diagnostic use. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the product’s advertising, labeling, or promotion, or the manufacturer’s assistance of a clinical laboratory in validating or verifying a test that incorporates products labeled RUO. This uncertainty exists even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
EU Regulation
In the European Union (EU), the new In Vitro Diagnostic Device Regulation (EU) 2017/746, or IVDR, imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of applicable medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The IVDR is expected to become effective in May 2022. We likely will be impacted by this new regulation, either directly as a manufacturer of IVDs, or indirectly as a supplier to customers who are placing IVDs in the EU market for clinical or diagnostic use. Complying with the IVDR requirements may require us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.
FSAP
The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) administer requirements of the Federal Select Agent Program, or FSAP. FSAP requirements govern possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins consisting of biological materials that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. The FSAP currently lists approximately 67 select agents and toxins, and approximately 247 entities were registered under FSAP to possess a select agent or toxin. The registered entities primarily consist of academic, federal and non-federal government, commercial, and private facilities that conduct research studies or diagnostic activities. We are not a registered entity under FSAP and it is our policy generally not to produce or otherwise work with any biological material that is subject to FSAP license requirements. To the extent that we may possess, use, or transfer any material considered a select agent or toxin under FSAP prospectively, we would seek to register with FSAP and obtain all necessary permits for possession, transfer, importation, or any other regulated activity.
Export controls
Some sequences and synthetic controls we produce may be subject to licensing requirements for export outside of the United States under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Given the evolving nature of our industry, legislative bodies or regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulation or expand existing regulation to include our service. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain comparable regulatory approval or clearance of our service, if required. These regulations and restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
