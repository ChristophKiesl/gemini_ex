Laser Annealing Systems
​
Our laser annealing systems meet the industry demand for ultra-short time-scale annealing, heating the wafer up to temperatures just below the silicon melting point over a range of timeframes (microseconds to nanoseconds), enabling thermal annealing solutions at the most advanced processing nodes. This unique annealing technology provides the solution to the difficult challenge of fabricating ultra-shallow junctions and highly activated source/drain contacts at these advanced logic nodes. In addition, our proprietary hardware design enables outstanding temperature uniformity across the wafer and die, by minimizing the pattern-density effect, thus reducing absorption variations.
​
We have also developed a next generation melt anneal technology targeted for memory devices and annealing advanced logic devices at advanced nodes. As devices scale, achieving performance targets has become a challenge. To continue the roadmap, the industry is looking at new materials and the use of thermal processes that require nanosecond time-scale thermal annealing with temperatures exceeding the melting point. It is believed that nanosecond annealing will be required to meet the device targets at future nodes.

Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a description of risks associated with intellectual property.
​
Human Capital
​
Veeco’s global workforce spans 12 countries around the world. At the end of 2020, we had 993 employees with 221 located in the Asia-Pacific region, 37 in the EMEA region, and 735 in the United States. Approximately 23% of our employees are involved in research and development; 53% are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 24% are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. We compete for talent with other companies and organizations. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, and regularly monitor all key employment activities, such as hiring, termination, pay and working practices to ensure compliance with such regulations. In addition, we supplement our employee base with contractors and other temporary workers. 
​
Our recruitment programs are regionally focused, and hiring is done at a local level to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. To ensure diversity within our workforce we advertise job openings and source candidates broadly to attract a diverse candidate pool. As a leader in our industry, we are able to attract a strong candidate pool and have been successful in filling vacancies. In fiscal 2020, we hired 138 employees, 113 of whom were within the United States, 24 of whom were in the Asia-Pacific region and 1 of whom was within the EMEA region. 
​
During fiscal 2019, we conducted a global employee survey designed to assess employee engagement, leadership, work environment and culture. We had a response rate of 91% of our total worldwide employee base, which is one indicator of a high-level of employee engagement. Participants provided over 2,000 responses to open-ended questions. The findings from this survey established an agenda for various initiatives designed to strengthen our Company. A follow-up survey is planned for fiscal 2021. 
 ​
We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, talent pipeline and diversity. We believe in investing in professional development programs to ensure we provide opportunities for individuals to advance their careers either in a technical track or move to a leadership position. We offer many of our training and development programs on-line for the benefit of employees located around the world. Additional focus is placed on the development of our future leaders and we leverage a talent review process where high-potential and high-performing employees are

assessed for future leadership roles as part of our succession management process for critical leadership positions. Since turnover is an important indicator of employee satisfaction, we closely monitor turnover globally and benchmark locally. Our 12-month rolling average for voluntary turnover at December 31, 2020 was approximately 6.8%, substantially less than benchmark data. Our employee average tenure is more than 9 years.
​
COVID-19 Update
​
As a result of the outbreak and continuing spread of COVID-19, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. We have important manufacturing operations in the United States and sales and support operations in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude certain essential services, and those essential services include critical infrastructure and the businesses that support that critical infrastructure. Our operations are considered part of the critical and essential infrastructure defined by applicable government authorities, and, although governmental measures to contain the pandemic may be modified or extended, our manufacturing facilities currently remain open. We believe our diverse product offerings and the critical nature of certain of our products for infrastructure insulate us, to some extent, from the adverse effects of the pandemic; however, a prolonged economic downturn will adversely affect our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, particularly if customers from whom we derive a significant amount of revenue reduce or delay purchases to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic or fail to make payments to us on time or at all.
​
We serve a global and highly interconnected customer base across the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and North America. Our net sales to customers located outside of the United States represented approximately 68%, 70%, and 77% of our total net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and we expect that net sales to customers outside the United States will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net sales. As a result, our business will be adversely impacted by further deterioration in global economic conditions, particularly in markets in Asia and Europe.
​
To date, we have not yet experienced any significant interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor our global supply chain and may experience disruptions in future periods, primarily as a result of financial challenges confronting companies in our supply chain and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, any of which could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products.
​
Like many in our industry, we are managing through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business, results of operations, supply chains and growth can not be predicted or quantified, we proactively identified potential challenges to our business and have been executing business continuity activities to manage disruptions in our business and continue to provide critical infrastructure to our customers. In response to the pandemic, we have taken, or intend to take, the following steps, among others, to keep our employees safe and minimize the spread of the virus, while continuing to serve our customers:
​

● | implemented rigorous health and safety protocols at our manufacturing facilities, including extensively and frequently disinfecting our facilities, limiting access to our facilities, checking temperatures of individuals entering our facilities, staggering shifts to minimize employee overlap in gowning areas, and providing protective equipment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | mandated remote working arrangements for employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or at customer facilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | implemented virtual meetings, customer demos, and factory acceptances to enable customers to review data and performance of their system in our factory remotely via live video;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11



​

● | performing service and support activities remotely to resolve customer issues and enable our customers to maintain their operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | proactively identified gaps in our supply chain and re-sourced a number of components in order to maintain our customer shipment commitments and mitigate single points of failure;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | monitoring our IT systems and implementing contingency and disaster recovery plans to support our IT infrastructure to ensure that our systems remain continuously operative; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | continuing to monitor and, if necessary, reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures to maintain financial flexibility and profit margins.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
While these steps have been effective so far, there could be additional challenges ahead that may impact either our operations or those of our customers, which could have a negative effect on our financial performance, including productivity and capacity impacts as a result of the ongoing pandemic. We expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers and suppliers. As a result, we may incur additional expenses in future periods in response to the pandemic, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees and customers, and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business.
