ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE CORPORATION
Union Carbide Corporation is a chemicals and polymers company that has been a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company ("TDCC") since 2001. Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "Corporation" or "UCC" as used herein mean Union Carbide Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
On April 1, 2019, DowDuPont Inc. (“DowDuPont” and effective June 3, 2019, n/k/a DuPont de Nemours, Inc.) completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of TDCC and its consolidated subsidiaries. The separation was contemplated by the merger of equals transaction effective August 31, 2017, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017. TDCC and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Historical DuPont") each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont, and, as a result, TDCC and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the “Merger”). Subsequent to the Merger, TDCC and Historical DuPont engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. This included transferring certain Corporation assets and liabilities aligned with the specialty products business to TDCC. Dow Inc. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont to serve as the holding company for the materials science business. UCC remains a wholly owned subsidiary of TDCC. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
TDCC conducts its worldwide operations through global businesses. UCC's business activities comprise components of TDCC's global businesses rather than stand-alone operations. Because there are no separate reportable business segments for UCC and no detailed business information is provided to a chief operating decision maker regarding the Corporation's stand-alone operations, the Corporation's results are reported as a single operating segment. In addition, in order to simplify the customer interface process, the Corporation sells substantially all of its products to TDCC. Products are sold to TDCC at prices determined in accordance with the terms of an agreement between UCC and TDCC.

PRODUCTS
The following is a description of the Corporation's principal products:
Ethylene Oxide/Ethylene Glycol (“EO/EG”) - ethylene oxide, a chemical intermediate primarily used in the manufacture of monoethylene glycol (“MEG”), polyethylene glycol, glycol ethers, ethanolamines, surfactants and other performance chemicals and polymers; di- and triethylene glycol, used in a variety of applications, including boat construction, shoe manufacturing, natural gas-drying and other moisture-removing applications, and plasticizers for safety glasses; and tetraethylene glycol, used predominantly in the production of plasticizers for automotive windows. MEG is used extensively in the production of polyester fiber, resin and film, automotive antifreeze and engine coolants, and aircraft anti-icing and deicing fluids.
Hydrocarbons - ethylene and propylene; internal feedstocks that are primarily consumed by downstream product lines to optimize integration benefits and drive low costs.
Industrial Chemicals and Polymers - broad range of products for specialty applications, including animal food supplements, personal care, industrial and household cleaning, coatings for beverage and food cans, industrial coatings and many other industrial uses. Product lines include acrolein and derivatives, ethyleneamines, CARBOWAX™ and SENTRY™ Polyethylene Glycols and Methoxypolyethylene Glycols, TERGITOL™ and TRITON™ Surfactants, UCAR™ Deicing Fluids, UCARTHERM™ Heat Transfer Fluids and UCON™ Fluids.
Polyethylene - includes FLEXOMER™ Polyethylene, very low-density polyethylene resins used as impact modifiers in other polymers and to produce flexible hose and tubing, frozen-food bags and stretch wrap; TUFLIN™ Linear Low Density and UNIVAL™ High Density Polyethylene resins used in high-volume applications such as housewares; milk, water, bleach and detergent bottles; grocery sacks; trash bags; packaging; and water and gas pipe.
Solvents and Intermediates - includes oxo aldehydes, acids and alcohols used as chemical intermediates and industrial solvents and in herbicides, plasticizers, paint dryers, jet-turbine lubricants, lube oil additives, and food and feed preservatives; and esters, which serve as solvents in industrial coatings and printing inks and in the manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals and polymers.
Technology Licensing and Catalysts - includes catalysts for supply and licensing of the METEOR™ Process for EO/EG and the LP OXO process for oxo alcohols; and licensing of the METEOR™ Process for EO/EG and the LP OXO process for oxo alcohols through Dow Technology Investments LLC, a 50:50 joint venture with Dow Global Technologies LLC, a TDCC subsidiary.
Vinyl Acetate Monomer - a building block for the manufacture of a variety of polymers used in water-based emulsion paints, adhesives, paper coatings, textiles, safety glass and acrylic fibers.
Wire and Cable Applications - polyolefin-based compounds for high-performance insulation, semiconductives and jacketing systems for power distribution, telecommunications, and flame-retardant wire and cable insulation.

COMPETITION
The chemical industry has been historically competitive and this competitive environment is expected to continue. Large, multinational chemical firms, as well as the chemical divisions of the major national and international oil companies, provide substantial competition both in the United States and abroad.
PATENTS, LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS
