 Item 1. Business
     Company Overview
 Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (Genesis) is a holding company with subsidiaries that, on a consolidated basis, comprise one of the nation's largest post-acute care providers.  As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” and similar terms, refer collectively to Genesis and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.  We offer inpatient services through our network of 381 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities located in 26 states.  We also supply rehabilitation and respiratory therapy to approximately 1,200 locations in 44 states, the District of Columbia and China as of December 31, 2019.  In addition, we provide a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators through our administrative services subsidiaries and to third-party operators with whom we contract through our management services subsidiary. There were 19 facilities subject to such management services agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators as of December 31, 2019. All of our healthcare operating subsidiaries focus on providing quality care to the people we serve, and our skilled nursing facility subsidiaries, which comprise the largest portion of our consolidated business, have a strong commitment to treating patients who require a high level of skilled nursing care and extensive rehabilitation therapy, whom we refer to as high-acuity patients.  For additional information regarding our financial condition, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Overview.”     Operations
 As of December 31, 2019, we offered inpatient services through our network of 381 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities across 26 states, consisting of 357 skilled nursing facilities and 24 stand-alone assisted/senior living facilities. Of the 381 facilities, 299 are leased, 30 are owned, 13 are managed and 39 are joint ventures. Additionally, we have fixed-price options to purchase the real property of 23 of our leased facilities and 33 of our joint venture facilities. Collectively, our skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities have 45,136 licensed beds, approximately 70% of which are concentrated in the states of California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. See Item 2. “Properties” for the full count of facilities by state.  Our skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities are generally clustered in large urban or suburban markets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated approximately 84% of our revenue from our skilled nursing facilities, with the remainder primarily being generated from our assisted/senior living facilities, rehabilitation therapy services provided to third-party facilities, and other ancillary services.
 Our services focus primarily on the medical and physical issues facing elderly patients and are provided by the employees of our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living communities, integrated and third-party rehabilitation therapy business, and other ancillary services.

 As of December 31, 2019, we had three reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities and is the largest portion of our business; (2) rehabilitation therapy services, which includes our integrated and third-party rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services; and (3) all other services. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the inpatient services segment generated approximately 87% of our revenue, the rehabilitation therapy services segment generated approximately 10% of our revenue and all other services accounted for the remaining balance of our revenue. For additional information regarding the financial performance of our reportable operating segments, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7 – “Segment Information,” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Inpatient Services Segment
 Skilled Nursing Facilities
 As of December 31, 2019, our skilled nursing facilities provided skilled nursing care at 357 regionally clustered facilities, having 41,977 licensed beds, in 26 states.  We have developed programs for, and actively market our services to, high-acuity patients who are typically admitted to our facilities as they recover from strokes, other neurological conditions, cardiovascular and respiratory ailments, joint replacements and other muscular or skeletal disorders.  We also provide 24-hour long-term care services for elderly residents and people with chronic conditions or prolonged illnesses. Our staff is devoted to providing a comforting environment and focused on helping each person achieve their highest level of independence and vitality.
 We use interdisciplinary teams of experienced medical professionals to provide services prescribed by physicians. These teams include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants and other professionals who provide individualized comprehensive nursing care to our short-stay and long-stay patients.  Many of our skilled nursing facilities are equipped to provide specialty care, such as on-site dialysis, ventilator care, cardiac and pulmonary management.  We also provide standard services to each of our skilled nursing patients, including room and board, special nutritional programs, social services, recreational activities and related healthcare and other services.
 Our PowerBack Rehabilitation branded facilities are designed to provide short-stay skilled nursing facilities that deliver a comprehensive rehabilitation regimen in accommodations specifically designed to serve high-acuity patients. We believe that having PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities enables us to more effectively serve higher acuity patients and achieve a higher skilled mix than a traditional hybrid skilled nursing facility, which in turn results in higher reimbursement rates. Skilled mix is the average daily number of Medicare and insurance patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the average daily number of total patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities.  Insurance as a payor source includes both traditional commercial insurance programs as well as managed care plans, including Medicare Advantage plans.  As of December 31, 2019, we operated 10 PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities with 1,075 beds.
 As of December 31, 2019, we have 19 facilities subject to management agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators. The income associated with the management services provided to the third-party facility operator is included in inpatient services in our segment reporting as services are performed primarily by personnel supporting the inpatient services segment. 
 Our administrative service company provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators to allow them to better focus on the delivery of healthcare services.
 Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
 We complement our skilled nursing care business by providing assisted/senior living services at 24 stand-alone facilities with 1,941 beds and offer an additional 1,218 assisted/senior living beds within our skilled nursing facilities as of December 31, 2019. Our assisted/senior living facilities provide residential accommodations, activities, meals, security, housekeeping and assistance in the activities of daily living to seniors who are independent or who require some support, but not the level of nursing care provided in a skilled nursing facility.  Rehabilitation Therapy Services
 As of December 31, 2019, we provided rehabilitation therapy services, including speech-language pathology (SLP), physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and respiratory therapy, to approximately 1,200 healthcare locations in 44 states, the District of Columbia and China, including 349 facilities operated by us. We provide rehabilitation therapy services at our skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities as part of an integrated service offering in connection with our skilled nursing care.  We believe that an integrated approach to treating high-acuity patients enhances our ability to achieve successful patient outcomes and enables us to 

 
  2
 
identify and treat patients who can benefit from our rehabilitation therapy services. We believe hospitals and physician groups often refer high-acuity patients to our skilled nursing facilities because they recognize the value of an integrated approach to providing skilled nursing care and rehabilitation therapy services.  
 We believe that we have also established a strong reputation as a premium provider of rehabilitation therapy services to third-party skilled nursing operators in our local markets, with a recognized ability to provide these services to high-acuity patients. Our approach to providing rehabilitation therapy services for third-party operators emphasizes quality treatment and successful clinical outcomes. 
 In addition to our rehabilitation therapy services in the United States, we have a presence in China and Hong Kong with initiatives to develop a rehabilitation therapy care delivery model and other services.  The revenues generated and long-lived assets associated with this expansion are immaterial as of December 31, 2019. 
 Other Services
 As of December 31, 2019, we provided an array of other specialty medical services, including physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services.
     Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2019, we employed an aggregate of approximately 55,000 active employees as follows:  36,250 in our inpatient services segment, 11,800 (primarily therapists) in our rehabilitation therapy segment, and 6,950 in our all other services segment, which includes our administrative services subsidiaries.  
 Our most significant operating cost is labor, which accounted for approximately 65% of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The healthcare industry as a whole has been challenged by shortages of qualified healthcare professionals, resulting in increased competition for staffing services and increased employee turnover.  Consequently, we have instituted various strategies, such as maintaining competitive labor rates and benefits, that seek to improve employee retention and reduce reliance on overtime compensation and temporary staffing services.  Most of our skilled nursing facilities are subject to state-mandated minimum staffing requirements, so our ability to reduce labor costs by decreasing staff is limited and subject to government audits and penalties.  Managing labor costs is proving to be increasingly difficult as reimbursement rate increases are often significantly exceeded by the annual inflationary wage increases. The issue is compounded by the shift in payor mix to lower reimbursed Medicaid as well as increases in the federal or state minimum wage rates.
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 83 collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 5,200 active employees at our skilled nursing facilities. As these agreements are renegotiated, we may be subject to wage increases in excess of market rates. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
     Customers
 With the exception of our rehabilitation therapy services segment, no individual customer or client accounts for a significant portion of our revenue. We do not expect that the loss of a single customer or client within our inpatient services segment would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Within the rehabilitation services business, there are over 140 distinct customers, many of which are chain operators with more than one location.  One customer, which is a related party of ours, comprises $28.9 million, approximately 34%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2019.  See Note 16 – “Related Party Transactions.”  One former customer comprises $7.0 million, approximately 8%, of the gross outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2019.     Business Strategy
 We believe that we are well positioned to succeed in what will be an increasingly integrated healthcare delivery system.  Our core strategy is to provide superior clinical outcomes with an approach that is patient-centered and focused on lowering costs by reducing lengths of stay and improving outcomes by developing programs to prevent avoidable rehospitalizations.

 The key elements of our business strategy include:
 Commitment to quality care.  We are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and improve the care provided in our facilities.  We continually seek to enhance our reputation for providing clinical capabilities and favorable outcomes.  Among other things, we have and will continue to increase our professional nursing mix and integrate nurse practitioners and employed physicians into our clinical model.  We have incentivized our management team to improve clinical performance to further ensure accountability for the quality of care. 
 Position ourselves for success in a value-based environment. As healthcare reform continues to be implemented, we believe post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals and operate with scale will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  Our ongoing clinical and operational initiatives position us as a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models.
 Improve operating efficiency.  We are continually focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling costs, while maintaining quality patient care.  Investments in information systems, the development of tools to more effectively manage operating costs and the reengineering of key business and operating processes are an effective way to grow cash flow and improve operating margins.  Such investments involve significant upfront costs that must be assessed on a long-term cost-benefit basis and can be limited due to our available liquidity.
 Focusing on core markets by optimizing our facility portfolio.  We are continually evaluating the long-term strategic value of our portfolio of facilities and other operating businesses.  In this regard, we will continue to pursue the sale, divestiture, closure or reconfiguration of facilities or businesses that are unprofitable, located in unattractive or saturated markets, physically obsolete or not core to our business strategy.  Shedding non-core or non-strategic assets increases our focus and resources to assets in markets where we have geographic density, strong hospital partnerships and the greatest growth potential.  Between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, we have divested, sold or closed the operations of 129 facilities.  We seek strategic acquisitions in selected target markets with strong demographic trends for growth in our service population.  Expansion of existing facility clusters and the creation of new clusters in local markets will allow us to leverage existing operations and to achieve greater operating efficiencies.
     Improving overall capital structure and focusing on real estate ownership and strategic partnerships. In early 2018,  we executed a number of restructuring activities to provide increased liquidity and reduce annual cash fixed charges.  These activitities included closing on a new asset based lending facility, expansion of an existing term loan agreement, and the restructuring of several significant master leases, which resulted in more favorable terms. We currently lease the majority of the facilities used in our operations, many of which are subject to annual rent escalation clauses.  We are continually focused on reducing the impact of rising rents through the restructuring of existing lease arrangements, the acquisition of real estate, and the execution of other strategic partnerships. Further, we seek to own facilities or acquire fixed price options to purchase them, thus allowing us to participate in the upside appreciation of the facilities and the opportunity to lower our future costs by replacing rent subject to escalators with debt financing.
 Since January 1, 2019, we entered into two strategic partnerships that provide us with fixed price options to purchase the underlying real property of an aggregate of 34 facilities and contain rental terms with no annual escalators for at least four years.   See Note 4 – “Significant Transactions and Events – Strategic Partnerships” and Note 23 – “Subsequent Events.” 
 Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we entered into an additional strategic partnership under which we transferred operational responsibility for 19 facilities to an operator with local market expertise and relationships.  Under the terms of the arrangement, we will continue to provide administrative support to the facilities and also provide certain ancillary services.  See Note 23 – “Subsequent Events.”
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths support our business strategy:
 Quality Patient Care, Differentiated Clinical Capabilities and Clinical Specialization. To ensure clinical oversight and continuity of patient care, our facilities contract with our physician services division to obtain services of physicians, physician assistants and nurse 

 
  4
 
practitioners that are primarily involved in providing medical direction and/or direct patient care. Utilization of physicians and non-physician practitioners allows for significant patient involvement at all levels of the organization, thus ensuring an emphasis on quality care is maintained.  In an effort to further enhance the quality of care we provide to our patients, we have made investments to expand rehabilitation gym capacity and develop clinical specialty units. The development of clinical specialty units in our facility portfolio has allowed us to better meet the needs of our patients.  These specialty units, along with our advanced capabilities in post-acute cardiac and pulmonary management, differentiate us in local areas, as competitors often do not offer these programs.  Our focus on quality patient care, differentiated clinical capabilities and clinical specialization allows us to care for higher acuity patients who are typically reimbursed by Medicare or managed care payors.
 Strong Geographic Density in Regional Markets.  We have developed geographic density in markets with 70% of our total licensed skilled nursing beds located in nine states: California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Within these and other states, we seek to cluster our facilities to create a dense, localized footprint.   By clustering our facilities, we are able to provide a larger and more diverse number of clinical services within a regional market.  As a result, we are often the leading skilled nursing facility operator in many of the regional markets in which we operate, based on number of beds.  Strategically clustered facilities in single or contiguous markets also allow us to achieve lower operating costs through greater purchasing power and operating efficiencies, facilitate the development of strong relations with state and local regulators and provide us with the ability to coordinate sales and marketing strategies.  Our strong reputation and operating performance in regional markets also allows us to develop relationships with key referral sources, including hospitals and other managed care payors.
 Experienced Management Team with Proven Operating Performance. We have an experienced management team with deep post-acute experience. Our management team has demonstrated an ability to adapt to a rapidly changing business climate, providing a distinct competitive advantage in navigating the complex and evolving post-acute care industry.
 Key Partnerships and Relationships. We have partnered with hospitals in our local markets to enhance the coordination of patient care during and after a post-acute rehabilitation stay. The goal of these relationships is to provide quality care while lowering hospital readmission rates and reducing overall healthcare costs.  Further, these relationships allow us to manage patient outcomes and coordinate care once a patient leaves the acute care setting and enters one of our facilities.  We have also forged key relationships with managed care payors to better align quality goals and reimbursement, resulting in a more coordinated care approach that reduces hospital readmissions.  As an increasing number of patients gain access to health insurance through healthcare reform or move to managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are poised to capture additional market share as managed care companies look to match quality patient care with a cost efficient setting. In addition, we created our own Accountable Care Organization (ACO).  As the industry continues to migrate from fee-for-service to pay-for-value, our unique capabilities in the area of physician services has given us a competitive advantage in advancing participation in value-based programs.  We offer the only captive SNFist company in the industry and the only post-acute sponsored ACO in the United States.
 Leading Post-Acute Provider Well Positioned for Increased Demand for Post-Acute Care. As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the U.S. population, we believe overall demand for the services we provide will increase.  As one of the largest operators of skilled nursing facilities and post-acute rehabilitation therapy services in the U.S., we are well positioned to benefit from these trends by delivering cost effective, high quality services.

 Competition
 Our skilled nursing facilities compete primarily on a local and regional basis with other skilled nursing facilities and with assisted/senior living facilities, from national and regional chains to smaller providers owning as few as a single facility. Competitors include other for-profit providers as well as non-profits, religiously-affiliated facilities, and government-owned facilities. We also compete under certain circumstances with inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) and long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals. Increasingly, we are competing with home health and community based providers who have developed programs designed to provide services to seniors outside an institutional setting, extending the time period before they need the higher level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility.  In addition, some competitors are implementing vertical alignment strategies, such as hospitals who provide long-term care services. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors, including the number of competing facilities in the local market and the types of services available at those facilities, our local reputation for quality care of patients, the commitment and expertise of our caregivers, our local service offerings and treatment programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our facilities.
 We seek to compete effectively in each market by establishing a reputation within the local community for quality of care, attractive and comfortable facilities, and providing specialized healthcare with an emphasized focus on high-acuity patients. Programs targeting high-acuity patients, including our PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities, generally have a higher staffing level per patient than our other inpatient facilities and compete more directly with an IRF or LTAC hospitals, in addition to other skilled nursing facilities. We believe that the average cost to a third-party payor for the treatment of our typical high-acuity patient is lower if that patient is treated in one of our skilled nursing facilities than if that same patient were to be treated in an IRF or LTAC hospital.
     Our other services, such as assisted/senior living facilities and rehabilitation therapy provided to third-party facilities, also compete with local, regional, and national companies. The primary competitive factors in these businesses are similar to those for our skilled nursing facilities and include reputation, cost to provide the services, quality of clinical services, responsiveness to patient/resident needs, location and the ability to provide support in other areas such as information management and patient recordkeeping.
     Increased competition could limit our ability to attract and retain patients, attract and retain employees or to expand our business. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, may have greater brand recognition and may be more established in their respective communities than we are. Competing companies may also offer newer facilities or different programs or services than we do and may as a result be more attractive to our current patients, to potential patients and to referral sources. 
 Industry Trends
 We believe the following post-acute care industry trends are likely to impact our business: 
     Increased Demand Due to Favorable Demographics. The majority are our services are provided to individuals aged 75 and older.  This population is one of the fastest growing segments in the United States. We expect that as the number of individuals aged 75 and older continues to increase, we will experience an increase in demand for our services.
     Shift of Care to Lower Cost Alternatives. In response to rising healthcare costs, governmental and other payors have adopted various cost-containment measures that serve to reduce admissions and encourage reduced lengths of stay in hospitals and other post-acute settings.  Consequently, these providers are discharging patients earlier and referring incremental high-acuity patients to lower cost settings, such as skilled nursing facilities. 
     Limited Supply of Facilities. There has been a moderate decline in the number of skilled nursing facilities over the past several years. Additionally, most states impose strict regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare projects.  Consequently, we believe that as the industry demographics continue to trend positively, the supply and demand balance in the industry will continue to improve.
     Reduced Reliance on Family Care. We believe that increases in the percentage of dual income earning families, reductions in the average family size, and an increased mobility in society will lessen seniors’ reliance on family as a form of care.  We believe that it will be necessary for more seniors to seek alternative care options as they age, which will increase the demand for our services.

 Healthcare Reform and Reimbursement Trends.  In recent years, healthcare reforms and other policy changes have reshaped the healthcare payment and delivery landscape in the United States.  A significant objective of these reforms is to transform delivery of and payment for healthcare services by holding providers accountable for the cost and quality of care provided.  In response to these reforms, Medicare and many commercial third party payors have implemented ACO models in which groups of providers share in the benefit and risk of providing care to an assigned group of individuals.  Other reimbursement methodology reforms include value-based purchasing, in which a portion of provider reimbursement is redistributed based on relative performance on designated economic, clinical quality and patient satisfaction metrics.  In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented demonstration and mandatory programs to bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans.  As alternative payment models seek to incentivize delivery of better care at lower costs, providers are making fundamental changes in their day-to-day operations to better coordinate and manage the care of patients, improve care transitions, reduce lengths of stay and prevent avoidable rehospitalizations.
     Further, continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain the rate of payment for the provision of healthcare services has impacted providers like us.  Federal Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates in many states are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. In recent years, those adjustments have not reflected actual increases in the cost of providing healthcare services. In addition to rate pressure, in recent years we have continued to see a shift from “traditional” Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare patients to Medicare Advantage patients.  Reimbursement rates and average lengths of stay are generally lower for services provided to Medicare Advantage patients than they are for the same services provided to traditional FFS Medicare patients, negatively impacting our profitability.  In addition to the federal Medicare program, a number of states use managed care to coordinate long-term care support services and many states are interested in implementing or expanding existing ones.  The emergence of managed Medicaid programs has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement for our services and has introduced new challenges and complexities with respect to billings and collections. We expect further migration towards managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
     Revenue Sources
     We derive revenue primarily from the following programs: Medicaid, Medicaid Managed Care, Medicare, Medicare Advantage Plans, commercial insurance payors and private pay patients.
      Medicaid
     Medicaid, which is the largest source of funding for skilled nursing facilities, typically covers patients that require standard room and board services, and provides reimbursement rates that are generally lower than rates earned from other sources. Medicaid is a program financed by state funds and matching federal funds administered by the states and their political subdivisions. Medicaid programs generally provide health benefits for qualifying individuals, and may supplement Medicare benefits for the disabled and for persons aged 65 and older meeting financial eligibility requirements. Medicaid reimbursement formulas are established by each state with the approval of the federal government in accordance with federal guidelines. Seniors who enter skilled nursing facilities as private pay clients can become eligible for Medicaid once they have substantially depleted their assets.
     Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment, case mixed adjusted payments and negotiated rate systems. Reimbursement rates are subject to a number of factors, such as a state’s annual budgetary requirements and funding, statutory and regulatory changes and interpretations and rulings by authoritative agencies.
     Medicaid Managed Care
     Medicaid Managed Care is a health care delivery system of Medicaid health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between state Medicaid agencies and managed care organizations (MCOs) designed to manage cost, utilization and quality of care.  The delivery of long-term care services is provided through capitated payment programs.  Such programs are in place in the majority of states in which we operate and states may implement such programs in the future if approved by CMS.

 Medicare
     Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare benefits to individuals who are aged 65 years and older or are disabled. To achieve and maintain Medicare certification, a skilled nursing facility must sign a Medicare provider agreement and meet the CMS “Requirements of Participation” on an ongoing basis, as determined in periodic facility inspections or “surveys” conducted primarily by the state licensing agency in the state where the facility is located.  Medicare pays for inpatient skilled nursing facility services under the prospective payment system (PPS). The prospective payment for each beneficiary is based upon the medical condition of and care needed by the beneficiary. Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility coverage is limited to 100 days per episode of illness for those beneficiaries who require daily care following discharge from an acute care hospital.
· | Medicare Part A provides for inpatient services including hospital care, skilled nursing care, hospice and home healthcare, and end-stage renal disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part B provides for outpatient services including physician services, diagnostic services, durable medical equipment, skilled therapy services and medical supplies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part C is a managed care option (Medicare Advantage) for beneficiaries who are entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B and are administered by commercial health insurers that contract with Medicare or Medicaid.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medicare Part D is a benefit that provides prescription drug benefits for both Medicare and Medicare/Medicaid dual eligible patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Medicare reimbursed our skilled nursing facilities under PPS for a defined bundle of inpatient covered services. Medicare coverage criteria require that a beneficiary spend at least three qualifying days in an inpatient acute setting before Medicare will cover the skilled nursing service. While beneficiaries are eligible for up to 100 days per episode of illness of skilled nursing care services (defined as requiring daily skilled nursing and/or skilled rehabilitation services), current law imposes a daily co-payment after the 20th day of covered services. Under PPS, facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient, per day, for certain services based on the anticipated costs of treating patients.  Effective October 1, 2019, the amount to be paid is determined based on a new case-mix classification system known as the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM). Prior to this date, payment rates were determined by classifying each patient into a resource utilization group (RUG) category based upon each patient's acuity level. 
     Medicare rules and reimbursement rates are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services.  Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins.
     For Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the Medicare Part A coverage, rehabilitation services are included in the per diem payment. For beneficiaries who do not meet the coverage criteria for Part A services, rehabilitation services may be provided under Medicare Part B, subject to specific coverage and payment requirements.
     Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM)
     Effective October 1, 2019, a new case-mix classification system called PDPM replaced the existing case-mix classification system, RUG-IV.  PDPM is designed to increase focus on patients’ conditions and clinical needs, as opposed to the volume of services provided, thereby improving payment accuracy and encouraging a more patient-driven care model.  Under PDPM, there are only two required minimum data set (MDS) assessments, the admission assessment and discharge assessment, with one optional MDS assessment, the interim payment assessment.
     PDPM utilizes a combination of six components to determine the amount of the per diem payment.  Five of the components are case-mix adjusted, meaning they are intended to cover the utilization of skilled nursing facility resources that vary according to patient characteristics. These components are as follows:  PT, OT, SLP, non-therapy ancillary (NTA) services, and nursing. The sixth component is non-case-mix adjusted, meaning it is intended to cover those skilled nursing facility resources that do not vary by patient.  The PT, OT, and NTA components are also subject to a variable adjustment factor that serves to adjust the per diem payment over the course of the patient’s stay. PT and OT services have variable per diem adjustments beginning on the 21st day of the Medicare stay and 

 
  8
 
further adjusted every seven days thereafter.  NTA services have variable per diem adjustments beginning on the 4th day of the Medicare stay.  PDPM utilizes patient specific, data-driven characteristics to classify patients into payment groups within each of the six components, which are used as the basis for the payment amount.
     Effective October 1, 2019, CMS has also revised the definition of skilled nursing facility group therapy so that it aligns with the group therapy definition used in the inpatient rehabilitation facility setting.  The new definition defines group therapy in the skilled nursing facility Medicare Part A setting as a qualified rehabilitation therapist or therapy assistant treating two to six patients at the same time who are performing the same or similar activities.
     PDPM also revises the limits on group and concurrent therapy.  RUG-IV included a 25% limit per discipline (PT, OT, SLP), for group therapy and did not impose a limit for concurrent therapy.  PDPM includes a 25% limit per discipline (PT, OT, SLP) for both combined group and concurrent therapy.
     CMS has finalized the implementation of PDPM in a budget neutral manner and has updated the unadjusted federal per diems and related case mix groups (CMGs) and related Case Mix Indices (CMIs).  Under CMIs, there are differences between RUG-IV and PDPM in terms of patient classifications and billing.  CMS has reflected these differences by modifying the PDPM case mixed adjusted federal rates and associated indexes through the application of a CMI multiplier for each PDPM Group.
     Part B Rehabilitation Requirements
     We receive payment for certain of our services from the Medicare Part B program under a fee schedule. The payments we received for these services was limited by separate “therapy caps” for combined SLP and PT services and OT services. The therapy caps were implemented under the authority of the Balanced Budget Amendments of 1997.  
     Congress has historically interceded on several occasions to suspend the therapy caps, offering an exceptions process to permit the processing of claims in excess of the therapy cap. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 directed CMS to develop a process that allows exceptions to therapy cap limits when continued therapy is deemed medically necessary.  Specifically, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended the exceptions process but added a second tier cap mandating manual medical review (MMR) for claims submitted that exceeded $3,700 for combined SLP and PT services and a separate threshold of $3,700 for OT services. In April 2015, The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) was signed into law. MACRA authorized payment reforms for physicians and other professional services, including SLP, PT, and OT services. Further, it included provisions to not only stabilize the professional fee schedules, but also to extend the therapy cap exceptions process through December 31, 2017. 
     In February 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was signed into law, which provides for the repeal of all therapy caps retroactively to January 1, 2018. The new law preserves the former therapy cap amounts as thresholds above which claims must include a modifier as a confirmation that services are medically necessary as justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record. The law retained the MMR process for claims over the threshold, but reduced the claim threshold to $3,000. Just as with the incurred expenses for the therapy cap amounts, there is one amount for PT and SLP services combined and a separate amount for OT services. This amount is indexed annually by the Medicare Economic Index.  The modifier threshold amount for both combined SLP and PT services and OT services is $2,080 in 2020 compared to $2,040 in 2019.
     In November 2019, CMS issued the calendar year 2020 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule establishing that therapy assistant claim modifiers will be required starting in calendar year 2020. This rule is consistent with the requirement of the Balanced Budget Act of 2018, which requires a 15% payment reduction when a physical therapist assistant (PTA) or occupational therapy assistant (OTA) provides services “in whole or in part” on a given day. While the modifiers are required to be applied to the claims beginning in calendar year 2020, the 15% therapist assistant payment reduction will not be applied until calendar year 2022. The final rule clarified the meaning of “in whole or in part” to mean when 10% or more of the services are provided by a PTA or OTA.
     The FY 2020 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), indicates that there will be no decrease in PT and OT code payments in 2020. However, CMS also indicated its intent to make changes to reimbursement rates that would become effective January 1, 2021. These changes, if finalized, will effectively lower the reimbursement rate for Medicare Part B specialty providers; specific to our industry, CMS is proposing cuts to Part B therapy services by 8%.

 The Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (MPPR) continues at a 50% reduction, which is applied to therapy procedures by reducing payments for practice expense of the second and subsequent procedures when services provided beyond one unit of one procedure are provided on the same day. The implementation of MPPR includes 1) facilities that provide Medicare Part B SLP, OT, and PT services and bill under the same provider number; and 2) providers in private practice, including speech-language pathologists, who perform and bill for multiple services in a single day.
     Medicare Annual Market Basket
     Current law requires CMS to calculate an annual market basket update to the payment rates. Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) directed the agency to reduce that payment level by a calculated multi-factor productivity adjustment. The agency also retains the authority to review and adjust payments for corrections to previous year market baskets where over/under payment exceeded 0.05% between the projected market basket and the actual performance. Annually, on a federal fiscal year basis (October 1), the agency makes its payment changes. Normally, CMS issues proposed rules during April, providing 60-days for stakeholder input, and issues finalized rules 60 days prior to the start of the fiscal year. If there are no substantive changes in rules and regulations, the agency has the authority to issue rate adjustments in a notice, rather than a proposed rule. The notice must be issued 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.
     On July 31, 2017, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2018 outlining Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities.  The final rule uses a market basket percentage of 1.0% effective October 1, 2017.
     On August 8, 2018, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2019 outlining Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities.  A market basket increase of 2.4% was mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 effective October 1, 2018. Reimbursement for fiscal year 2019 was based on the current payment methodology using the Resource Utilization Group, Version IV (RUG-IV) model with one significant change, the addition of the Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (see below) incentive multiplier.
     On July 30, 2019, CMS released a final rule for skilled nursing facilities prospective payment services (SNF PPS) for fiscal year 2020 Medicare Part A services.  The final rule made revisions from the proposed rule for the PDPM market basket increase and additional modifications to the skilled nursing facility Quality Reporting Program (QRP).  PDPM replaced the existing case-mix classification methodology, RUG-IV, effective October 1, 2019.  The final rule addresses specific issue areas, discussed below, related to the fiscal year 2020 requirements.  
     The final rule provides for a net SNF PPS market basket update factor for skilled nursing facilities of 2.4% effective October 1, 2019.  This is a full market basket update of 2.8% with no forecast error incurred and a 0.4% multifactor productivity adjustment.
     Skilled Nursing Facility - Quality Measures Reporting Program (SNF QRP)
     The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) imposed data reporting requirements for skilled nursing facilities and certain other post-acute care providers in an effort to improve Medicare beneficiary outcomes through shared-decision making, care coordination, and enhanced discharge planning. Beginning with federal fiscal year 2018, skilled nursing facilities that fail to submit required quality data are subject to a 2.0% reduction to the annual market basket update.     Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF-VBP) Program 
     The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required the establishment of a SNF-VBP Program. Effective October 1, 2018, the SNF-VBP Program allowed skilled nursing facilities to earn incentive payments based on the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries, as measured by a specified quality measure related to hospital readmissions. In order to fund the incentive payment pool, CMS withholds 2.0% of Medicare payments and then redistributes 60% of the withheld payments to skilled nursing facilities.  Skilled nursing facilities are evaluated based on both improvement and achievement of their hospital readmission measure. Skilled nursing facilities also receive quarterly confidential feedback reports regarding their performance.  CMS periodically publishes updates regarding the program’s administrative matters, such as scoring methodology.     Sequestration of Medicare Rates 
     The Budget Control Act of 2011 required mandatory reductions in federal spending, known as sequestration.  Sequestration 

 
  10
 
imposed Medicare spending reductions of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2.0% reduction on Medicare FFS payments beginning in April 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2023.     Medicare Advantage Plans 
     Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called Medicare Part C or MA Plans, are offered by private companies that are approved by CMS.  Medicare Advantage Plans cover all Medicare services and manage care of patients through a network of doctors, hospitals and other providers. Reimbursement rates for nursing care are negotiated with the plans and are not set by skilled nursing facility PPS rules of payments. CMS has indicated that Medicare Advantage Plans can determine whether to incorporate any aspects of PDPM into their reimbursement methodology or use other appropriate reimbursement methodologies.     Commercial Insurance
      A different type of insurance, commercial long-term care insurance, is also available to consumers. However, its role as a significant contributor to industry revenues has not been fully realized. Factors contributing to the lack of revenues include high premium costs and intermittent, often significant premium rate increases throughout the life of the policy and denials of coverage.     Private and Other Payors
     Private and other payors consist primarily of self-pay individuals, family members or other third parties who directly pay for the services we provide.
     Reimbursement for our Services
     Reimbursement for Skilled Nursing Facilities
     The majority of skilled nursing facility revenues in the U.S. come from Medicare and Medicaid, with the remainder of revenues derived from managed care and commercial insurance, other third-party sources and private pay.  Typically, all patients that enter a skilled nursing facility begin as a short-term acute care patient and either get discharged or become long-term care residents.  After a patient no longer qualifies for skilled care under Medicare, the reimbursement of costs incurred by a skilled nursing facility patient will be shifted to private pay (out of pocket) resources and then Medicaid if the patient qualifies.    Historically, adjustments to reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid have had a significant effect on our revenue and results of operations.  Recently enacted, pending and proposed legislation and administrative rulemaking at the federal and state levels could have similar effects on our business.  Efforts to impose reduced reimbursement rates, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Reimbursement for Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
     Assisted/senior living facilities generate revenues primarily from private pay sources, including third-party insurance and self-pay, with only a small portion derived from government sources.
     Reimbursement for Rehabilitation Services
     Outside of therapy received during a Medicare Part A covered stay of up to 100 days, most of our rehabilitation therapy services are typically reimbursed under the Medicare Part B program. The payments made to our rehabilitation therapy services segment for services it provides to skilled nursing facilities are determined by negotiated patient per diem rates or a negotiated fee schedule based on the type of service rendered. In addition, this segment is also directly reimbursed from the Medicare Part B program, Medicaid, and other insurance companies through its certified outpatient rehabilitation agencies and group practices for services provided in assisted living facilities, homes and the community.

 Recent Legislative, Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue
     The revenue and operating environment for the post-acute and long-term care services we deliver has been significantly shaped by a series of healthcare laws passed by Congress and implemented by government entities. The broad healthcare reforms enacted as part of PPACA have been among the most significant of revisions. Embedded in this complex legislation were provisions redesigning the private insurance market place, expanding the obligations of Medicaid, empowering changes in Medicare and stimulating innovations in payment and care delivery. The implementation of the provisions of PPACA has shaped the policy landscape. 
     Our operating environment has been further influenced by specific provisions in other legislation, such as:

· | Provisions of PAMA mandated implementation of skilled nursing facilities value-based incentives based on hospital readmission performance; provisions including a 2% payment withholding and redistribution based on performance incentive provisions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provisions of the IMPACT Act established standardized patient assessment and quality performance measures for post-acute providers; provisions which are being implemented through specific regulations and instructions. This legislation mandated studies examining the feasibility of a unified post-acute care payment methodology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provisions of MACRA revised the payment methodology for physician and non-physician professional services stimulating the development of alternative payment models. Included in this legislation was a provision limiting the fiscal year 2018 skilled nursing facility market basket increase to 1%, a provision implemented in the fiscal year 2018 skilled nursing facilities PPS rules.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 that required government agencies to update and annually index civil monetary penalties (CMPs). This provision has been implemented by rule making.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provisions of the Notice of Observation Treatment and Implications for Care Eligibility Act implemented in 2016 requiring hospitals to inform Medicare beneficiaries whether services would qualify for the three-day inpatient requirement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which, among other provisions, repeals effective January 1, 2018 the Medicare Part B Therapy Caps for PT/SLP and OT services. As signed into law, this legislation has provisions restricting the Medicare skilled nursing facilities PPS market basket index for fiscal year 2019 to 2.4%, limits the physician/non-physician fee schedules update for the coming year, and alters payment beginning in 2022 for services provided by therapy assistants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Regulation (MFAR)
     In November 2019, CMS issued a proposed rule, the Medicaid Fiscal Accountability Regulation (MFAR), regarding the use of Medicaid supplemental payment programs and financing arrangements.  The proposed rule could negatively impact Medicaid revenue for our facilities that currently rely upon provider taxes, intergovernmental transfers (IGTs), and upper payment limit (UPL) payments if states fail to meet the new requirements within a two to three year period after the proposed rule is finalized.  The proposed rule clarified certain definitions with respect to these topics and imposed new requirements on certain financing mechanisms. Additionally, MFAR introduced new reporting requirements with respect to Medicaid supplemental payment programs, such as the requirement for states to furnish provider-level data in lieu of aggregated data and the use of an approved template for certain payment demonstration programs. These requirements are intended to allow CMS to better track payments and analyze payment detail.  The proposed rule also clarifies that providers must receive and retain 100 percent of the payment, helping to prevent states and other units of government from reusing Medicaid payments as a source of state financing for additional payments.  Further, existing and new supplemental payment methodologies would be phased out after no more than 3 years and states would be required to request a new CMS approval to continue a supplemental payment beyond the maximum 3 year approved period. Currently, the majority of the states in which we operate could be impacted by the proposed provider tax regulations, which if implemented, would become effective three years after the effective date of the regulation. Additionally, we operate one center in Indiana that could be impacted by the proposed changes in the IGT regulations. The comment period for the proposed rule closed during the first quarter of 2020.     Medicaid Healthy Adult Opportunity (HAO) Demonstration Initiative
     In January 2020, CMS announced an optional demonstration initiative, the Healthy Adult Opportunity (HAO), that would permit states to pursue a capped Medicaid financing model for certain Medicaid populations and the opportunity to share in program savings. The HAO will utilize Section 1115 waiver authority to provide coverage to adults not eligible for benefits under the state’s Medicaid 

 
  12
 
state plan, while offering states increased flexibility in administering the benefits of such individuals. Specifically, the HAO targets adults under age 65 who are not eligible for Medicaid on the basis of disability or their need for long-term care services and supports, and who are not eligible under a state plan. Other very low-income parents, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people eligible on the basis of a disability will not be directly affected – except from the improvements that result from states reinvesting savings into strengthening their overall programs. Under this initiative, states may implement an “aggregate” (commonly referred to as a “block grant”) or per capita cap financing model.  The HAO demonstrations generally will be approved for an initial five-year period from the date of implementation, and successful demonstrations may be renewed for a period of up to 10 years.
     Skilled Nursing Facilities
     Healthcare Reform Initiatives
     We believe we have positioned our business and operations for success in a healthcare environment that rewards quality outcomes as opposed to volume of services provided.  We believe that post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals and payors and operate with scale will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  We believe our business strategies should position us to become a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay and hospital readmissions, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models. As the industry and its regulators continue to engage in this environment, we will continue to adapt to changes that are ultimately made to the delivery system. For example, several of our skilled nursing facilities successfully participated in the CMS Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) demonstration, which encouraged coordination of care amongst providers for certain episodes of care. The latest demonstration term for the program expired on September 30, 2018.  We are not participating in the new BPCI Advanced model, which commenced October 1, 2018, as it precludes post-acute providers from participating in a manner similar to the original program.  Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)
 The Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) is an alternative payment model created by CMS that moves the payment system towards a more value-based model through the promotion of accountability for a patient population, coordination of care for Medicare beneficiaries, and encouragement of investment in high quality and efficient services. Under MSSP, providers and suppliers are able to create an ACO, which in turn agrees to be held accountable for the quality, cost, and experience of care of an assigned Medicare FFS beneficiary population. MSSP has various risk-sharing tracks that allow ACOs to select an arrangement. Participation in the program grants certain advantages to ACOs. For example, eligible ACOs may apply for a waiver to the 3-day qualifying stay rule.
     Effective January 1, 2016, LTC ACO, LLC (formerly known as Genesis Healthcare ACO, LLC) began participating in MSSP through our physician services division.  Successful participation requires us to carefully document delivery, meet specific performance criteria and meet specific savings targets. Our physician services providers make more than half a million visits annually to both short- and long-stay patients, helping them improve overall healthcare quality and reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.  As of December 2019, LTC ACO had contracted with nearly 200 new unaffiliated long-term care facilities. LTC ACO has plans to significantly expand its resident attribution beginning in 2020, not only inside Genesis but also more broadly throughout the skilled nursing industry.        2019 Performance Year
 Effective July 1, 2019, we entered into a new MSSP agreement with CMS, which is scheduled to remain in effect through December 31, 2024. Under this agreement, we can share in up to 75% of the savings with CMS, but we are also at risk for 40% of any costs in excess of CMS-defined targets, which is further capped at 15% of our annualized benchmark costs under management. For the first half of 2019, we operated under our initial MSSP agreement, which allowed us to share in up to 50% of the savings with CMS, while assuming no downside risk.
 With four years of participation under MSSP, we have gained valuable experience driving better outcomes and improved quality, managing episodic cost and developing in-house capabilities to predict program performance.  Based upon the data available to us with respect to the 2019 performance year, we have recognized $6.6 million of cumulative MSSP income, net of expenses and provider distributions.  The final reconciliation and settlement of the 2019 performance year is expected to be received from CMS in the third quarter of 2020.  We will continue to closely monitor and evaluate our estimated performance under the 2019 performance year and will adjust our MSSP income accordingly.

 
  13
 

 Past Performance Years
 During 2018 and the first half of 2019, we managed, under an upside-only risk track, approximately 6,400 and 6,000, respectively, Medicare FFS beneficiaries under MSSP with annualized Medicare spend of more than $155.0 million.  In August 2019, we were informed by CMS that we reached the minimum savings rate set by CMS required for MSSP gain share for 2018.  As a result, in the third quarter of 2019, we recognized MSSP income of approximately $1.7 million, net of expenses and provider distributions.  We did not generate savings in the 2017 performance year, and in the 2016 performance year, we generated savings, but did not achieve the minimum savings target and therefore, did not share in any of the savings. Government Regulation
 General
 Healthcare is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant impact on our methods and costs of doing business.  Our subsidiaries that provide healthcare services are subject to federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, licensure, delivery, quality and adequacy of care, physical plant requirements, life safety, personnel and operating policies.  In addition, our provider subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws that govern billing and reimbursement, relationships with vendors and business relationships with physicians.  Such laws include, but are not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statue, the federal False Claims Act (FCA), the Stark Law and state corporate practice of medicine statutes.
 Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and outpatient rehabilitation agencies to verify that we continue to comply with the applicable regulations and standards. We must pass these inspections to remain licensed under state laws, to comply with our Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements, and, in some instances, to continue our participation in the Veterans Administration program. We can only participate in these third-party payment programs if inspections by regulatory authorities reveal that our facilities and agencies are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements. In the ordinary course of business, we may receive notices from federal or state regulatory authorities alleging deficiencies in certain regulatory practices. These statements of deficiency may require us to take corrective action to regain and maintain compliance.  In some cases, federal or state regulators may impose other remedies including imposition of CMPs, temporary payment bans, loss of certification as a provider in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program or revocation of a state operating license. 
 We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry subjects providers to intense scrutiny. In the ordinary course of business, providers are subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies related to compliance with participation and payment rules under government payment programs. These inquiries may originate from the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits, state Medicaid agencies, local and state ombudsman offices and CMS Recovery Audit Contractors, among other agencies.  In response to the inquiries, investigations and audits, the federal and state governments continue to impose citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory penalties, including demands for refund of overpayments, expanded CMPs that extend over long periods of time and date back to incidents long before surveyor visits, Medicare and Medicaid payment bans and terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We vigorously contest these matters where appropriate; however, there are significant legal and other expenses involved that consume our financial and personnel resources. Expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business, financial condition or the results of our operations. 
 Five-Star Quality Rating
     In 2008, CMS created the Five-Star Quality Rating System (the Star Ratings) to help consumers, families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities and choose providers more easily.  Skilled nursing facilities receive an overall star rating from one to five stars based on three components: health inspection rating (survey results), quality measure calculations and staffing data. Each of the components receives star rankings as well. Skilled nursing facilities with five stars are considered to have much above average quality and skilled nursing facilities with one star are considered to have quality much below average. Families are increasingly consulting the Star Ratings prior to placing a family member in a skilled nursing facility and hospital referral partners are increasingly narrowing their panels of skilled nursing facilities to include only those with at least a three-star overall rating. However, CMS has acknowledged that there are limitations in using the Star Ratings to make inferences about nursing center quality, including (i) variations by state in survey processes, (ii) the use of payroll based data that may not fully reflect actual staffing patterns and (iii) quality measures do not represent all aspects of care that could be important to consumers.  The foundation of the Star Ratings is the annual survey.
    
 
  14
 

 In April 2016, CMS added six quality measures to the Nursing Home Compare website. These quality measures include:  successful discharges to the community; visits to the emergency department; rehospitalizations; improvements in function; long-stay residents whose ability to move independently worsened; and antianxiety or hypnotic medications.  Five quality measures were used to compute Star Ratings in July 2016 (antianxiety or hypnotic medications were excluded).  Starting in January 2017, the five quality measures have the same weight as the other quality measures.  This change was the largest addition of quality measures to Nursing Home Compare since 2003 and nearly doubles the number of short-stay measures about key short-stay outcomes. Short-stay measures reflect care provided to residents who are in the nursing home for 100 days or less, while long-stay measures reflect care for residents who are in the nursing home for more than 100 days.  The health inspection star rating for surveys was frozen in February 2018 and did not reflect surveys conducted between November 28, 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. This freeze was in anticipation of the phase 2 implementation of the Requirements of Participation on the same date, as well as the implementation of the new Long-Term Care Survey Process. CMS notified providers that all surveys conducted during the freeze would be incorporated into the health inspection star.
     In April 2019, CMS implemented changes to the Five-Star Quality Rating System. These changes included a lifting of the freeze, revisions to the inspection process, adjustment of staffing rating thresholds, including increased emphasis on registered nurse staffing, implementation of new quality measures and changes in the scoring of various quality measures. CMS added two new quality measures: long-stay emergency department transfers and long-stay hospitalizations. CMS also established separate quality ratings for short-stay and long-stay residents and will now provide separate short-stay and long-stay ratings in addition to the overall quality measure rating.
     The impact of the most recent five star rating methodology was significant across the industry. CMS initially estimated the changes would cause 47% of all nursing centers to lose stars in their "Quality" ratings. In addition, 33% would lose stars in their "Staffing" ratings, and 36% would lose stars in their "Overall" ratings. Accordingly, despite no significant changes in our staffing levels or quality of our care, these changes to the staffing and quality thresholds had a negative impact on our star rating in 2019.
 The table below summarizes the Star Ratings of our qualified skilled nursing facilities:

 | Year ended December 31, | 
 | 2019 | 2018 | 
Number of skilled nursing facilities | | 355 | | 393 | 
Number of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 193 | | 251 | 
Percentage of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 54 | % | 64 | %

      Payroll-Based Journal
 One of the CMS initiatives authorized by the PPACA was to improve the accuracy of nursing home staffing data. CMS initiated and rolled-out an electronic payroll-based journal (PBJ) requirement effective July 1, 2016. This system allows staffing and census information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than previously collected. It is also auditable to ensure accuracy.  All long-term care facilities have access to this system at no cost to facilities. Effective January 2018, the Staffing Star component of 5 star is calculated using the data collected from PBJ coupled with MDS data. 
     Requirements of Participation
     In October 2016, CMS published a final rule to make major changes to improve the care and safety of residents in long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The policies in this final rule are targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care, and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities.
     Changes finalized in this rule include:

· | Strengthening the rights of long-term care facility residents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that long-term care facility staff members are properly trained on caring for residents with dementia and in preventing elder abuse.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that long-term care facilities take into consideration the health of residents when making decisions on the kinds and levels of staffing a facility needs to properly take care of its residents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that staff members have the right skill sets and competencies to provide person-centered care to residents. The care plans developed for residents will take into consideration their goals of care and preferences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  15
 


· | Improving care planning, including discharge planning for all residents with involvement of the facility’s interdisciplinary team and consideration of the caregiver’s capacity, giving residents information they need for follow-up after discharge, and ensuring that instructions are transmitted to any receiving facilities or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Updating the long-term care facility’s infection prevention and control program, including requiring an infection prevention and control officer and an antibiotic stewardship program that includes antibiotic use protocols and a system to monitor antibiotic use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The new requirements were implemented in three phases. The regulations included in the first phase were effective November 28, 2016; the regulations included in the second phase were effective November 28, 2017; the regulations included in third phase were effective November 28, 2019, despite recent proposals to delay implementation of certain aspects of the rule.  The total costs associated with implementing the new regulations have been absorbed into our general operating costs.  Failure to comply with the new regulations could result in exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have timely implemented the changes required under the three phases, in all material respects. In July 2019, CMS proposed revisions to the requirements of participation, which if finalized, would result in the removal or simplification of certain requirements that could potentially impede or divert resources away from the provision of high-quality resident care, thus increasing facilities’ ability to devote their resources to improving resident care.
 Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws and Enforcement
 Federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulate both the provision of services to government program beneficiaries and the methods and requirements for submitting claims for services rendered to such beneficiaries. Under these laws, individuals and organizations can be penalized for submitting claims for services that are not provided; that have been inadequately provided; billed in an incorrect manner, intentionally or accidentally, or other than as actually provided; not medically necessary; provided by an improper person; accompanied by an illegal inducement to utilize or refrain from utilizing a service or product; or billed or coded in a manner that does not otherwise comply with applicable governmental requirements. Penalties also may be imposed for violation of anti-kickback and patient referral laws.
 Federal and state governments have a range of criminal, civil and administrative sanctions available to penalize and remediate healthcare fraud and abuse, including exclusion of the provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, imposition of civil and criminal fines, suspension of payments and, in the case of individuals, imprisonment.
 We have internal policies and procedures, including a program designed to facilitate compliance with and to reduce exposure for violations of these and other laws and regulations. However, because enforcement efforts presently are widespread within the industry and may vary from region to region, there can be no assurance that our internal policies and procedures will significantly reduce or eliminate exposure to civil or criminal sanctions or adverse administrative determinations.
 Anti-Kickback Statute
 Federal law commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of anything of value, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony, and sanctions for each violation include imprisonment of up to five years, significant criminal fines, significant CMPs plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Additionally, violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA.  Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to induce referrals applicable to all payors.
 We are required under the Medicare Requirements of Participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and hospice agencies and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our residents and patients. In addition, we have contracts with other suppliers, including pharmacies, laboratories, x-ray companies, ambulance services and medical equipment companies. Some of these individuals or entities may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to us, and we may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to these individuals or entities. Certain safe harbor provisions have been created so that although a relationship could potentially implicate the federal anti-kickback statute, it would not be treated as an offense under the statute. We attempt to structure these arrangements in a manner that falls within one of the safe harbors. Some of these arrangements may not ultimately satisfy the applicable safe harbor requirements, but failure to meet the safe harbor does not necessarily mean an arrangement is illegal.

 We believe that our arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, if any of our arrangements with third parties were to be challenged and found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be required to repay any amounts we received, subject to criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Stark Law
 Federal law commonly known as the Stark Law prohibits a physician from making referrals for particular healthcare services to entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member of the physician) has a financial relationship if the services are payable by Medicare or Medicaid. If an arrangement is covered by the Stark Law, the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met for the physician to be able to make referrals to the entity for designated health services and for the entity to be able to bill for these services. Although the term “designated health services” does not include long-term care services, some of the services provided at our skilled nursing facilities and other related business units are classified as designated health services, including PT, SLP and OT services. The term “financial relationship” is defined very broadly to include most types of ownership or compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment from the patient or the Medicare and Medicaid programs for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral.
 The Stark Law contains exceptions for certain physician ownership or investment interests in, and certain physician compensation arrangements with, certain entities. If a compensation arrangement or investment relationship between a physician, or immediate family member, and an entity satisfies the applicable requirements for a Stark Law exception, the Stark Law will not prohibit the physician from referring patients to the entity for designated health services. The exceptions for compensation arrangements cover employment relationships, personal services contracts and space and equipment leases, among others.
 If an entity violates the Stark Law, it could be subject to significant civil penalties. The entity also may be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. If the Stark Law were found to apply to our relationships with referring physicians and no exception under the Stark Law were available, we would be required to restructure these relationships or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from these physicians. If we were found to have submitted claims to Medicare or Medicaid for services provided pursuant to a referral prohibited by the Stark Law, we would be required to repay any amounts we received from Medicare or Medicaid for those services and could be subject to CMPs. Further, we could be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we were required to repay any amounts to Medicare or Medicaid, subjected to fines, or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed significantly.
 As directed by PPACA, in 2010 CMS released a self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) for potential or actual violations of the Stark Law. Under SRDP, CMS states that it may, but is not required to, reduce the amounts due and owing for a Stark Law violation, and will consider the following factors in deciding whether to grant a reduction: (1) the nature and extent of the improper or illegal practice; (2) the timeliness of the self-disclosure; (3) the cooperation in providing additional information related to the disclosure; (4) the litigation risk associated with the matter disclosed; and (5) the financial position of the disclosing party.
 Many states have physician relationship and referral statutes that are similar to the Stark Law. These laws generally apply regardless of the payor. We believe that our operations are structured to comply with the Stark Law and applicable state laws with respect to physician relationships and referrals. However, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties. This, in turn, could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 False Claims Act
 Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false claims and other acts that are considered fraudulent, wasteful or abusive. Under the federal FCA, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, who are often referred to as “qui tam relators” or “relators,” are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years. The use of private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically, in part because the relators are entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment.
 An FCA violation occurs when a provider knowingly submits a claim for items or services not provided.  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by creating liability for knowingly retaining an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The submission of false claims or the failure to timely repay 

 
  17
 
overpayments may lead to the imposition of significant CMPs, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Allegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services.  Worthless services cases allege that although care was provided it was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all.    
 In recent years, prosecutors and relators are increasingly bringing FCA claims based on the implied certification theory as an expansion of the scope of the FCA.  Under the implied certification theory, a violation of the FCA occurs when a provider’s request for payment implies a certification of compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment.  This development has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from the federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims.
 Because we submit thousands of claims to Medicare each year, and there is a relatively long statute of limitations under the FCA, there is a risk that intentional, or even negligent or recklessly submitted claims that prove to be incorrect, or even billing errors, cost reporting errors or lapses in statutory or regulatory compliance with regard to the provision of healthcare services (including, without limitation the Anti-Kickback Statue and the federal self-referral law discussed above), could result in significant civil or criminal penalties against us.  For information regarding matters in which the government is pursuing, or has expressed an intent to pursue, legal remedies against us under the FCA and similar state laws, see Note 21 – "Commitment and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings." 
 We believe that our operations comply with the FCA and similar state laws. However, if our claims practices were challenged and found to violate the applicable laws, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties or make us ineligible to participate in certain government funded healthcare programs, which could in turn significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Patient Privacy and Security Laws
 There are numerous legislative and regulatory requirements at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security of health information.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) contains provisions that require us to adopt and maintain business procedures designed to protect the privacy, security and integrity of patients' individual health information.  States also have laws that apply to the privacy of healthcare information. We must comply with these state privacy laws to the extent that they are more protective of healthcare information or provide additional protections not afforded by HIPAA.
 HIPAA's security standards were designed to protect specified information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and to protect the information against unauthorized use or disclosure.  These standards have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry because they impose extensive requirements and restrictions on the use and disclosure of identifiable patient information.  In addition, HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information.
 The Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act) expanded the requirements and noncompliance penalties under HIPAA and require correspondingly intensive compliance efforts by companies such as ours, including self-disclosures of breaches of unsecured health information to affected patients, federal officials, and, in some cases, the media.  These laws make unauthorized employee access illegal and subject to self-disclosure and penalties.  Other states may adopt similar or more extensive breach notice and privacy requirements. Compliance with these regulations could require us to make significant investments of money and other resources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable state and federal regulations relating to privacy and security of patient information.  However, if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations, we could be subject to significant penalties and other adverse consequences.
 Certificates of Need (CON) and Other Regulatory Matters
 There are CON programs in the majority of states and the District of Columbia, many of which are states in which we operate skilled nursing facilities.  We are required in these jurisdictions to obtain CON approval or exemption prior to certain changes including without limitation, change in ownership, capital expenditures over certain limits, development of a new facility or expansion of services of an existing facility or service in order to control overdevelopment of healthcare projects. Certain states that do not have CON programs may have other laws or regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare projects. In the event we choose to develop or expand the operations of our subsidiaries, the development or expansion could be affected adversely by the inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to such approvals or possible delays and expenses 

 
  18
 
associated with obtaining such approvals.  Failure to comply with state requirements with CON or other regulations that address development or expansion of services could adversely affect the progress or completion of a healthcare project.
 State Operating License Requirements
 We are required to obtain state licenses, certificates or permits to operate each of our skilled nursing facilities. Many states require similar licenses or certificates for assisted/senior living facilities, and some states require a license to operate outpatient agencies. Medicare requires compliance with applicable state laws as a requirement of participation.  In addition, healthcare professionals and practitioners are required to be licensed in most states. We take measures to ensure that our healthcare professionals are properly licensed and participate in required continuing education programs. We believe that our operating companies and personnel that provide these services have required licenses or certifications necessary for our current operations. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew a required license, permit or certification could adversely affect our ability to bill for services or operate in the ordinary course of business.      Federal Health Care Reform
 In addition to the matters described above affecting Medicare and Medicaid participating providers, PPACA enacted several reforms with respect to skilled nursing facilities, including payment measures to realize significant savings of federal and state funds by deterring and prosecuting fraud and abuse in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While many of the provisions of PPACA will not take effect for several years or are subject to further refinement through the promulgation of regulations, some key provisions of PPACA are presently effective.
· | Expanded CMPs and Escrow Provisions. PPACA includes expanded CMP and related provisions applicable to all Medicare and Medicaid providers. CMS rules adopted to implement applicable provisions of PPACA also provide that assessed CMPs may be collected and placed in whole or in part into an escrow account pending final disposition of the applicable administrative and judicial appeals processes. To the extent our businesses are assessed large CMPs that are collected and placed into an escrow account pending lengthy appeals, such actions could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nursing Home Transparency Requirements. In addition to expanded CMP provisions, PPACA imposes new transparency requirements for Medicare-participating nursing facilities. In addition to previously required disclosures regarding a facility's owners, management and secured creditors, PPACA expanded the required disclosures to include information regarding the facility's organizational structure, additional information on officers, directors, trustees and "managing employees" of the facility (including their names, titles, and start dates of services), and information regarding certain parties affiliated with the facility. The transparency provisions could result in the potential for greater government scrutiny and oversight of the ownership and investment structure for skilled nursing facilities, as well as more extensive disclosure of entities and individuals that comprise part of skilled nursing facilities' ownership and management structure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Suspension of Payments During Pending Fraud Investigations. PPACA provides the federal government with expanded authority to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments if a provider is investigated for allegations or issues of fraud. This suspension authority creates a new mechanism for the federal government to suspend both Medicare and Medicaid payments for allegations of fraud, independent of whether a state exercises its authority to suspend Medicaid payments pending a fraud investigation. To the extent the suspension of payments provision is applied to one of our businesses for allegations of fraud, such a suspension could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overpayment Reporting and Repayment; Expanded False Claims Act Liability. PPACA enacted several important changes that expand potential liability under the federal FCA. Overpayments related to services provided to both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries must be reported and returned to the applicable payor within specified deadlines, or else they are considered obligations of the provider for purposes of the federal FCA. This new provision substantially tightens the repayment and reporting requirements generally associated with operations of healthcare providers to avoid FCA exposure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home- and Community-Based Services. PPACA provides that states can provide home- and community-based attendant services and supports through the Community First Choice State plan option. States choosing to provide home- and community-based services under this option must make such services available to assist with activities of daily living and health related tasks under a plan of care agreed upon by the individual and his/her representative. PPACA also includes additional measures related to the expansion of home- and community-based services and authorizes states to expand coverage of home- and community-based services to individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for them. The expansion of home- and community-based services could reduce the demand for the facility-based services that we provide.

· | Health Care-Acquired Conditions. PPACA provides that the Secretary of HHS must prohibit payments to states for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for certain medical conditions acquired during the patient's receipt of healthcare services. The CMS regulation implementing this provision of PPACA prohibits states from making payments to providers under the Medicaid program for conditions that are deemed to be reasonably preventable. It uses Medicare's list of preventable conditions in inpatient hospital settings as the base (adjusted for the differences in the Medicare and Medicaid populations) and provides states the flexibility to identify additional preventable conditions and settings for which Medicaid payment will be denied.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The provisions of PPACA discussed above are examples of recently enacted federal health reform provisions that we believe may have a material impact on the long-term care industry generally and on our business. However, the foregoing discussion is not intended to constitute, nor does it constitute, an exhaustive review and discussion of PPACA. It is possible that other provisions of PPACA may be interpreted, clarified, or applied to our businesses in a way that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similar federal and/or state legislation that may be adopted in the future could have similar effects.
     Insurance and Related Risks
 We maintain a variety of types of insurance, including general and professional liability, workers' compensation, fiduciary liability, property, cyber/privacy liability, directors' and officers' liability, crime, boiler and machinery, automobile liability, employment practices liability and earthquake and flood. We believe that our insurance programs are adequate and where there has been a direct transfer of risk to the insurance carrier, our risk is limited to the cost of the premium. We self-insure a significant portion of our potential liabilities for several risks, including certain types of general and professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile liability and health benefits. To the extent our insurance coverage is insufficient or unavailable to cover losses that would otherwise be insurable, or to the extent that our estimates of anticipated liabilities that we self-insure are significantly lower than the actual self-insured liabilities that we incur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  For additional information regarding our insurance programs, see Note 21 – “Commitments and Contingencies – Loss Reserves for Certain Self-Insured Programs,” in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 We have developed a risk management program intended to control our insurance and professional liability costs.  As part of this program, we have implemented an arbitration agreement program at each of our nursing facilities under which, upon admission and to the extent permitted under existing regulations, patients are requested (but not required) to execute an agreement that requires disputes to be arbitrated instead of litigated in court. We believe that this program accelerates resolution of disputes and reduces our liability exposure and related costs. We have also established an incident reporting process that involves the provision of tracking and trending data to our facility administrators for purposes of quality assurance and improvement. We apply an enterprise risk management program to continually evaluate risks and opportunities impacting the business. 
     Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. As a healthcare provider, we face regulatory requirements in areas of air and water quality control, medical and low-level radioactive waste management and disposal, asbestos management, response to mold and lead-based paint in our facilities and employee safety.
 In our role as owner of subsidiaries which operate our facilities (including our leased facilities), we also may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances that are located on the property, including any such substances that may have migrated off, or discharged or transported from the property. Part of our operations involves the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and/or discharge of hazardous, infectious, toxic, flammable and other hazardous materials, wastes, pollutants or contaminants. These activities may result in damage to individuals, property or the environment; may interrupt operations and/or increase costs; may result in legal liability, damages, injunctions or fines; may result in investigations, administrative proceedings, penalties or other governmental agency actions; and may not be covered by insurance. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities in the future, and such liabilities may result in material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.
