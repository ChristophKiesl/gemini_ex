ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
General
Hanger, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading national provider of products and services that assist in enhancing or restoring the physical capabilities of patients with disabilities or injuries, and we and our predecessor companies have provided orthotic and prosthetic (“O&P”) services for nearly 160 years. We provide O&P services, distribute O&P devices and components, manage O&P networks, and provide therapeutic solutions to patients and businesses in acute, post-acute, and clinic settings. We operate through two segments - Patient Care and Products & Services.
Our Patient Care segment is primarily comprised of Hanger Clinic, which specializes in the design, fabrication, and delivery of custom O&P devices through 704 patient care clinics and 112 satellite locations in 46 states and the District of Columbia, as of December 31, 2020. We also provide payor network contracting services to other O&P providers through this segment.
Our Products & Services segment is comprised of our distribution services and therapeutic solutions businesses. As a leading provider of O&P products in the United States, we engage in the distribution of a broad catalog of O&P parts, componentry, and devices to independent O&P providers nationwide. The other business in our Products & Services segment is our therapeutic solutions business, which develops specialized rehabilitation technologies and provides evidence-based clinical programs for post-acute rehabilitation to patients at approximately 4,000 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our net revenues were $1,001.2 million, $1,098.0 million, and $1,048.8 million, respectively. We recorded net income of $38.2 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a net loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table summarizes the percentage of net revenues derived from each of our two operating segments:

Industry Overview
We estimate that approximately $4.3 billion is spent in the United States each year for prescription-based O&P products and services through O&P clinics. Orthotic devices, or “orthoses,” are externally applied devices used to modify the structural and functional characteristics of the neuromuscular and skeletal system. These devices typically are provided to patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders, such as ailments of the back, extremities, or joints; injuries from sports; or conditions such as cerebral palsy, scoliosis, and stroke. Prosthetic devices, or “prostheses,” are artificial devices that replace a missing limb or portion of a limb. These devices are provided to patients with amputated or congenitally absent limbs to replace the function and appearance of a limb so that patients can resume activities of daily living and work. The most prevalent causes for amputations are from complications due to diabetes, trauma associated with accidents, physical injury, or infection.
The industry derives its primary revenue from the evaluation, fabrication, and fitting of custom O&P devices to serve patients needing both new and replacement devices. Additionally, O&P clinics typically provide patients with other non-custom orthotic products, diabetic shoes and inserts, and support patients through the repair and adjustment of their devices.

We believe our Patient Care segment currently accounts for approximately 21% of the market, providing a comprehensive portfolio of orthotic, prosthetic, and post-operative solutions to patients in acute, post-acute, and patient care clinic settings. We estimate that the next largest provider of O&P services in the United States is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the “VA”), which operates 79 O&P clinics on behalf of its covered veteran patients. In addition to serving veterans through their own facilities, in certain markets the VA is also a client of Hanger Clinic. Approximately 9% of Hanger Clinic’s revenue is derived from services provided to veteran patients through contracts with the VA.
The O&P patient care services market in the United States is highly fragmented and is characterized by regional and local independent O&P businesses operated predominantly by independent operators, but also including two O&P product manufacturers with substantial international patient care services operations. We estimate that our top ten competitors have an average of approximately 37 clinics each, with the smallest having 22 and the largest having 69 clinics. The remainder of the market is served by individual practitioners and smaller regional or market-based firms with approximately twenty or fewer clinics. Based on this, we do not believe that any single competitor accounts for 2% or more of the nation’s total estimated O&P clinic revenues.
The industry is characterized by stable, recurring revenues, primarily resulting from new patients as well as the need for periodic replacement and modification of O&P devices. We anticipate that the demand for O&P services will continue to grow as the nation’s population increases, and as a result of several trends, including the aging of the U.S. population, there will be an increase in the prevalence of disease-related disability and the demand for new and advanced devices. We believe the typical replacement time for prosthetic devices is three to five years, while the typical replacement time for orthotic devices varies, depending on the device.
We estimate that approximately $1.8 billion is spent in the United States each year by providers of O&P patient care services for the O&P products, components, devices, and supplies used in their businesses. Our Products & Services segment distributes to independent providers of O&P services. We estimate that our distribution sales account for approximately 9% of the market for O&P products, components, devices, and supplies (excluding sales to our Patient Care segment).
We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, integrated clinical programs, and clinician training in skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) to be approximately $150 million annually. We currently provide these products and services to approximately 25% of the estimated 15,000 SNFs located in the U.S. We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, clinical programs, and training within the broader post-acute rehabilitation markets to be approximately $400 million annually. We do not currently provide a meaningful amount of products and services to this broader market.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be the provider of choice for patients, referring physicians, and customers seeking products and services that enhance human physical capabilities. Our strategy is to pursue the creation of an integrated therapeutic solutions model that will have a strong focus in custom O&P and immediately adjacent markets to provide our patients and customers with a spectrum of services that address their individual needs. To foster growth, we intend to focus on initiatives that will differentiate Hanger from our competitors.
Government-led health care reform is driving significant changes to our business environment, with focus on lowering health care costs while improving patient outcomes and satisfaction. As a result, our strategy is focused on enhancing the quality of care to elevate patient satisfaction, investing in processes and technologies to measure and report on patient outcomes and connectedness, and further increasing our profile with referring health care providers and payors. In addition, we are committed to reducing the cost of this care by undertaking several initiatives that include establishing device standards that provide the highest function, durability, and comfort at the lowest cost, reconfiguring our supply chain and fabrication processes, streamlining internal administrative processes, and reducing back-office functions performed within patient care clinics.

Business Description
Patient Care
Our Patient Care segment employs approximately 1,600 clinical prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists, which we refer to as clinicians, substantially all of which are certified by either the American Board for Certification (“ABC”) or the Board of Certification of Orthotists and Prosthetists, which are the two boards that certify O&P clinicians. To facilitate timely service to our patients, we also employ technicians, fitters, and other ancillary providers to assist our clinicians in the performance of their duties. Through this segment, we additionally provide network contracting services to independent providers of O&P.
Patients are typically referred to Hanger Clinic by an attending physician who determines a patient’s treatment and writes a prescription. Our clinicians then consult with both the referring physician and the patient with a view toward assisting in the selection of an orthotic or prosthetic device to meet the patient’s needs. O&P devices are increasingly technologically advanced and custom designed to add functionality and comfort to patients’ lives, shorten the rehabilitation process, and lower the cost of rehabilitation.
Based on the prescription written by a referring physician, our clinicians examine and evaluate the patient and either design a custom device or, in the case of certain orthotic needs, utilize a non-custom device, including, in appropriate circumstances, an “off the shelf” device, to address the patient’s needs. When fabricating a device, our clinicians ascertain the specific requirements, componentry, and measurements necessary for the construction of the device. Custom devices are constructed using componentry provided by a variety of third party manufacturers that specialize in O&P, coupled with sockets and other elements that are fabricated by our clinicians and technicians, to meet the individual patient’s physical and ambulatory needs. Our clinicians and technicians typically utilize castings, electronic scans, and other techniques to fabricate items that are specialized for the patient. After fabricating the device, a fitting process is undertaken and adjustments are made to ensure the achievement of proper alignment, fit, and patient comfort. The fitting process often involves several stages to successfully achieve desired functional and cosmetic results.
Given the differing physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic, and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prosthesis and orthosis is customized for each particular patient. These custom devices are commonly fabricated at one of our regional or national fabrication facilities.
We have earned a reputation within the O&P industry for the development and use of innovative technology in our products, which has increased patient comfort and capability and can significantly enhance the rehabilitation process. We utilize multiple scanning and imaging technologies in the fabrication process, depending on the patient’s individual needs, including our proprietary Insignia scanning system. The Insignia system scans the patient and produces an accurate computer-generated image, resulting in a faster turnaround for the patient’s device and a more professional overall experience.
In recent years, we have established a centralized revenue cycle management organization that assists our clinics in pre-authorization, patient eligibility, denial management, collections, payor audit coordination, and other accounts receivable processes.
The principal reimbursement sources for our services are:

● | Commercial private payors and other non-governmental organizations, which consist of individuals, rehabilitation providers, commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), hospitals, vocational rehabilitation centers, workers’ compensation programs, third party administrators, and similar sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medicare, a federally funded health insurance program providing health insurance coverage for persons aged 65 or older and certain persons with disabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medicaid, a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments providing health insurance coverage for certain persons requiring financial assistance, regardless of age, which may supplement Medicare benefits for persons aged 65 or older requiring financial assistance; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the VA.

We typically enter into contracts with third party payors that allow us to perform O&P services for a referred patient and to be reimbursed for our services. These contracts usually have a stated term of one to three years and generally may be terminated without cause by either party on 60 to 90 days’ notice, or on 30 days’ notice if we have not complied with certain licensing, certification, program standards, Medicare or Medicaid requirements, or other regulatory requirements. Reimbursement for services is typically based on a fee schedule negotiated with the third party payor that reflects various factors, including market conditions, geographic area, and number of persons covered. Many of our commercial contracts are indexed to the commensurate Medicare fee schedule that relates to the products or services being provided.
Government reimbursement, comprised of Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately, 57.7%, 57.5%, and 56.5% of our net revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These payors set maximum reimbursement levels for O&P services and products. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The CPI-U is adjusted further by an efficiency factor known as the “Productivity Adjustment” or the “Multi-Factor Productivity Adjustment” in order to determine the final rate adjustment each year. The Medicare price adjustments for 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were 0. 2%, 0.9%, 2.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. There can be no assurance that future adjustments will not reduce reimbursements for O&P services and products from these sources.
We, and the O&P industry in general, are subject to various Medicare compliance audits, including Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) audits, Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (“CERT”) audits, Targeted Probe and Educate (“TPE”) audits, Supplemental Medical Review Contractor (“SMRC”) audits, and Unified Program Integrity Contractor (“UPIC”) audits. TPE audits are generally pre-payment audits, while RAC, CERT, and SMRC audits are generally post-payment audits. UPIC audits can be both pre- or post-payment audits, with a majority currently pre-payment. TPE audits replaced the previous Medicare Administrative Contractor audits. Adverse post-payment audit determinations generally require Hanger to reimburse Medicare for payments previously made, while adverse pre-payment audit determinations generally result in the denial of payment. In either case, we can request a redetermination or appeal, if we believe the adverse determination is unwarranted, which can take an extensive period of time to resolve, currently up to six years or more.
Products & Services
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Prosthetic Supply, Inc. (“SPS”), we distribute O&P components to independent O&P clinics and other customers. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accelerated Care Plus Corp. (“ACP”), our therapeutic solutions business is a leading provider of rehabilitation technologies and integrated clinical programs to skilled nursing and post-acute rehabilitation providers. Our value proposition is to provide our customers with a full-service “total solutions” approach encompassing proven medical technology, evidence-based clinical programs, and ongoing consultative education and training. Our services support increasingly advanced treatment options for a broader patient population and more medically complex conditions. We currently serve approximately 4,000 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide. Through our SureFit subsidiary, we also manufacture and sell therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients in the podiatric market. We also operate the Hanger Fabrication Network, which fabricates custom O&P devices for our patient care clinics, as well as for independent O&P clinics.
Through our internal “supply chain” organization, we purchase, warehouse, and distribute over 475,000 SKUs from more than 300 different manufacturers through SPS or directly to our own clinics within our Patient Care segment. Our warehousing and distribution facilities in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, and Texas provide us with the ability to deliver products to the vast majority of our customers in the United States within two business days. The distribution facility we formerly operated in Pennsylvania ceased operations in September 2020.
Our supply chain organization enables us to:

● | centralize our purchasing and thus lower our material costs by negotiating purchasing discounts from manufacturers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | better manage our patient care clinic inventory levels and improve inventory turns;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve inventory quality control;
--+-----------------------------------


● | encourage our patient care clinics to use the most clinically appropriate products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | coordinate new product development efforts with key vendors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning in the last two weeks of March 2020, our business volumes began to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As federal, state, and local authorities implemented social distancing and suppression measures to respond to an increasing number of nationwide COVID-19 infections, we experienced a decrease in our patient appointments and general business volumes. In response, during the last week of March 2020, we made certain changes to our operations, implemented a broad number of cost reduction measures, and delayed certain capital investment projects. Although our business volumes have shown gradual improvement from their initial significant decline, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continued into the fourth quarter of 2020 and beyond. These volume effects, our operating responses, and the effects of COVID-19 on our financial condition are discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” sections below.
Competition
The business of providing O&P patient care services is highly competitive in the markets in which we operate. In the prosthetic business, we compete with regional and local O&P providers for referrals from physicians, therapists, employers, HMOs, PPOs, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, out-patient clinics, and insurance companies on both a local and regional basis. In the orthotic business, we compete with other patient care service providers, including device manufacturers that have independent sales forces, on the basis of quality and timeliness of patient care, location of patient care clinics, and pricing for services. Additionally, two international O&P product manufacturers each own regional and local O&P patient care services business in the United States.
Although we serve a significant portion of the O&P patient care market, referral decisions made by surgeons, physicians, and other medical providers are generally made on a local basis, based on their individual evaluation of the relative quality of care provided by us and our local market competitors. Therefore, our national scale may not provide a competitive advantage in any particular market in which we operate.
We also compete with regional and local O&P providers for the retention and recruitment of qualified O&P clinicians. In some markets, the demand for clinicians exceeds the supply of qualified persons.
Our Products & Services segment competes with other distributors, manufacturers that sell their products directly, and providers of equipment and services on a regional and national basis that have similar sales forces and products. Some of our distributor competitors are also dedicated to the O&P industry, but many others are large medical product distributors who also distribute O&P products, particularly orthotic products.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the combination of the following competitive strengths will help us to grow our businesses by increasing our net revenues, net income and market share:

● | Leading market position in both the O&P market place and the post-acute rehabilitation markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National scale of operations, which better enables us to:
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | establish our brand name and generate economies of scale;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | identify and implement best practices throughout our organization;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consistently apply the rigorous claims documentation standards required for reimbursement and facilitate reimbursement through a revenue cycle management organization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | collect, aggregate, and publish our statistically significant clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction data and metrics;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | offer a single network solution to national and regional shared fabrication facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identify, test, and deploy emerging technology; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | increase our influence on, and input into, regulatory trends;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distribution of, and purchasing power for, O&P components and finished O&P products, which better enables us to:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | negotiate greater volume-based purchasing discounts from manufacturers and freight providers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manage Hanger Clinic inventory levels on a national scale through centralized purchasing controls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | access prefabricated and finished O&P products;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | promote the usage by our patient care clinics of products that have met or exceeded Hanger Clinic standards of quality and patient care that also expand our profit margins; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expand the external client base of the distribution business in our Products & Services segment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proven ability to rapidly incorporate technological advances in the fitting and fabrication of O&P devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | History of integrating small and medium sized O&P business acquisitions, including 152 O&P businesses between 1997 and 2020, representing over 400 patient care clinics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly trained clinicians, with whom we provide the highest level of continuing education and training through programs designed to inform them of the latest technological developments in the O&P industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced and committed management team; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Beneficial government relations efforts, which enable us to educate legislators on the medical benefits and cost effectiveness of O&P services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppliers
We purchase prefabricated O&P devices, components, and materials from hundreds of suppliers across the country, which are utilized by our clinicians and technicians in the fabrication of O&P products. These devices, components, and materials are used in the products we offer in our patient care clinics throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2020, one supplier accounted for 10% or more of our annual purchases, with 15.9% of our annual purchases by dollar amount in 2020.
Sales and Marketing
In our Patient Care segment, our individual clinicians in local patient care clinics historically have conducted our sales and marketing efforts, primarily through their interaction with and provision of prosthetic or orthotic services to the patients of referring surgeons, physicians, and other providers. Due primarily to the fragmented nature of the O&P industry, the success of a particular patient care clinic has been largely a function of its local reputation for quality of care, responsiveness, and length of service in the local communities.
To augment the efforts of the business segment personnel, we have developed a centralized sales and marketing department whose efforts target the following:

● | Marketing and Public Relations. Our objective is to increase the visibility of the “Hanger” brand by building relationships with major referral sources. We also continue to explore creating alliances with certain vendors to market products and services on a nationwide basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Business Development. We have dedicated personnel in most of our operating regions who are responsible for arranging seminars, clinics, and forums to educate and consult with patients and to increase the local community’s awareness of the “Hanger” brand. These business development managers also meet with local referral and contract sources to help our clinicians develop new relationships in their markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We additionally provide certain insurance contract access and administrative services to independent O&P providers through our specialty health care company, Linkia.
Marketing of our services is conducted on a national basis through a dedicated sales force, print and e-commerce catalogs, and exhibits at industry and medical meetings and conventions. We use directed marketing to segments of the health care industry, such as orthopedic surgeons, vascular surgeons, physical and occupational therapists, patient care managers, and podiatrists, by providing specialized catalogs focused on their medical specialty.
In our Products & Services segment, we employ dedicated sales professionals that call on independent O&P providers, as well as SNFs, and are generally responsible for a geographic region or a specific product line.
Acquisition Strategy
Our strategy is to achieve long-term growth through disciplined diversification of our revenue streams, including geographic expansion or the broadening of our continuum of care through the acquisitions of high quality O&P providers. Despite our national size, we are underrepresented in certain regional and local markets, and as such, one of the primary drivers in executing our acquisition strategy is expanding our ability to serve new patients in new geographic markets. Acquisitions in our markets can be competitive because we often compete with multiple potential buyers, including two international O&P product manufacturers who have each entered the U.S. patient care market.
Once an acquisition is consummated, we integrate and generally centralize certain key functions including IT, marketing, sales, finance, and administration to ensure that we can optimize cross-selling opportunities and realize cost efficiencies.
In certain of our historical acquisitions, in addition to cash paid at closing, the purchase price has included unsecured subordinated promissory notes (“Seller Notes”) and contingent consideration terms (“earnouts”) associated with the achievement of certain designated collection targets for the acquired business. Earnouts can be used to compromise between our valuation and seller’s expectations regarding purchase price, while providing protection from our overpayment if historical collections are not an accurate indicator of post-closing financial performance of the acquired business. Currently, there are no outstanding earnouts related to our historical acquisitions.
Our evaluation of the acquired business is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position, and service and product offerings, as well as our experience and judgment.

Acquisition Activity
During 2020, we completed the following acquisitions of O&P clinics, none of which were individually material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows:

● | In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of an O&P business for total consideration of $46.2 million at fair value, of which $16.8 million was cash consideration, net of cash acquired, $21.9 million was issued in the form of notes to the former shareholders, $3.5 million in the form of a deferred payment obligation to the former shareholders, and $4.0 million in additional consideration. Of the $21.9 million in notes issued to the former shareholders, approximately $18.1 million of the notes were paid in October 2020 in a lump sum payment and the remaining $3.8 million of the notes are payable in annual installments over a period of three years on the anniversary date of the acquisition. Total payments of $4.0 million under the deferred payment obligation are due in annual installments beginning in the fourth year following the acquisition and for three years thereafter. Additional consideration includes approximately $3.6 million in liabilities incurred to the shareholders as part of the business combination payable in October 2020 and is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining $0.4 million in additional consideration represents the effective settlement of amounts due to us from the acquired O&P business as of the acquisition date. We completed the acquisition with the intention of expanding the geographic footprint of our patient care offerings through the acquisition of this high quality O&P provider. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
The operations of our business are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local governmental regulations. We make compliance with applicable regulations a corporate priority through, among other things, our compliance programs, policies and procedures, manuals, and personnel training. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide assurance that we will be in absolute compliance with all regulations at all times. Failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations may result in significant penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Fraud and Abuse. Violations of fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, False Claims Act liability (discussed below), imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA health programs, and the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program, formerly known as CHAMPUS. These laws, which include but are not limited to federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, physician self-referral laws, and federal criminal health care fraud laws, are discussed in further detail below. We believe our billing practices, operations, and compensation and financial arrangements with referral sources and others materially comply with applicable federal and state requirements. However, we cannot assure that such requirements will always be interpreted by a governmental authority in a manner consistent with our interpretation and application. The failure to comply with any of these requirements, even if inadvertent, could require us to alter our operations with and/or refund payments to the governmental authority. Such refunds could be significant and could also lead to the imposition of significant penalties. Even if we successfully defend against any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, we would likely be forced to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Any of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Anti-Kickback Laws. Our operations are subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in any form (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, or to induce, the referral of persons eligible for benefits under a federal health care program (including Medicare, Medicaid, the VA health programs, and TRICARE), or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or the recommendation of purchasing, leasing, or ordering of, items or services that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. Courts have held that the statute may be violated when even one purpose (as opposed to a primary or sole purpose) of the remuneration is to induce referrals or other business.
Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit beneficial commercial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has developed regulations addressing certain business arrangements that will offer protection from scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute. These “Safe Harbors” describe activities which may be protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided that they meet all of the requirements of the applicable Safe Harbor regulation. For example, the Safe Harbors cover activities such as offering discounts to health care providers and contracting with physicians or other individuals or entities that have the potential to refer business to us that would ultimately be billed to a federal health care program, so long as the discount is properly disclosed and appropriately reflected in any claims or charges.
Failure to qualify for Safe Harbor protection does not mean that an arrangement is illegal. Rather, the facts and circumstances of the arrangement must be analyzed to determine whether there is improper intent to pay or receive remuneration in return for referrals. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of the Safe Harbors may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. In addition, some states have anti-kickback laws that vary in scope, and may apply regardless of whether a federal health care program is involved.

Our operations and business arrangements include, for example, discount programs or other financial arrangements with individuals and entities, such as lease arrangements with hospitals and certain participation agreements. Therefore, our operations and business arrangements are required to comply with the anti-kickback laws. Although our business arrangements and operations may not always satisfy all the criteria of a Safe Harbor, we make compliance with federal and state anti-kickback statutes a corporate priority. Nonetheless, we cannot assure that the government’s interpretation of a Safe Harbor provision will always be consistent with our own, and our arrangements may be subject to scrutiny under anti-kickback laws. Noncompliance with such laws can result in a number of enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs.
In addition, some states have anti-kickback laws that vary in scope, and may apply regardless of whether a federal health care program is involved. State anti-kickback laws may extend similar anti-kickback prohibitions to other payors, including commercial payors, and these state laws do not always contain the same safe harbors as the federal regulatory scheme.
Medical Device Regulation. We provide, distribute, and lease products that are subject to regulation as medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and accompanying regulations. In our Patient Care segment, with the exception of two products which have been cleared for marketing as prescription medical devices under section 510(k) of the FDCA, we believe that the products we provide, including O&P medical devices, accessories, and components, are not Class III devices and thus are exempt from the FDA’s regulations for pre-market clearance or approval requirements and from most requirements relating to the quality system regulation (except for certain record keeping and complaint handling requirements). In our Products & Services segment, ACP manufactures, leases, and sells a number of rehabilitation devices that have been cleared or approved for marketing under section 510(k) of the FDCA, and are subject to the requirements of the quality system regulation. All of our device businesses are required to adhere to regulations for medical devices regarding adverse event reporting, establishment registration, and product listing, and we are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with all applicable requirements. Labeling and promotional materials also are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Our medical device operations are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with applicable FDA requirements, and the FDA has in the past raised compliance concerns in connection with these investigations. We make compliance with applicable FDA requirements a corporate priority, but we cannot assure that we will be found to be in compliance at all times. Noncompliance could result in a variety of civil and/or criminal enforcement actions, including issuance of a Warning Letter, seizure, examination, and inspection of our products and a civil injunction or criminal prosecution, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Physician Self-Referral Laws. We are also subject to federal and state physician self-referral laws. With certain exceptions, the federal Medicare physician self-referral law (the “Stark Law”) (Section 1877 of the Social Security Act) prohibits a physician from referring Medicare beneficiaries to an entity for “designated health services” including durable medical equipment and supplies, and prosthetic and orthotic devices and supplies, if the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity. A financial relationship includes both ownership or investment interests and compensation arrangements. An entity that furnishes designated health services pursuant to a prohibited referral may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill for such designated health services. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment for the service, an obligation to refund any payments received, civil monetary penalties, potential False Claims Act litigation, and the possibility of being excluded from the Medicare or Medicaid programs.
Despite the general prohibition on such physician financial relationships, the Stark Law and regulations promulgated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services provide a number of exceptions from the prohibitions.
With respect to compensation arrangements, there are exceptions under the Stark Law that permit physicians to maintain certain business arrangements, such as personal service contracts and equipment or space leases, with health care entities to which they refer patients for designated health services. All of the elements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order for the exception to apply. Further, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, under the Stark Law, billing prohibitions can result without specific intent to induce referrals. We strive to assure that our compensation arrangements with physicians comply with the Stark Law, either because the physician’s relationship fits fully within a Stark Law exception or because the physician does not generate prohibited referrals. If, however, we receive a prohibited referral, our submission of a bill for services rendered pursuant to such a referral could subject us to the prohibitions under the Stark Law and applicable state self-referral laws, including false claims liability, potential exclusion, and imposition of civil monetary penalties. State self-referral laws may extend the prohibitions of the Stark Law to Medicaid beneficiaries, and there are some indications that the federal government may similarly expand the reach of the law, including certain adverse court decisions, to which we were not a party.

10



False Claims Laws. We are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, are for items or services not provided as claimed, or otherwise contain misleading information. Our revenue cycle management function is responsible for the preparation of documents for the submission of reimbursement claims to third party payors for items and services furnished to patients. In addition, our personnel may, in some instances, provide advice on billing and reimbursement to purchasers of our products. Also, prosecutors and so-called “qui tam” relators (whistleblowers) may claim that a regulatory violation or wrongfully-retained overpayment may be the basis of False Claims Act litigation. Successful relators can receive a share of the recovery in a False Claims Act case ranging from 15% to 30%, depending on whether the government “intervenes” in the case. Penalties in a False Claims Act case may include double or triple damages plus penalties ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 per claim. While we endeavor to assure that our billing practices comply with applicable laws, if claims submitted to payors are deemed to be false, fraudulent, or for items or services not provided as claimed, we may face liability for presenting or causing to be presented such claims.
Certification and Licensure. Our clinicians and/or certain operating units may be subject to certification or licensure requirements under the laws of some states. Most states do not require separate licensure for clinicians. However, several states currently require clinicians to be certified by an organization such as the ABC. The ABC conducts a certification program for clinicians and an accreditation program for patient care clinics. The minimum requirements for new certified clinicians are a college degree, completion of an accredited master’s degree program, residency at a patient care clinic under the supervision of a certified clinician, and successful completion of certain examinations. Certified clinicians are required to participate in a prescribed number of hours of specialized continuing education courses to maintain their certifications. Minimum requirements for an accredited patient care clinic include the presence of a certified clinician and specific site and equipment requirements.
While we make compliance with state licensure requirements a corporate priority, we cannot assure that we will be in compliance at all times with these requirements, or how they may be interpreted or re-interpreted by the various state and local agencies. Failure to comply with state licensure requirements could result in suspension or termination of licensure, civil penalties, termination of our Medicare and Medicaid agreements, and repayment of amounts received from Medicare and Medicaid for services and supplies furnished by an unlicensed individual or entity.
Confidentiality and Privacy Laws. The Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), and their implementing regulations, set forth privacy standards and implementation specifications concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (referred to as “protected health information”) by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that transmit health information electronically in connection with certain standard transactions (“Covered Entities”). HIPAA further requires Covered Entities to protect the confidentiality of protected health information by meeting certain security standards and implementation specifications. In addition, under HIPAA, Covered Entities that electronically transmit certain administrative and financial transactions must utilize standardized formats and data elements. HIPAA imposes civil monetary penalties for noncompliance, and criminal penalties for knowing violations of the privacy standards; violations of such standards committed under false pretenses; or with the intent to sell, transfer, or use protected health information for commercial advantage. Certain agents of Covered Entities (“business associates”) also have HIPAA responsibilities and liabilities. We have business associates and are business associates to other Covered Entities. We believe that we are subject to the Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and have made it a corporate priority to meet applicable standards and implementation specifications. The new requirements have had a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health data and communicate with payors.
In addition, state confidentiality and privacy laws may impose civil and/or criminal penalties for certain unauthorized or other uses or disclosures of protected health information. We are also subject to these laws. While we endeavor to assure that our operations comply with applicable laws governing the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information, we could face liability in the event of a use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of one or more of these laws.
Human Capital Management 
Hanger is a company of people serving people, with the collective purpose of empowering human potential together. We believe the exceptional talent and clinical focus of our clinicians, as well as the strength of our overall workforce, have significantly contributed to our success as a leading provider of O&P products and services. Our values include Integrity, Patient-Focused, Outcomes, Collaboration, and Innovation. Our Hanger vision, culture, and values, taken together, provide a roadmap for the employee profile we seek.

11



As an essential business that enables human mobility through our patient care services, we have continued to operate our business throughout the period impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken measures to promote employee safety and minimize virus transmission in order to help our employees and clinicians continue to lead safe and productive lives during the outbreak, including expanded procedures in our O&P clinics and operational locations related to personal safety, cleaning and medical screening measures and remote working arrangements. For additional discussion surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, please refer to the “Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic” section of this document.
Our Board of Directors and its committees receive regular updates about our performance from our senior management team, including: talent acquisition, development, and performance management, including hiring, promotion and leadership data; diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) metrics with respect to representation, hiring and leadership; and total rewards data based on compensation studies and market data.
Talent Acquisition, Development & Performance Management
Attracting and developing talented employees devoted to patient care is core to the success we have enjoyed for nearly 160 years. Many of our employees are patient-facing clinical talent, who are driven by a desire to serve their patients. Our position as a leading provider in the O&P industry, combined with the depth of expertise across our organization, offers a unique value proposition for our network of clinicians. We have assembled a dedicated workforce of clinical talent and expertise, which serves as a vast network within which our O&P professionals are able to collaborate across the nation. Our industry luminaries share experiences and advice freely across the country, through hands-on training at our annual Hanger LIVE education and business meeting, through virtual and live workshops, and personal consults across the country.
We invest in talent development programs for our employees with annual training events held for clinical talent, as well as virtual training programs for clinical and support staff. Hanger LIVE is an annual event offering over 100 training sessions on topics ranging from clinical outcomes, best practices and resources, leadership skills, and the latest in O&P technology. Historically, this event has been offered onsite for approximately 1,500 attendees, including employees and exhibitors. In 2021, we held our first virtual Hanger LIVE event, enabling all our employees to participate in the various business and clinical education sessions.
With approximately two million patient encounters per year, we have a built-in feedback loop to indicate how our development efforts improve patient outcomes. Internally, and through external partnerships, we strive for innovation in patient care through technology, research, and training. We focus on delivering value-based outcomes for our patients and provide our clinicians with the tools and information to make evidence-based decisions in today’s healthcare environment. To that end, we have published multiple research studies to share our clinical findings with our approximately 1,600 clinicians and the broader O&P community at large to educate, inform, and better prepare them to serve patients utilizing the best available scientific evidence, clinical techniques, and recommendations.
We focus on the attraction and retention of all employees. We grow our talent base through organic hiring, acquisition of patient care clinics, and our clinical residency program. We hire approximately 60 to 70 residents per year and offer a formal training program supported by our extensive clinical expertise with approximately 1,600 clinical providers in 46 states and the District of Columbia. Residents have the opportunity to relocate to any of our 816 patient care clinics across the nation. Given the nationwide reach and diversity of patients served, clinicians have the ability to specialize in different areas of O&P based on their interests, as well as have the opportunity to work with some of the best clinicians in their areas of expertise at Hanger.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and Inclusion are core tenets of our corporate culture, one that embraces a diverse workforce and the realization of the critical role it plays in our success. Hanger strives to build a culture of diversity and inclusion through its human resource practices and policies and actively works to eliminate discrimination and harassment. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion begins with our Board of Directors and executive officers, with over 50% and 40%, respectively, identifying as female or as a person of color. Through our ongoing investments in expanding diversity, we have increased the amount of female representation in incoming resident classes to over 50%, which we believe is an important first step in advancing underrepresented demographics in the O&P industry. We are also investing in developing our female, racial and ethnic minority team members as part of our succession planning efforts to increase diversity in leadership positions.

12



We foster a culture of diversity and inclusion through our sponsorship of programs such as affinity groups that include Women in Leadership, Hanger Disability Awareness Network, Hanger Veterans Network, Hanger LGBTQ Network, and PAUSE (People Aligned United to Serve Everyone). We have instituted a Diversity and Inclusion Council, consisting of twelve employees, and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, which identifies specific actions we can take to increase diversity and foster inclusion at Hanger and, more broadly, in the O&P profession. We have instituted a Diversity and Inclusion Pledge with specific actions to accelerate and elevate our own efforts and invited O&P industry peers and partners to join us in this charge. We have a D&I Ambassadors program open to all employees who are interested in sharing ideas and getting involved in this movement. Our Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for developing and integrating our D&I Plans throughout the Company.
Total Rewards
Our pay strategy includes an emphasis on performance, factors of role, individual skills and abilities, alignment with external shareholders, and competitive offerings in markets in which we compete for talent. We continue to invest in our workforce through competitive salaries and incentive programs aimed at short-term and long-term performance. Our health and welfare benefits include medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, and prescription drug benefits. We offer health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, access to financial planners, a retirement savings plan with company match, telemedicine, and various paid time off programs, including pay for time spent volunteering or on military duty. We have launched a wellness program designed to promote holistic well-being across eight dimensions: physical, financial, occupational, spiritual, emotional, social, intellectual, and environmental, and are in the process of implementing a wellness portal that will be personalized to reflect each employee’s specific health and welfare interests.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,700 people.
Insurance
We currently maintain insurance coverage for professional liability, product liability, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation, executive protection, property damage, and other lines of insurance. Our general liability insurance coverage is $1.0 million per occurrence, with a $25.0 million umbrella insurance policy. The coverage for professional liability, product liability, and workers’ compensation is self-insured with both individual specific claim and aggregate stop-loss policies to protect us from either significant individual claims or dramatic changes in our loss experience. Based on our experience and prevailing industry practices, we believe our coverage is adequate as to risks and amount.
