ITEM 1.               BUSINESS
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc. (“Broadmark Realty” or the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, is an internally managed commercial real estate finance company that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Based in Seattle, Washington, we specialize in underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term, first deed of trust loans to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties. We operate in select states that we believe to have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. In March 2020, we launched a private real estate investment trust (the “Private REIT”) offered to qualified purchasers that is managed by our subsidiary and that participates in our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio of 204 active loans had approximately $1.2 billion of total commitments and $860.1 million of principal outstanding, of which approximately $82.4 million and $37.7 million, respectively, were sold to the Private REIT. Our active loans are made across 145 borrowers in 12 states and the District of Columbia. We refer to loans that have outstanding commitments or principal balances that have not been repaid or retired, including loans in foreclosure, as “active loans.” Total commitments refer to the aggregate sum of outstanding principal balances, construction holdbacks and committed amounts for future draws and interest reserves on our loans. To date our loan portfolio has been 100% equity funded, and as of December 31, 2020, we have no outstanding debt. As a public company, we plan to opportunistically raise capital in the public market from time to time based on market conditions and to execute on cash management tools to fund the business and produce attractive returns for our stockholders. On February 19, 2021, we closed on a $135.0 million revolving credit facility, which we expect will enable us to use a larger percentage of our cash balances for lending activities without planning to incur debt in the ordinary course of business.
Properties securing our loans are generally classified as residential properties, commercial properties or undeveloped land, and are typically not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate. Our lending policy limits the committed amount of each loan to a maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of up to 65% of the “as-complete” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. Our lending policy also limits the initial outstanding principal balance of each loan to a maximum LTV of up to 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. At the time of origination, the difference between the initial outstanding principal and the total commitment is the amount held back for future release subject to property inspections, progress reports and other conditions in accordance with the loan documents. Unless otherwise indicated, LTV is measured by the total commitment amount of the loan at origination divided by the “as-complete” appraisal. LTVs do not reflect interim activity such as construction draws or interest payments capitalized to loans, or partial repayments of the loan. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average LTV was 59.4% across our active loan portfolio based on the total commitment of the loan and “as-complete” appraisals. In addition, each loan is also personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower, and/or others at our discretion to provide further credit support for the loan. The personal guarantee may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate or assets owned by the guarantor.
Our loans typically range from $0.1 to $40 million in total commitment at origination, generally bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 10% to 13% and have initial terms typically ranging from five to 18 months in duration based on the size of the project and expected timeline for completion of construction, which we often elect to extend for several months based on our evaluation of the project. As of December 31, 2020, the average total commitment of our active loans was $6.1 million and the weighted average remaining term to contractual maturity of our active loans was approximately seven months. We usually receive loan origination fees, or “points,” typically ranging from 4% to 5% of the total commitment at origination, along with loan amendment and extension fees, each of which varies in amount based upon the term of the loan and the quality of the borrower and the underlying collateral. In addition, we charge fees on past due receivables and receive reimbursements from borrowers for costs associated with services provided by us, such as closing costs, collection costs on defaulted loans and construction draw inspection fees.

Our typical borrowers include real estate investors, developers and other commercial borrowers. We do not lend to owner-occupants of residential real estate. Loan proceeds are generally used to fund the vertical construction, horizontal development, investment, land acquisition and refinancing of residential properties and to a lesser extent commercial properties. We also make loans to fund the renovation and rehabilitation of residential and commercial properties. Our loans are generally structured with partial funding at closing and additional loan installments disbursed to the borrower upon satisfactory completion of previously agreed stages of construction.
A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from our customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers, a limited amount of advertising, and through our website.
We seek to minimize risk of loss through our disciplined underwriting standards. We originate and fund loans secured by first deed of trust liens on residential and commercial real estate located in states that we believe have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. We believe that the demand/supply imbalance for residential construction-related real estate loans presents significant opportunities for us to selectively originate high-quality first deed of trust loans on attractive terms.
We built our business on a deep knowledge of the residential and commercial real estate market combined with a risk management approach that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe our flexibility and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on risk, our expertise in the loan market and our focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans have been the basis for our success.
In addition to the natural seasonality inherent in our business whereby winter months are typically less favorable to construction, restrictions related to the Business Combination decreased the amount of our loan originations for the second half of 2019 and early 2020. The pending Business Combination required us to essentially pause our ability to raise capital and in turn originate new loans for most of the second half of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we focused on rebuilding our pipeline and began to strategically deploy the proceeds from the Business Combination; these rebuilding efforts began to slow in March due to the uncertainty associated with the impacts of COVID-19. In March 2020, we launched the Private REIT to provide access to an additional source of capital and fund participations in loans originated by Broadmark Realty. We believe the Private REIT enhances our ability to increase originations and grow our asset base, subject to market conditions. As of December 31, 2020, the Private REIT’s participation in the total principal balance funded and outstanding was approximately $37.7 million.
The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting, and can be expected to continue to impact, the capital markets and the construction lending market, at least in the near term. While we have implemented a variety of business continuity initiatives, restrictions imposed in connection with COVID-19 or the impact on key employees, could create significant challenges for our operations. We have experienced an adverse impact on our loan portfolio primarily in the form of a significant increase in defaulted loans, a slow-down in construction progress and an expected reduction in demand for and the value of commercial and residential real estate properties. For example, delays in local government permitting and inspections arising from measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have delayed some projects, adversely affecting the ability of borrowers to complete the projects in accordance with the terms of the loans. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures have contributed to, among other things, adverse impacts on demand for and the value of commercial and residential real estate that our borrowers have developed that make it less likely that a borrower can sell or lease the property it is developing in an amount sufficient to repay the borrower’s loan, or that a developer, who would be our borrower, will elect to go forward with a new project. As a result, during the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in delinquencies and requests for extensions or forbearance, which declined during the second half of 2020. In addition, market conditions, and in some cases moratoriums on the foreclosure process have increased the timeline to resolve non-performing loans. Delays in repayment of our outstanding loans or sales of foreclosed properties reduce the capital available for future loan originations. If the pandemic is prolonged, it could increase the adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Markets
At December 31, 2020, we have active loans in 12 states and the District of Columbia with the majority of loans located in Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho. We strategically focus on these states as they have exhibited strong population growth. At December 31, 2020, more than 90% of our portfolio was secured by properties located in states ranked in the top ten for migration between 2010 and 2019 according to the Census Bureau, including Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho. Additionally, each of Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho are non-judicial foreclosure states, which we believe encourages borrowers to comply with the loan terms and provides us the option to take control of the collateral more quickly in the event of borrower default. We continue to increase our national presence, and in this regard, began operating in the Southeast region in 2018 and the Mid-Atlantic region in 2019 and expect further expansion into states that meet our preferred criteria.
Industry and Market Opportunity

Real estate investment is a capital-intensive business that typically relies heavily on debt capital to acquire, develop, improve, construct, renovate and maintain properties. We focus on providing construction, development and investment loans for the U.S. housing and real estate industries. Due to structural changes in banking, regulation and monetary policies over the last decade, there has been a reduction in the number of lenders servicing this segment. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to originate real estate loans secured by the underlying real estate as collateral. Our management team further believes that the demand for relatively small real estate loans to construct, develop or invest in residential or, to a lesser extent commercial real estate, located in states with favorable demographic trends presents a compelling opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Historically, regional and community banks were the primary providers of construction financing to smaller, private builders. Over the past several decades, there has been significant consolidation within the commercial banking industry, with the number of commercial and savings institutions having decreased by 61% and 72%, respectively, between 1992 and 2019, as reported by the FDIC. In addition, many traditional real estate lenders that competed for loan origination within our target markets have been faced with tighter capital constraints due to changing banking regulations following the 2008 financial crisis. 
While the number of traditional banks and construction loans offered by them has steadily declined, private residential construction spending and housing starts have continued to recover from the lows following the recession of 2007 through 2009. Housing starts and completions in December 2020 were at seasonally adjusted annual rates of 1.6 and 1.4 million, respectively, an approximate five and eight percent increase from 2019. The U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development chart below illustrates historical housing permits, starts and completions from 2015 to 2020:
​

While the increases are positive, housing starts and completions still remain below long term historical averages. In a February 2020 report, Freddie Mac estimated that there were 29 states that had a housing deficit, and that approximately 3.3 million units in the aggregate were needed to make up this deficit. The map below shows the housing deficit as a percentage of the housing supply by state as set forth in the report.
​
Estimate of Housing Stock Deficit as Proportion of State Housing Stock 
Source: Freddie Mac
We operate in seven of the ten states with the largest housing deficits. The ten states with the largest housing deficits have significant overlap with the states with the highest net migration rates between 2010 and 2019 according to the Census Bureau. 
As a result of limited residential housing supply, net migration trends and the current low interest rate environment for home buyers, we believe the longer-term outlook for new housing demand in our markets remains strong.
Business and Growth Strategy
Our objective is to preserve and protect stockholder capital while producing attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through dividends generated from current income from our loan portfolio. Our business strategy is to directly originate, fund, manage, and service short-term loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property to enable us to generate attractive returns. We believe our ability to react quickly to the needs of borrowers, flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, consistency and expediency in funding future construction draws, intimate knowledge of the relevant markets in which we operate, and focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans positions us to generate attractive returns.
Our strategy to achieve our objective of continuing to generate attractive returns and grow our business includes the following:


● | continue to increase market share in existing states to satisfy unmet demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase geographic footprint by focusing on states with favorable economic and demographic trends that provide efficient access to collateral in the event of borrower default;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market resulting from consolidation and increased regulatory oversight of commercial banks and savings institutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capitalize on the relative strength of our balance sheet to grow our customer and asset base while competitors with weaker balance sheets may be capital constrained;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maximize earnings generation from deployed capital through timely resolution of loans in contractual default;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimize working capital through efficient cash management and the use of our revolving credit facility;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fund growth via strategic and structured capital sourcing, and periodic sales of equity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | remain flexible in order to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in various points of an economic cycle; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operate so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Operations Overview
Loan Origination and Due Diligence
We are experienced in secured lending, with significant combined real estate and financial services experience of our senior management team. Our senior management team spends a significant portion of its time on borrower development as well as on underwriting and structuring the loans in our portfolio. A principal source of our new transactions has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. We are a collateral based lender and when underwriting a loan, the primary focus of our analysis is the value of a property and the borrower’s equity in the project. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application, we conduct extensive due diligence of the property as well as of the borrower and its principals.
The mortgage loans that we originate generally meet the following criteria:

● | Collateral. New loans are secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | Amount. The amount of our loans typically range from $0.1 to $40 million in total commitment at origination (average total commitment of $6.1 million for our active loans at December 31, 2020). Our lending policy limits exposure to any single borrower or guarantor to 7.0% of the aggregate total commitment of our active loans.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Loan to Value. The maximum LTV ratio for a loan at origination is 65.0% of the "as-complete" appraised value of the underlying collateral; and a maximum initial outstanding principal balance of the loan at origination is 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral, in each case as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interest rate. Generally, a fixed rate between 10% and 13% per annum with a late fee of 10% of the amount outstanding and a default interest rate of 24% per annum for loans in contractual default status.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Origination fees. Typically ranges from 4% to 5% of the total commitment at origination. In addition, if the term of the loan is extended, additional points are payable upon the extension.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Term. Typically, five to 18 months at origination. We may agree to extend the maturity date (typically for one to three months) and charge an extension fee, so long as the borrower complies with all loan covenants and the loan otherwise satisfies our underwriting criteria.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Covenants. To timely pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and similar charges with respect to the property; to maintain hazard insurance; and to maintain and protect the property.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Events of default. Include: (i) failure to make the required monthly interest-only loan payment when due; (ii) failure to repay the loan at maturity date if we have not agreed to extend maturity and (iii) breach of a covenant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment terms. Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date. Interest earned from an interest holdback is capitalized in the loan principal balance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Escrow. Generally, none required.
--+----------------------------------


● | Holdbacks. Construction loans typically include a holdback for future construction draws which are funded in arrears following confirmation of work completion. Loans may also include a holdback for interest reserves for the purpose of satisfying monthly interest payments over all or part of the term of the loan due to a lack of income generated by the real estate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security. Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first deed of trust lien on real property owned by the borrower and is personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower and/or others, at our discretion, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate owned by the guarantor.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fees and Expenses. As is typical in real estate finance transactions, the borrower incurs all expenses in connection with securing the loan, including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of an environmental assessment report, if any, the cost of a credit report and all title, recording fees and legal fees.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon receipt of a potential borrower’s executed loan application, we will commence the underwriting process. Before approving and funding a loan, we undertake extensive due diligence of the borrower, its principals, the guarantor and the property that will be mortgaged to secure the loan. Such due diligence generally includes:

● | Borrower and Guarantor Information. Review of a borrower’s credit application, operating agreement or other organizational documents, and review of business and guarantor financial statements and tax returns.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Confirmatory Collateral Information. Review of an independent appraisal report (customarily including market data and analysis and information regarding comparable properties), preliminary title report, tax records, documentation evidencing proper hazard insurance for improved property, and other property information. Loans secured by existing commercial properties require a Phase I environmental site assessment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | Project Transaction Information. Review of the property purchase and sale agreement, title insurance, itemized construction budget, project schedule with milestones, building permits/entitlements, building plans, and building specifications and architectural renderings, resumes and recent projects of builder and architect and marketing plans and materials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical Inspection. We perform a physical inspection of the property, which includes a check of the property’s location, characteristics, qualities, and potential value as represented by the borrower, as well as a review of the comparable properties identified in the independent appraisal report in order to confirm that the properties identified as comparable in the appraisal report are truly comparable.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loan Servicing
We service all of our loans internally, and manage loan payments, draw requests, and loan accounting records. The loan draw process in particular is an important part of our business as it provides borrowers with quick access to capital in order to keep their projects moving and allows us to inspect the quality and pace of the borrower’s work. Once a borrower has submitted a draw request, we will have the property physically inspected by an approved third-party to ensure that the work for which funding is being requested has been completed, in a manner satisfactory to us. In addition, any required county and city inspections are completed and a date-down endorsement of the title policy is provided by the title company indicating no liens have been placed on the property since its original issuance of the title insurance policy before funds are disbursed. If the request is made for the final draw of a project, a certificate of occupancy or sign-off by the city is required prior to disbursement. Although the process is thorough, we make a point of responding to draw requests as quickly as possible as timing is of paramount importance to a project’s success.
In addition, we conduct periodic testing, process loan payoff requests, and collect past due and delinquent payments. In the case of a contractual loan default, we have broad authority to take such actions as we believe best in working out the defaulted loan, including selling the defaulted loan or foreclosing on the real property serving as collateral for the loan.
Loan Funding
Historically, our ability to grow our business was primarily constrained by our ability to raise capital to fund additional real estate loans. Prior to the Business Combination, we funded loans primarily through the use of private capital. Going forward, we intend to fund our growth through issuance of common stock, use of cash management tools such as our revolving credit facility, and the sale of participation interests in loans to the Private REIT (as described below).
Private REIT
The Private REIT primarily participates in short-term, first deed of trust loans secured by real estate to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties located in the United States that are originated, underwritten and serviced by a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty. The Private REIT is managed by Broadmark Private REIT Management, LLC (the “Private REIT Manager”), a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty. Similar to Broadmark Realty, the Private REIT’s investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through fees and interest income primarily generated from investing in participation interests in Broadmark Realty’s real estate portfolio. The Private REIT began investing in March 2020 and expects to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes at such point in time as the Private REIT satisfies the requirements for making such election and certain other conditions are met. The Private REIT will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes until such election is made, should the Private REIT not make the election to be taxed as a REIT effective as of its initial tax year.

Broadmark Realty and the Private REIT entered into a Master Loan Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) pursuant to which a subsidiary of Broadmark Realty expects to sell to the Private REIT participation interests in loans that it originates. Broadmark Realty retains sole authority with respect to whether to permit the Private REIT to participate in any particular loan. Broadmark Realty also retains sole authority with respect to the participation percentage of each loan that the Private REIT will receive. The Private REIT’s participations in Broadmark Realty’s loans will be limited by the amount of the Private REIT’s “Cash Available to Lend,” as defined in its governing documents. “Cash Available to Lend” is generally defined as cash in excess of the Private REIT’s obligations under existing mortgages or participations therein, including contributions of cash from the admission of new investors and repayments of mortgages or sales of assets, but excluding cash distributable to investors, existing or accrued liabilities, reserves for estimated construction draws and anticipated redemption payments, or write-downs of defaulted mortgages. In the event that the Private REIT has Cash Available to Lend in excess of the loan participation interests offered to it by Broadmark Realty, the Private REIT may originate its own mortgages or purchase mortgages from third parties that are comparable to those originated by Broadmark Realty.
Through a market-based arrangement, the Private REIT Manager is compensated with respect to the mortgages initiated by the Private REIT or participations in Broadmark Realty’s mortgages through the Private REIT Manager’s receipt of 80% of all fee-based income (generally borrower loan fees, including origination points, late fees and extension fees) from such loans and/or participations and 20% of all cash distributable to Private REIT investors in excess of the monthly 0.5% preferred return to investors.
The Private REIT is continuously offering its preferred units to qualified investors in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The initial sale of Private REIT preferred units occurred in March 2020, and at December 31, 2020, the Private REIT’s participation in the total principal balance funded and outstanding was approximately $37.7 million.
Competition
Real estate lending is a competitive business. We compete for lending opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other “hard money” lenders, mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity real estate funds, hedge funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, non-bank financial institutions, governmental bodies, family offices, and high net worth individuals. New parties continue to enter the market resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure. 
We primarily compete on the basis of borrower relationships, product offerings, loan structure, terms, and service rather than on price. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and their representatives, offer creative structures and attractive loan terms and, most importantly, provide superior service.
Seasonality
While we typically originate loans year-round, incremental loan disbursements are made with greater frequency during the spring, summer and fall, when weather is generally more favorable for construction, and borrowers complete previously agreed stages of construction, allowing developers to draw down on additional amounts of capital available under their loan agreements. As a result of these more frequent disbursements, we generally maintain greater amounts of cash on hand to fund disbursements during these seasons.

Human Capital
Our culture is defined by our core values of integrity, collaboration, diversity, accountability, reliability and community. Our employees represent our greatest asset. We value our employees by investing in a healthy work-life balance, competitive compensation and benefit packages and a vibrant, team-oriented environment centered on open and compassionate communication. We strive to build and maintain a high-performing culture by creating a work environment that attracts and retains outstanding, engaged employees who embody our company mission of “Empowering real estate developers and investors to improve places and spaces in our communities.” The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following: 

● | Demographics. As of December 31, 2020 we employed 54 full and part time employees across the United States. During 2020 we hired 17 employees. Our voluntary turnover rate was 6.4% in 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversity and Inclusion. We strive toward having a diverse team of employees, knowing we are better together with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. We value and embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring and development practices. Of our employee population, approximately 50% are women and approximately 31% have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compensation and Benefits. We provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include discretionary annual bonuses and stock awards, a SIMPLE IRA Plan with an employer matching contribution in addition to an employer annual contribution, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings, paid time off, family leave and an employee assistance program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Communication and Engagement. We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including weekly company-wide calls with executives and frequent email corporate communications. Also, to continuously monitor and improve employee performance and engagement, we conduct annual performance reviews. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Health, Safety and Wellness. The health, safety, and wellness of our employees are vital to our success. In 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted to a remote work environment ahead of mandatory stay-at-home orders and provided employees with resources, including virtual tools and ergonomic equipment, to maximize work-from-home efficiency.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Community Partnership. We match each employee’s financial contribution to eligible nonprofit organizations on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to $1,000 per employee each calendar year, to increase the impact of their charitable gifts. Each employee also receives eight hours per calendar year of paid volunteer time off to use at the eligible non-profit(s) of his or her choice, and we donate $25 to the organization for each hour volunteered by our employees.

Regulation and Compliance
Our operations are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal government authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, Broadmark Realty and our subsidiaries may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Investment Company Act, and the Investment Advisers Act. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control.

Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
In general, commercial real estate lending is a highly regulated industry in the United States. Certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements, require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. We are required to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the states in which we do business. We are also required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA Patriot Act, and regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control.
Exemptions from Investment Company Act
Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we believe that none of the Company, our subsidiary that issues and holds the mortgages (the “Mortgage Subsidiary”) or the Private REIT is currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, our business strategies may evolve over time.
​
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
The Company believes it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because it will not engage primarily, or propose to engage primarily, or hold itself out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, the Company is primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of its wholly owned subsidiaries.

The Company believes that it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. The Company is a holding company that conducts its operations and holds assets primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Mortgage Subsidiary. The Mortgage Subsidiary is excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which provides an exclusion for companies engaged primarily in investment in mortgages and other liens on or interests in real estate. In order to qualify for this exclusion, the Mortgage Subsidiary must maintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC’s Division of Investment Management in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of its total assets in mortgage loans and other related assets that are considered “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate” (“Qualifying Interests”), and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets. In the absence of SEC guidance that supports the treatment of other investments as Qualifying Interests, the Mortgage Subsidiary will treat those other investments appropriately as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets depending on the circumstances. With respect to the Company’s other subsidiaries that maintain this exclusion or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), or otherwise do not meet the definition of “investment company,” the Company’s interests in these subsidiaries do not and will not constitute “investment securities.”

The Private REIT is not registered, and does not intend to register, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act in reliance upon an exclusion from the definition of investment company provided in Section 3(c)(7) or Section (c)(1) of the Investment Company Act.

Exemption from Investment Advisers Act

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is required to register under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), or under any state securities laws, based on their current activities. The Private REIT Manager relies on the exemption from registration under the Advisers Act registration for certain private fund advisers set forth in Section 203(m)(1) of the Advisers Act and Rule 203(m)-1 promulgated thereunder. 
The Private REIT Manager will be required to register with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act after its assets under management reach $150 million or more, unless another exemption is available. If required to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, the Private REIT Manager will become subject to substantial regulation under such act, including compliance policies and procedures requirements, books and record keeping obligations, and obligations to receive client consent to certain transactions, including any change in control of the Private REIT Manager. 
Exemption from Securities Act of 1933

The Private REIT continuously offers its preferred units to qualified investors in a private placement pursuant to Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

Compliance with Broker-Dealer Regulations

The Private REIT has engaged a registered broker-dealer to act as placement agent, and the Private REIT Manager voluntarily has agreed to pay the placement agent’s annual fee for the first year without reimbursement from the Private REIT. Certain of the Private REIT Manager’s personnel are registered representatives of the placement agent who market the Private REIT preferred units to eligible investors. Although neither the placement agent nor its registered representatives receive any sales commission with respect to the Private REIT preferred units, the Private REIT Manager’s personnel are eligible to receive a bonus from the Company based on multiple factors, including the growth of the Private REIT Manager. The Private REIT and the Private REIT Manager have engaged third party broker-dealers to refer investors. The Private REIT Manager typically pays an initial referral fee to third-party broker-dealers equal to 1.0% of a subscriber’s accepted capital contribution to the Private REIT, and, after the first anniversary thereof, an annual fee of 0.50% of the accepted contribution, payable quarterly in arrears for so long as such subscriber continues to hold Private REIT preferred units.
