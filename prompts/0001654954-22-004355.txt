Item 1. Business
GENERAL

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company” or “PGI” refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries.  The Company’s executive offices are at 212 S. Central, St. Louis, Missouri, 63105, and its telephone number is (314) 512-8650.

The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990’s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land.  Over approximately the last 30 years, the Company’s business focus and emphasis changed substantially as it has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts almost exclusively on the disposition of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt.

The Company’s remaining land inventory consists of two single family lots, an approximate 7 acre parcel and some other minor parcels of real estate consisting of easements in Citrus County, Florida, which are owned through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sugarmill Woods, Inc. (“Sugarmill Woods”). The single family lots and the 7 acre parcel in Citrus County have been listed for sale with a real estate agent and they are all under contract for sale for approximately $225,000.  In 2021, four single family lots were sold and Sugarmill Woods realized approximately $80,000.  In addition, sale proceeds were received by PGI for an environmentally sensitive parcel of land for which there was no cost basis.  Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. (“PGIS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 58 acres, but these parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale.  

QUALIFICATION AS INACTIVE REGISTRANT FOR SEC PURPOSES

In early 2019, the Board of Directors of PGI concluded that PGI met and continues to meet all of the conditions under which a registrant may be deemed an “Inactive Entity” as that term is defined or contemplated in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and as the term “Inactive Registrant” is further contemplated in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance’s Financial Reporting Manual section 1320.2. Under Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X, the financial statements required thereunder with respect to an Inactive Registrant for purposes of reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including but not limited to annual reports on Form 10-K, may be unaudited.  A representative of PGI informally discussed its view that PGI is an Inactive Registrant with a staff member of the Chief Accountant’s Office in the Division of Corporation Finance in February 2019.

Item 1. Business (continued)

As an Inactive Registrant, PGI currently intends to continue to timely file Annual Reports on Forms 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including this Form 10-K, as well as Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q and any other required reports. PGI currently intends to include in such Annual Reports all annual consolidated financial statements required to be included therein pursuant to Regulation S-X. The consolidated financial statements were audited prior to 2019 by BKD, LLP and a review was performed with respect to 2019 by Milhouse & Neal. However, due to its inactive status and diminishing financial resources, the aforementioned consolidated financial statements have not been reviewed or audited by a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) registered public accounting firm for the year 2021 and 2020.  

PGI meets all of the conditions in Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X for an “Inactive Registrant” which are:


(a) | Gross receipts not in excess of $100,000; 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Not purchasing or selling any of its own stock or granted options therefor; 
(c) | Expenditures for all purposes not in excess of $100,000; 
(d) | No material change in the business has occurred during the fiscal year; 
(e) | No securities exchange or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the entity requires the entity to furnish audited financial statements.


PGI has been a SEC registrant for over 40 years.  As the Company reviews its circumstances, it has met the conditions as an Inactive Registrant since 2017.  

The Company, formerly a Florida residential developer, is dormant with less than 70 acres of remaining landholdings, much of which has little value due to various restrictions. The Company’s consolidated financial statements show it has a Stockholders’ Deficiency of $95.1 million as of December 31, 2021.  BKD, LLP (“BKD”), the Company’s PCAOB registered public accounting firm until the date the Company filed its Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018 which was February 25, 2019, expressed a “going concern” opinion with respect to the Company for its Fiscal 2018 financial statements and had expressed such opinions for many years previously.  PGI has had no trading of its securities in many years.  Contracts for sale of the 7 acre parcel and two other single family lots are signed for sale proceeds of approximately $225,000.  Any future real estate transactions by the Company will be limited, uncertain as to timing and as to value.  Ultimately, PGI expects that proceeds from sales of its remaining real estate, if any, will provide some minimal recoveries for PGI’s senior debtholders.
