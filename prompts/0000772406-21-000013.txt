Company Strategy
Cirrus Logic targets growing markets where we can leverage our expertise in advanced mixed-signal processing to solve complex problems.  The Company has identified three growth vectors that are expected to fuel opportunities in the coming years. First, we anticipate strengthening our position as the leading audio supplier in smartphones. Second, we are focused on increasing sales of audio components in applications beyond smartphones. And third, we are drawing on our extensive mixed-signal engineering expertise to develop solutions in new, adjacent product areas that we believe will drive diversification beyond the audio domain. Our approach has been to develop custom and general market components that embody our latest innovations, which we use to engage key players in a particular market or application.  We focus on building strong engineering relationships with our customers’ product teams and work to develop highly differentiated components that address their technical and price requirements across product tiers. Many of our products include programmable aspects and are comprised of our best-in-class hardware which incorporates software algorithms from some combination of our own intellectual property (“IP”), algorithms that have been ported to our platform by an ecosystem of third-party partners, and our customers’ IP. When we have been successful with this approach, one initial design win has often expanded into additional products. This strategy gives us the opportunity to increase our content with a customer over time through the incorporation of new features, the integration of other system components into our products and the addition of new components.
Markets and Products
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company adjusted how we report product line revenue to better represent our business and strategic focus. The revised product line categories are Audio and High-Performance Mixed-Signal, compared to Portable and Non-Portable and Other Products in prior periods. While we continue to see new opportunities for growth in the coming years with audio products in both smartphones and in applications beyond smartphones, we believe our investment in high-performance mixed-signal products will drive product diversification and fuel exciting additional avenues of growth. See Note 9 - Revenues for disclosure of revenue associated with modified product line categories and revenue as previously reported.
The following provides a detailed discussion regarding our audio and high-performance mixed-signal product lines. 
Audio Products:  Smart codecs, boosted amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters and standalone digital signal processors.
High-Performance Mixed-Signal Products:  Haptic driver and sensing solutions, camera controllers and power-related components.
AUDIO PRODUCTS
Cirrus Logic is a leading supplier of low-power, low-latency, high-precision audio components that are used in a variety of applications including smartphones, tablets, truly wireless headsets, laptops, AR/VR headsets, home theater systems, 

automotive entertainment systems and professional audio systems. We have an extensive portfolio of products, including “codecs” - chips that integrate analog-to-digital converters (“ADCs”) and digital-to-analog converters (“DACs”) into a single integrated circuit ("IC"), “smart codecs” - codecs with digital signal processing integrated, boosted amplifiers, as well as standalone digital signal processors (“DSPs”). Additionally, the Company’s SoundClear® technology consists of a broad portfolio of tools, software and algorithms that help to differentiate our customers’ products by improving the user experience with features such as louder, high-fidelity sound, high-quality audio playback, voice capture, hearing augmentation and active noise cancellation. 
HIGH-PERFORMANCE MIXED-SIGNAL PRODUCTS
Drawing on our extensive mixed-signal design and low-power processing expertise, Cirrus Logic has expanded beyond our traditional audio domain into new categories where we provide a range of high-performance mixed-signal ICs, including haptic driver and sensing solutions, camera controllers and power-related components. These products help deliver a more immersive and compelling user experience in a wide array of applications including smartphones, tablets, wearables and laptops. This product line also includes legacy industrial and energy applications such as digital utility meters, power supplies, energy control, energy measurement and energy exploration.
Customers, Marketing, and Sales
We offer products worldwide through both direct and indirect sales channels. Our major customers are among the world’s leading electronics manufacturers. We target both large existing and emerging customers that derive value from our expertise in advanced analog and mixed-signal design processing, systems-level integrated circuit engineering and embedded software development. We derive our revenues from both domestic and international sales. Our domestic sales force includes direct sales offices located primarily in California and Texas.  International sales offices and staff are located in Japan, People’s Republic of China, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. We supplement our direct sales force with external sales representatives and distributors.  We have technical support centers in China, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States. Our worldwide sales force provides geographically specific support to our customers and specialized selling of product lines with unique customer bases. See Note 19—Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further detail and for additional disclosure regarding sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic locations.
Since the components we produce are largely proprietary and generally not available from second sources, we generally consider our end customer to be the entity specifying the use of our component in their design. These end customers may then purchase our products directly from us, through distributors or third party manufacturers contracted to produce their designs. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, our ten largest end customers, represented approximately 93 percent, 93 percent, and 91 percent, of our sales, respectively. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had one end customer, Apple, Inc., who purchased through multiple contract manufacturers and represented approximately 83 percent, 79 percent, and 78 percent, of the Company’s total sales, respectively. No other customer or distributor represented more than 10 percent of net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019.
Manufacturing
As a fabless semiconductor company, we contract with third parties for wafer fabrication and product assembly and test. We use a variety of foundries in the production of wafers, primarily supplied by TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. The Company’s primary assembly and test houses include Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., STATS ChipPAC Pte. Ltd, Amkor Technology Inc., and SFA Semicon Co., Ltd. Our outsourced manufacturing strategy allows us to concentrate on our design strengths and minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures while giving us access to advanced manufacturing facilities. It also provides the flexibility to source multiple leading-edge technologies through strategic relationships. After wafer fabrication by the foundry, third-party assembly vendors package the wafer die. The finished products are then tested before shipment to our customers. While we do have some redundancy of fabrication processes by using multiple outside foundries, any interruption of supply by one or more of these foundries could materially impact the Company. As a result, we maintain some amount of business interruption insurance to help reduce the risk of wafer supply interruption, but we are not fully insured against such risk. Our supply chain management organization is responsible for the management of all aspects of the manufacturing, assembly, and testing of our products, including process and package development, test program development, and production testing of products in accordance with our ISO-certified quality management system.
Although our products are made from basic materials (principally silicon, metals and plastics), all of which are available from a number of suppliers, capacity at wafer foundries sometimes becomes constrained. The limited availability of certain materials may impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand needs or impact the price we are charged. The prices of certain other basic materials, such as metals, gases and chemicals used in the production of circuits can increase as demand grows for these basic commodities. In most cases, we do not procure these materials ourselves; nevertheless, we are reliant on such 

materials for producing our products because our outside foundry and package and test subcontractors must procure them. To help mitigate risks associated with constrained capacity, we use multiple foundries, assembly and test sources.
Patents, Licenses and Trademarks
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property, products, and technology. As of March 27, 2021, we held approximately 3,670 pending and issued patents worldwide, which include approximately 1,280 granted U.S. patents, 430 U.S. pending patent applications and various international patents and applications. Our U.S. patents expire in calendar years 2021 through 2040. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2021, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development.
We have maintained U.S. federal trademark registrations for CIRRUS LOGIC, CIRRUS, Cirrus Logic logo designs, and SoundClear, among others.  These U.S. registrations may be renewed as long as the marks continue to be used in interstate commerce.  We have also filed or obtained foreign registration for these marks in other countries or jurisdictions where we conduct, or anticipate conducting, international business. To complement our own research and development efforts, we have also licensed and expect to continue to license, a variety of intellectual property and technologies important to our business from third parties.
Segments
We determine our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidelines. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has been identified as the chief operating decision maker as defined by these guidelines.
The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable segment, but reports revenue performance in two product lines: Audio and High-Performance Mixed-Signal, compared to Portable and Non-Portable and Other in prior periods (discussed above). Our CEO receives and uses enterprise-wide financial information to assess financial performance and allocate resources, rather than detailed information at a product line level. Additionally, our product lines have similar characteristics and customers. They share operations support functions such as sales, public relations, supply chain management, various research and development and engineering support, in addition to the general and administrative functions of human resources, legal, finance and information technology. Therefore, there is no discrete financial information maintained for these product lines. 
See Note 9 - Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further details including sales by product line. See Note 19 — Segment Information, for details on sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic locations.
Research and Development
We concentrate our research and development efforts on the design and development of new products for each of our principal markets. We also fund certain advanced-process technology development, as well as other emerging product opportunities. Our future success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop complex new products, transfer new products to volume production, introduce them into the marketplace in a timely fashion, and have them selected for design into products of systems manufacturers. Our future success may also depend on assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products, including providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp.
Competition
Markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to increase. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit key engineering talent, execute on new product developments, partner with customers to include these new products into their applications, and provide cost efficient versions of existing products. We compete with other semiconductor suppliers that offer standard semiconductors, application-specific standard products and fully customized ICs, including embedded software, chip and board-level products.
While no single company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in all markets where our products are available. Cirrus Logic is a leading supplier of audio and high-performance mixed-signal processing solutions including codecs, smart codecs, boosted amplifiers, haptic and sensing solutions, and camera controllers. We expect to face additional competition from new entrants in our markets, which may include both large domestic and international IC manufacturers and smaller, emerging companies. Our primary competitors include, but are not limited to AKM Semiconductor Inc., Analog Devices Inc., Bestechnic (Shanghai) Co., Dialog Semiconductor PLC, DSP Group, Goodix Technology, Maxim Integrated Products Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Shanghai Awinic Technology Co., Ltd., Skyworks Solutions Inc., ST Microelectronics N.V., Synaptics Incorporated and Texas Instruments, Inc.

The principal competitive factors in our markets include: time to market; quality of hardware/software design and end-market systems expertise; price; product performance, features, quality and compatibility with standards; access to advanced process and packaging technologies at competitive prices; and sales and technical support, which includes assisting our customers with integration of our components into their new products and providing support from the concept stage through design, launch and production ramp.
Product life cycles may vary greatly by product category. For example, many consumer products have shorter design-in cycles; therefore, our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next-generation systems. Conversely, this also provides us frequent opportunities to displace competitors in products that have previously not utilized our design. 
Backlog
Sales are made primarily pursuant to short-term purchase orders for delivery of products. The quantity actually ordered by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised, without significant penalty, to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. The majority of our backlog is typically requested for delivery within six months. In markets where the end system life cycles are relatively short, customers typically request delivery in six to twelve weeks. We believe a backlog analysis at any given time gives little indication of our future business except on a short-term basis, principally within the next 60 days.
We utilize backlog as an indicator to assist us in production planning. However, backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing, and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. Quantities actually purchased by customers, as well as prices, are subject to variations between booking and delivery because of changes in customer needs or industry conditions. As a result, we believe that our backlog at any given time is an incomplete indicator of future sales.
Governmental Regulations
Our business and operations around the world are subject to government regulation at the national, state or local level addressing, among other matters, applicable environmental laws, health and safety laws and regulations, and laws relating to export controls and economic sanctions.
We believe that our properties and operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws protecting the environment and worker health and safety. As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture our own products but do maintain research and laboratory space at certain of our facilities to facilitate the development, evaluation and testing of our products. These laboratories may maintain small quantities of hazardous materials. While we believe we are in material compliance with applicable law concerning the safeguarding of these materials and with respect to other matters relating to health, safety and the environment, the risk of liability relating to hazardous conditions or materials cannot be eliminated completely. To date, we have not incurred significant expenditures relating to environmental compliance at our facilities nor have we experienced any material issues relating to employee health and safety.
In addition to environmental and worker health and safety laws, our business is subject to various rules and regulations and executive orders relating to export controls and trade sanctions. Certain of our products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which are administered by the United States Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS"), and we may from time to time be required to obtain an export license before we can export certain products or technology to specified countries or customers. In addition, the EAR imposes broad controls on entities listed on sanctioned persons lists, including the BIS Entity List. If one of our customers is listed on the BIS Entity List or another U.S. government sanctioned persons' list, we may be precluded from doing business with that customer. For example, certain of our Chinese customers, or their affiliated entities, have been added to the BIS Entity List in the last couple of years, which limits our ability to support these customers. We cannot guarantee that export control restrictions or sanctions imposed in the future will not prevent, or materially limit, our ability to conduct business with certain customers or in certain countries. Any failure to comply with these laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, including substantial monetary penalties and denial of export privileges.
For further discussion relating to the potential effects that compliance with government regulation may have upon our business, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
Human Capital
Our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical, marketing, engineering, and administrative personnel. Cirrus Logic’s goal, as it pertains to our employees, is to foster an outstanding corporate culture that encourages innovation, teamwork, and individual growth. We do this by creating programs and practices that motivate and reward our employees while helping their families thrive. We center everything we do around our corporate vision, mission and core values. The Company strives to cultivate an inclusive workplace where all employees 

feel they belong, diverse backgrounds and perspectives are valued, and everyone has an opportunity to succeed. We have adopted strategies to create an even more inclusive and positive work environment. 
We believe that we offer competitive compensation, training programs, and health and wellness benefits, designed to improve the quality of our employees’ lives, build long-term employee loyalty and attract top talent. Cirrus Logic prides itself on maintaining a world-class employee training and professional development program to maximize our employees’ success. Our comprehensive benefits, such as health insurance coverage and emotional well-being support are tailored for each country. Additional benefits focus on family care, including fertility coverage, paid parental leave, discounts for childcare, backup care and programs for new mothers. The Company also provides fitness facilities and classes at several locations, as well as other employee benefits including health screenings, flu shots, ergonomic assessments and pet insurance. Cirrus Logic provides retirement planning programs with matching contributions, such as a 401(k) plan in the United States and defined contribution pension plans for our employees in other countries. 
We believe that these benefits, combined with our corporate culture, contribute to low voluntary employee turnover. In fiscal year 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was 6 percent, below the technology industry benchmarks (2020 Radford Salary Increase and Turnover Study).
As of March 27, 2021, we had 1,481 full-time employees, of whom 69 percent were engaged in research and product development activities, 26 percent in sales, marketing, general and administrative activities, and 5 percent in manufacturing-related activities. As of March 27, 2021, 13 percent of our employees worldwide were foreign nationals and 63 percent of our total workforce reside in the U.S., with 37 percent residing offshore. We also employ individuals on a temporary basis and use the services of contractors as necessary. We have never had a work stoppage and the majority of our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements. 
Cirrus Logic is committed to promoting a safe, secure and productive environment for our employees, customers, and visitors. Our global health and safety policy outlines our commitment to employees. Employees working in our research facilities receive specialized, role-specific health and safety training. The Company takes measures to reduce employee exposure to potential health hazards in our offices and research facilities and conducts regular inspections to maintain a safe and healthy work environment. A risk management system also provides technicians with additional data and information on the potential hazards associated with certain chemicals. In fiscal year 2021, we had no monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with employee health and safety violations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a response plan that we believe was in the best interest of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. This included transitioning the majority of our global workforce to a remote work model, while establishing preventative measures to ensure essential on-site employees could safely perform their jobs. Recognizing that the pandemic placed unanticipated demands on all our employees, we also launched initiatives to help people feel connected, and continued to support our local communities in a time of need.
