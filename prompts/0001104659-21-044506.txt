ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Urban One, Inc. (a Delaware corporation originally formed in 1980 and hereinafter referred to as “Urban One”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) is an urban-oriented, multi-media company that primarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets African-American and urban listeners. As of December 31, 2020, we owned and/or operated 63 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 54 FM or AM stations, 7 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate) located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. While a core source of our revenue has historically been and remains the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to operate the premier multi-media entertainment and information content provider targeting African-American and urban consumers. Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments in other complementary media properties. Our diverse media and entertainment interests include TV One, LLC (“TV One”), an African-American targeted cable television network; our 80.0% ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. (“Reach Media”), which operates the Rickey Smiley Morning Show and our other syndicated programming assets, including the Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell Show, Russ Parr Morning Show and the DL Hughley Show; and Interactive One, LLC (“Interactive One”), our wholly owned digital platform serving the African-American community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including its Cassius and Bossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire digital platforms and brands. We also hold a minority ownership interest in MGM National Harbor Casino, a gaming resort located in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Through our national multi-media operations, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to the African-American and urban audiences.
 
Our core radio broadcasting franchise operates under the brand “Radio One.”  We also operate our other brands, such as TV One, Reach Media and Interactive One, while developing additional branding reflective of our diverse media operations and targeting our African-American and urban audiences.
 
Recent Developments
 
Impact of Public Health Crisis
 
Throughout 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on certain of our revenue and alternative revenue sources. Most notably, a number of advertisers across significant advertising categories reduced advertising spend due to the outbreak. This was particularly true within our radio segment which derives substantial revenue from local advertisers, including in areas such as Texas, Ohio and Georgia. The economies in these areas were hit particularly hard due to social distancing and other government interventions. Further, the COVID-19 outbreak caused the postponement of our 2020 Tom Joyner Foundation Fantastic Voyage cruise and impaired ticket sales of other tent pole special events, some of which we had to cancel. We do not carry business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that occurred in 2020 and such losses may continue to occur as a result of the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outbreaks in the markets in which we operate could have material impacts on our liquidity, operations including potential impairment of assets, and our financial results. Likewise, our income from our investment in MGM National Harbor Casino has been negatively affected by closures and limitations on occupancy imposed by state and local governmental authorities.
 
We anticipate continued decreases in revenues due to ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As such, we assessed our operations considering a variety of factors, including but not limited to, media industry financial reforecasts, expected operating results, estimated net cash flows from operations, future obligations and liquidity, capital expenditure commitments and projected debt covenant compliance.  If we had been unable to meet financial covenants under certain of our debt instruments outstanding in 2020, an event of default could have occurred and our debt could have been required to be classified as current, which we could have been unable to repay if lenders were to call the debt.

To address the matter, we proactively implemented certain cost-cutting measures including furloughs, layoffs, salary reductions, other expense reduction (including eliminating travel and entertainment expenses), eliminating merit raises, decreasing or deferring marketing spend, deferring programming/production costs, reducing special events costs, and implementing a hiring freeze on open positions. Further, out of an abundance of caution and to provide for further liquidity given the uncertainty around the pandemic, we drew approximately $27.5 million on our ABL Facility (as defined below) on March 19, 2020. As operating conditions improved throughout the year, we were able to accumulate cash and all amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility (as defined below) were repaid on December 22, 2020, and as of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding. Finally in January 2021, we refinanced our debt to include less restrictive terms in certain instances, which we anticipate providing greater operating flexibility (See 2028 Notes Offering below).
 
On November 9, 2020, we completed an exchange of 99.15% of our outstanding 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the “7.375% Notes”) for $347 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due December 2022 (the “8.75% Notes”) (the “Exchange Offer”). In connection with the Exchange Offer, we also entered into an amendment to certain terms of our 2018 Credit Facility (as defined below) including the extension of the maturity date of the 2018 Credit Facility to March 31, 2023. (See 2028 Notes Offering below).
 
On November 6, 2020, we announced that we had signed a definitive asset exchange agreement with Entercom Communications Corp. pursuant to which we will receive the following Charlotte stations:  WLNK-FM (Adult Contemporary); WBT-AM & FM (News Talk Radio); and WFNZ-AM & 102.5 FM Translator (Sports Radio).  As part of the transaction, we will transfer three radio stations to Entercom: St. Louis, WHHL-FM (Urban Contemporary); Philadelphia, WPHI-FM (Urban Contemporary); and Washington, DC, WTEM-AM (Sports); as well as the intellectual property to its St. Louis radio station, WFUN-FM (Adult Urban Contemporary).  The deal is subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) approval and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close early in the second quarter. We also concurrently sold the remaining WFUN-FM assets in a separate transaction.
 
On December 19, 2019, we entered into both an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) and a time brokerage agreement (“TBA”) with Guardian Enterprise Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “GEG”) with respect to the acquisition and interim operation of low power television station WQMC-LD in Columbus, Ohio. Pursuant to the TBA, in January 2020, we began to operate WQMC-LD until such time as the purchase transaction could close under the APA after approval by the FCC. Under the terms of the TBA, we paid a monthly fee as well as certain operating costs of WQMC-LD, and, in exchange, we retained all revenues from the sale of the advertising within the programming. After receipt of FCC approval, we closed the transactions under the APA and took ownership of WQMC-LD on February 24, 2020.
 
On October 20, 2011, we entered into TBA with WGPR, Inc. (“WGPR”). Pursuant to the TBA, on October 24, 2011, we began to broadcast programs produced, owned or acquired by the Company on WGPR’s Detroit radio station, WGPR-FM. We paid a monthly fee as well as certain operating costs of WGPR-FM, and, in exchange, we retained all revenues from the sale of the advertising within the programming we provided. The original term of the TBA was through December 31, 2014; however, in September 2014, we entered into an amendment to the TBA to extend the term of the TBA through December 31, 2019 on which date we ceased operation of the station on our behalf. While we ceased operations of the station on December 31, 2019, the Company continues to provide management services to the current owner and operator of WGPR.
 
On August 31, 2019, the Company closed on its previously announced sale of assets of its Detroit, Michigan radio station, WDMK-FM and three translators W228CJ, W252BX, and W260CB for approximately $13.5 million to Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. The Company recognized an immaterial loss on the sale of the station during the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
On January 19, 2019, the Company launched CLEO TV, a lifestyle and entertainment network targeting Millennial and Gen X women of color. CLEO TV offers quality content that defies negative and cultural stereotypes of today’s modern women. The results of CLEO TV’s operations will be reflected in the Company’s cable television segment.

On January 17, 2019, the Company announced that it had given the required notice (“2020 Redemption Notice”) under the indenture governing its 9.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) to redeem for cash all outstanding aggregate principal amount of its Notes to the extent outstanding on February 15, 2019 (the “Redemption Date”). The redemption price for the 2020 Notes was 100.0% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date.
 
On December 4, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (“2018 Credit Facility”), among the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time, Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, and TCG Senior Funding L.L.C., as sole lead arranger and sole book-runner. The 2018 Credit Facility, provided $192.0 million in term loan borrowings. Concurrently, on December 4, 2018, Urban One Entertainment SPV, LLC and its immediate parent, Radio One Entertainment Holdings, LLC, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement, providing $50.0 million in term loan borrowings (the “MGM National Harbor Loan”). The net proceeds of term loan borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility and the MGM National Harbor Loan were used to refinance and redeem substantially all of the Company’s outstanding 2020 Notes. Simultaneously with entry into the 2018 Credit Facility and the MGM National Harbor Loan, the Company announced the launch of a cash tender offer for any and all of its 2020 Notes. Under the Tender Offer, the Company accepted for purchase $213,255,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes, and paid for such 2020 Notes on December 20, 2018. Concurrently with that settlement, the Company also repurchased at par of approximately $29.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes from certain lenders under the new credit facilities. Immediately following these settlements, approximately $2.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes remained outstanding. Such 2020 Notes were the subject of the 2020 Redemption Notice described above. (The 2018 Credit Facility and MGM National Harbor Loan are more fully described in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements — Long-Term Debt.)
 
PPP Loans
 
On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed into law. The legislation creates a second round of Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans of up to $2 million available to businesses with 300 or fewer employees that have sustained a 25% revenue loss in any quarter of 2020. Certain of the new PPP provisions may benefit broadcasters such as the Company. The provisions (i) allow individual TV and radio stations to apply for PPP loans as long as the individual TV or radio station employs not more than 300 employees per physical location; (ii) permit the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) to make loans up to $10 million total across TV and radio stations owned by a station group; (iii) require newly eligible individual TV and radio stations to make a good faith certification that proceeds of the loan will be used to support expenses for the production or distribution of locally-focused or emergency information; and (iv) waive any prohibition on loans to broadcast stations owned by publicly traded entities.  On January 29, 2021, the Company submitted an application for participation in the PPP loan program. There is no guarantee that the Company will be awarded any loan monies. While certain of the loans may be forgivable, to the extent the Company is awarded the loans the amount may constitute debt under the 2028 Notes (as defined below) and increase the Company’s leverage prior to repayment or forgiveness.
 
2028 Notes Offering
 
On January 7, 2021, the Company launched an offering (the “2028 Notes Offering”) of $825 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2028 Notes are general senior secured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain of the Company’s direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries.  The 2028 Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and interest on the Notes accrues and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2021 at the rate of 7.375% per annum. On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with respect to the 2028 Notes at an issue price of 100% and the 2028 Notes Offering closed on January 25, 2021.
 
The Company used the net proceeds from the 2028 Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, to repay or redeem (1) the loans outstanding under that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of April 18, 2017, by and among the Company, various lenders party thereto, Guggenheim Securities Credit Partners, LLC, as administrative agent, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as collateral agent (the “2017 Credit Facility”), (2) the 2018 Credit Facility, (3) the MGM National Harbor Loan; (4) the remaining amounts of our 7.375% Notes, and (5) our 8.75% Notes that were issued in the November 2020 Exchange Offer. Upon settlement of the 2028 Notes Offering, the 2017 Credit Facility, the 2018 Credit Facility and the MGM National Harbor Loan were terminated and the indentures governing the 7.375% Notes and the 8.75% Notes were satisfied and discharged.

Segments
 
As part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected financial information on the Company’s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) cable television; (iii) Reach Media; and (iv) digital.
Our Radio Station Portfolio, Strategy and Markets
 
As noted above, our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation in the country primarily targeting African-American and urban listeners. Within the markets in which we operate, we strive to build clusters of radio stations with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the African-American population. This clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration within the distinct segments of our overall target market. In addition, we have been able to achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses. Depending on market conditions, changes in ratings methodologies and economic and demographic shifts, from time to time, we may reprogram some of our stations in underperforming segments of certain markets.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we owned and/or operated 63 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 54 FM or AM stations, 7 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate but excluding translators) located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. The following tables set forth further selected information about our portfolio of radio stations as of December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 34.7% of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media. Within our core radio business, four (Houston, Washington, DC, Atlanta and Baltimore) of the 14 markets in which we operated radio stations throughout 2020 or a portion thereof accounted for approximately 55.0% of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from both the Houston and Washington, DC markets accounted for approximately 18.0% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from the four significant contributing radio markets, accounted for approximately 27.2% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Adverse events or conditions (economic, including government cutbacks or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or more of the four significant contributing radio markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations.
 
Radio Advertising Revenue
 
Substantially all net revenue generated from our radio franchise is generated from the sale of local, national and network advertising. Local sales are made by the sales staff located in our markets. National sales are made primarily by Katz Communications, Inc. (“Katz”), a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level. Katz is paid agency commissions on the advertising sold. Approximately 53.2% of our net revenue from our core radio business for the year ended December 31, 2020, was generated from the sale of local advertising and 45.3% from sales to national advertisers, including network/syndication advertising. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment is primarily derived from tower rental income, ticket sales, and revenue related to sponsored events, management fees and other alternative revenue.
 
Advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on:
 

· | a radio station’s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the supply and demand for radio advertising time.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
A radio station’s listenership is measured by the Portable People MeterTM (the “PPMTM”) system or diary ratings surveys, both of which estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station. Ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations, and are used by us to chart audience size, set advertising rates and adjust programming. Advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours.

Cable Television, Reach Media and Digital Segments, Strategy and Sources of Revenue and Income
 
We have expanded our operations to include other media forms that are complementary to our core radio business. In a strategy similar to our radio market segmentation, we have multiple complementary media and online brands. Each of these brands focuses upon a different segment of African-American consumers. With our multiple brands, we are able to direct advertisers to specific audiences within the urban communities in which we are located or to bundle the brands for advertising sales purposes when advantageous.
 
TV One, our cable television franchise targeting the African-American and urban communities, derives its revenue from advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of television air time to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements are run. TV One also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various affiliation agreements based upon a per subscriber fee multiplied by the most recent subscriber counts reported by the applicable affiliate. In January 2019, we launched CLEO TV, a lifestyle and entertainment network targeting Millennial and Gen X women of color. CLEO TV derives its revenue principally from advertising.
 
Reach Media, our syndicated radio unit, primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell, the Russ Parr Morning Show, and the DL Hughley Show. In addition to being broadcast on 50 Urban One stations, our syndicated radio programming also was available on over 205 non-Urban One stations throughout the United States as of December 31, 2020.
 
We have launched websites that simultaneously stream radio station content for each of our radio stations, and we derive revenue from the sale of advertisements on those websites. We generally encourage our web advertisers to run simultaneous radio campaigns and use mentions in our radio airtime to promote our websites. By providing streaming, we have been able to broaden our listener reach, particularly to “office hour” listeners. We believe streaming has had a positive impact on our radio stations’ reach to listeners. In addition, our station websites link to our other online properties operated by our primary digital unit, Interactive One. Interactive One operates the largest social networking site primarily targeting African-Americans and other branded websites, including Bossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire. Interactive One derives revenue from advertising services on non-radio station branded websites, and studio services where Interactive One provides services to other publishers. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising revenue is recognized either as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered, when “click through” purchases are made, or ratably over the contract period, where applicable. In addition, Interactive One derives revenue from its studio operations which provide third-party clients with digital platforms and expertise. In the case of the studio operations, revenue is recognized primarily through fixed contractual monthly fees and/or as a share of the third party’s reported revenue.
 
Finally, our MGM National Harbor investment entitles us to an annual cash distribution based on net gaming revenue. Future opportunities could include investments in, or acquisitions of, companies in diverse media businesses, gaming and entertainment, music production and distribution, movie distribution, internet-based services, and distribution of our content through emerging distribution systems such as the Internet, smartphones, cellular phones, tablets, and the home entertainment market.
 
Competition
 
The media industry is highly competitive and we face intense competition across our core radio franchise and all of our complementary media properties. Our media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as broadcast and cable television, the Internet, satellite radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail and outdoor advertising, some of which may be controlled by horizontally-integrated companies. Audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net revenue in that market. If a competing radio station converts to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its signal or operations, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue. Other media companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter or increase their presence in markets or segments in which we operate. Although we believe our media properties are well positioned to compete, we cannot assure that our properties will maintain or increase their current ratings, market share or advertising revenue.

Providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business. Our digital and cable television segments compete for the time and attention of internet users and viewers and, thus, advertisers and advertising revenues with a wide range of internet companies such as AmazonTM, NetflixTM, Yahoo!TM, GoogleTM, and MicrosoftTM, with social networking sites such as FacebookTM and with traditional media companies, which are increasingly offering their own digital products and services both organically and through acquisition. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of content, sale of commercial time on our digital and cable television networks and viewership. There is competition from other digital companies, production studios and other television networks for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.
 
Our TV One and CLEO TV networks compete with other television networks for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.
 
Our networks and digital products compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.
 
Federal Antitrust Laws
 
The agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, may investigate certain acquisitions. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific FTC or Department of Justice investigation. Any decision by the FTC or the Department of Justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the FTC and the Department of Justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition.
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
 
The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC and other federal agencies of ownership, programming, technical operations, employment and other business practices. The FCC regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Communications Act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. Among other things, the FCC:

· | assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting;
--+------------------------------------------------

 
13

 


· | determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating power, interference standards, and other technical parameters for radio broadcast stations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adopts and implements regulations and policies that affect the ownership, operation, program content, employment, and business practices of radio broadcast stations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of an FCC license, or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee, without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license or consent to assignment or transfer of a license, the FCC considers a number of factors, including restrictions on foreign ownership, compliance with FCC media ownership limits and other FCC rules, the character and other qualifications of the licensee (or proposed licensee) and compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A licensee’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of a license renewal for less than a full eight-year term or with conditions, denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license, and/or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties.
 
Congress, the FCC and, in some cases, other federal agencies and local jurisdictions are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include or may include:
 

· | changes to the license authorization and renewal process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | proposals to increase record keeping, including enhanced disclosure of stations’ efforts to serve the public interest;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes to rules relating to political broadcasting, including proposals to grant free air time to candidates, and other changes regarding political and non-political program content, political advertising rates and sponsorship disclosures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | revised rules and policies regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent content;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | technical and frequency allocation matters;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | changes in broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution policies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14

 


· | legislation that would provide for the payment of sound recording royalties to artists, musicians or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | changes to tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FCC also has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations.
 
We cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted or considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business.
 
FCC License Grants and Renewals. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant’s legal, technical, character and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the Communications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years.
 
Generally, the FCC renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that:
 

· | the radio station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
After considering these factors and any petitions to deny a license renewal application (which may lead to a hearing), the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, our licenses have been renewed for full eight-year terms without any conditions or sanctions; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions.
 
Types of FCC Broadcast Licenses. The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A clear channel serves wide areas, particularly at night. A regional channel serves primarily a principal population center and the contiguous rural areas. A local channel serves primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it. AM radio stations are designated as Class A, Class B, Class C or Class D. Class A, B and C stations each operate unlimited time. Class A radio stations render primary and secondary service over an extended area. Class B stations render service only over a primary service area. Class C stations render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. Class D stations operate either during daytime hours only, during limited times only, or unlimited time with low nighttime power.
 
FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM radio station are determined by its class. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C. The FCC has adopted a rule subjecting Class C FM stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to Class C0 under certain circumstances.
 
Urban One’s Licenses. The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we hold the license as of December 31, 2020. Stations which we do not own as of December 31, 2020, but operate under an LMA, are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The coverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio stations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the ERP of the radio station’s antenna and the HAAT of the radio station’s antenna. “ERP” refers to the effective radiated power of an FM radio station. “HAAT” refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an FM radio station.

To obtain the FCC’s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, an appropriate application must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer of more than 50% of the voting stock, the applicant must give public notice and the application is subject to a 30-day period for public comment. During this time, interested parties may file petitions with the FCC to deny the application. Informal objections may be filed at any time until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, administrative procedures provide for petitions seeking reconsideration or full FCC review of the grant. The Communications Act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court.
 
Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any person who is not a U.S. citizen or by any entity that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, or by foreign governments or their representatives. The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by such prohibition. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before this 25% limit may be exceeded. Since we serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that serve as licensees for our stations, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives, foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments, or foreign business entities unless we seek and obtain FCC authority to exceed that level. The FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees.
 
The FCC applies its media ownership limits to “attributable” interests. The interests of officers, directors and those who directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total outstanding voting stock of a corporation that holds a broadcast license (or a corporate parent) are generally deemed attributable interests, as are any limited partnership or limited liability company interests that are not properly “insulated” from management activities. Certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only are deemed attributable with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of a licensee or parent corporation. An entity with one or more radio stations in a market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station if the brokering station supplies programming for more than 15% of the brokered radio station’s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station licensee’s right under a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules. Debt instruments, non-voting stock, unexercised options and warrants, minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder, and limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company pursuant to FCC-prescribed “insulation” provisions, generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the FCC’s equity-debt-plus (or “EDP”) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or the holder of an attributable interest in a same-market radio station, television station or daily newspaper will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are “insulated” from material involvement in the company’s media activities. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15% of the station’s weekly programming hours.
 
17

 

The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in, radio broadcast stations serving the same local market in excess of specified numerical limits.
 
The numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market are as follows:
 

· | in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in a radio market with 30 to 44 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in a radio market with 15 to 29 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not hold an attributable interest in more than 50% of the radio stations in such market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on a contour-overlap methodology. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to determine how to define local radio markets in areas located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In 2003, when the FCC changed its methodology for defining local radio markets, it grandfathered existing combinations of radio stations that would not comply with the modified rules. The FCC provided that these grandfathered combinations could not be sold intact except to certain “eligible entities,” which the FCC defined as entities qualifying as a small business consistent with Small Business Administration standards. In response to a federal appeals court decision, the FCC repealed the eligible entity standard in December 2019.
 
FCC rules currently in effect also limit the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned (or in which common attributable interests may be held) with television stations in the same market, and generally prohibit the common ownership (or common attributable interests) in a radio station and a daily newspaper in the same market.
 
The media ownership rules are subject to review by the FCC every four years. In August 2016, the FCC issued an order concluding its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. The August 2016 decision retained the local radio ownership rule, the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the prohibition on newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership without significant changes. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order reconsidering the August 2016 decision and modifying it in a number of respects. The November 2017 order on reconsideration did not significantly modify the August 2016 decision with respect to the local radio ownership limits. It did, however, eliminate the FCC’s previous limits on radio/television cross-ownership and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership effective February 7, 2018. In September 2019, however, a federal appeals court vacated the FCC’s November 2017 order on reconsideration, as a result of which the radio/television and newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules have been reinstated. The U.S. Supreme Court has granted certiorari to review the September 2019 appeals court ruling, and a decision is expected in 2021. The FCC’s 2018 quadrennial review of its media ownership rules, which commenced in December 2018, is currently pending.

The attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell. The FCC’s rules could affect our business in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

· | the FCC’s radio ownership limits could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single entity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restricting the assignment and transfer of control of “grandfathered” radio combinations that exceed the ownership limits as a result of the FCC’s 2003 change in local market definition could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in general terms, future changes in the way the FCC defines radio markets or in the numerical station caps could limit our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets, our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements, and our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming and Operations. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest” by presenting programming that responds to community problems, needs and interests and by maintaining records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from viewers or listeners about a broadcast station’s programming. All radio stations are now required to maintain their public inspection files on a publicly accessible FCC-hosted online database. Moreover, the FCC has proposed rules designed to increase local programming content and diversity, including renewal application processing guidelines for locally-oriented programming and a requirement that broadcasters establish advisory boards in the communities where they own stations. Stations also must follow FCC rules and policies regulating political advertising, obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, contests and lotteries and technical operation, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation.
 
The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time employees to broadly disseminate information about all full-time job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships, or scholarship programs. The FCC is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part-time employment positions. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites.
 
From time to time, complaints may be filed against any of our radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules. In addition, the FCC may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Failure to observe these or other rules and regulations can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including fines or conditions, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum eight year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 753 full-time employees and 459 part-time employees. Our employees are not unionized.
 
Environmental
 
As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures in the future.
