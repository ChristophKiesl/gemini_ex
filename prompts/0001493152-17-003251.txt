Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on March 2, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. On March 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to the Certificate of Incorporation to correct our name to Hubilu Venture Corporation from Hubilu Venture Corp. On March 5, 2015, our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to provide consulting and advisory services to real estate professionals and investors to assist them in finding properties and evaluating them for purchase or leasing. We are not a real estate brokerage firm and do not engage in real estate brokerage activities. Our services are focused on the research and analysis of real estate properties and advising clients on the best use of their real estate assets. We are also seeking to raise funds to invest in real estate assets and have signed non-binding letters of intent to acquire to rental properties.
 
On March 5, 2015, we issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.001 per share, to our founder, David Behrend for $75,000 in cash or $0.003 per share. On April 30, 2015, Mr. Behrend transferred his shares to Jacaranda Investments, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, which he owns 100% of, in exchange for 30,000 shares of Jacaranda’s common shares. From April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015, we sold and issued 235,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for $23,500 to 40 accredited investors. On May 4, 2015, we issued 191,500 shares of our common stock, valued by our sole director at $0.10 per share, or $19,150, to 12 individuals for services rendered to us. Six of these individuals had already purchased shares of our common stock at the price of $0.10 per share. On October 1, 2016, we issued 100,000 shares to 5 individuals for share-based compensation, valued by our sole director at $0.10 per share, for compensation of $50,000 for services rendered to us by them. Presently, we estimate our monthly burn rate is approximately $15,000 per month, which consists of general and administrative expenses and professional fees. We believe that our present capital is insufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. We believe that we will require approximately $190,000 in either cash or our common stock to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation, which we intend for fund from the recent sale of our common stock as well as advances from our majority shareholder, which has - agreed to advance our working capital, if necessary. We also intend to use our common stock to accomplish these goals to conserve our cash if we can negotiate the payment for services with our shares. To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the issuance of common stock for services and products, then we use our capital or we will borrow funds from our majority shareholder, which has agreed to advance us the necessary working capital.

Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 205 South Beverly Drive, Suite 205, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 and our telephone number is (310) 308-7887 and email contact is info@hubilu.com. Our URL address is www.hubilu.com.
 
Business
 
We are a real estate consulting and acquisition firm that commenced operations in March 5, 2015, and, until June 2015, was limited to organizational and business development activities. In June 2015, we entered into our first consulting agreement with a client. In 2016, we entered into another consulting agreement. We are real estate advisory and consulting company that assists real estate investor professionals, as well as established companies, with advisory and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis and acquisition opportunities to them. Our mission is to assist investors and professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the evaluation of properties prior to them committing capital for the purchase or the leasing of real estate properties. We are focusing our marketing efforts in the commercial markets; however, we will also look at residential and income producing markets. We are using the Internet as well as the services of independent sales consultants to market our services to investors and professionals in Southern California with our main efforts focused in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. We have had minimal operations and have limited financial resources. Our financial statements include disclosure indicating the Company’s lack of business operations and early losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations have been devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities, which include:

1. | Formation of the Company; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Development of our business plan; 
3. | Evaluating various target real estate professionals and investors to market our services; 
4. | Research on marketing channels/strategies for our services; 
5. | Secured our website domain www.hubilu.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and 
6. | Research on services and the pricing of our services. 

 
Commencing in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property. We were in negotiations with Camden Realty Group, a real estate brokerage firm, to provide consulting services to it and to have it provide brokerage services to our clients. We have discontinued these discussions; instead, we will determine, on a case by case basis, which real estate firm to use for each particular client or acquisition.
 
We are offering services to investors and professionals with the mission to assist them in investment and property evaluation strategies and provide hands-on support to reduce evaluation time and resources and increase the speed for them to determine whether to proceed with a real estate lease or investment. Besides general property evaluation services, we offer services to assist the principals with property development ideas and investment structure.
 
Our goal is to assist investors by providing them with the property opportunities, analysis and guidance to enhance their ability to purchase or lease real estate. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer brokerage services. We are targeting buyers of properties and property owners in Southern California. We are also evaluating real estate acquisitions for ourselves and have signed non-binding letters of intent to acquire to rental properties from related parties.
 
On January 5, 2017, we executed a non-binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to acquire Nationwide Open MRI Diagnostics, LLC solely owned by 1125 North Vermont LLC (the “Target”) for a purchase price of $1,100,000 in cash and our convertible preferred stock. The Target has been operating since 2014. The Target is in Los Angeles, adjacent the Los Angeles Metro system, several area hospitals and medical offices. The Target has newly remodeled facilities with plenty of room to add additional modalities and services, utilizes state-of-the-art equipment and offers comprehensive diagnostic services. We believe the Target’s operations offers superior customer service and has a great reputation with its clients throughout Southern California. The Target’s practice accepts many insurance providers, private pay patients and works with area attorneys on personal injury claims, injury referrals from area physicians, and workman’s compensation claims. We also have a four-year lease option to purchase the property located at 1125 N. Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California at the existing market rates and terms if we chose to exercise the option.
 
Under the terms of the LOI, the acquisition of the Target is subject to due diligence and other conditions. We believe the acquisition of the Target is beneficial for us to enable us to diversify our real estate acquisition business model by allowing us to enter the healthcare services industry. We also believe that the acquisition of the Target will increase our cash flow and, being adjacent to the Los Angeles Metro System, will allow us to grow into this sector through a roll-up strategy to acquire other similar healthcare service providers to capitalize on the baby boomer generation.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe the real estate consulting and advisory industries are sectors of the U.S. economy, which have seen increased activity since interest rates are at their current levels. We believe that an attractive opportunity exists for a public company focused on assisting real estate investors and users in evaluating real estate opportunities and we intend to provide services. We are focusing on the commercial and residential rental real estate market.

The total value of U.S. commercial real estate assets was estimated to be $12 trillion at the end of 2012. Property sales in the commercial real estate sector for properties priced at $1 million and above reached over $340 billion, or approximately 37,000 transactions, in 2012. This was a 41% increase in dollar volume and 32% increase in the number of transactions over 2011, following a 32% increase in dollar volume and an 18% increase in the number of transactions over 2010.
 
Historically, the U.S. commercial real estate industry has tended to be cyclical. The commercial real estate market experienced a significant downturn from the 2007 peak to a trough in 2009, representing the most severe downturn in property sales since at least 1990. Since 2009, commercial property sales for transactions of $1 million and above have increased by 97% and dollar volume has increased by 235%. Such property sales in 2012, however, were still 16% below the 2007 peak in number of transactions and 32% below the peak in dollar volume. This cyclical upturn has been, and we believe will continue to be, primarily driven by attractive yields, improving property fundamentals and the availability and cost of financing.
 
Attractive Yields. According to Real Capital Analytics, average commercial real estate yields (capitalization rates) for the four major property types currently range from 4.0% to 7.0%, which compare favorably to alternative investments such as stocks and bonds. We believe these attractive yields are a key driver of improving capital inflows for commercial real estate investments.
 
Improving Property Fundamentals. Property fundamentals have improved since 2009, with multifamily properties experiencing a strong recovery. We expect further increases in occupancy and rental rates in all four primary commercial real estate sectors of multifamily, retail, office and industrial properties.
 
Availability and Cost of Financing. The availability and low cost of debt financing has been a significant contributor to the recent improvement in the U.S. capital markets and the U.S. commercial real estate market. Low interest rates and improved access to capital are key factors fueling investment sales activity.
 
We analyze and intend to segment the commercial real estate market into three major segments by investment size and focus primarily on the private client segment:
 

● | Private client segment: properties with prices under $10 million; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hybrid segment: properties with prices equal to or greater than $10 million and less than $20 million; and 
● | Institutional segment: properties with prices of $20 million and above. 

 
We are focusing our business on the private client segment, as we believe it represents the largest and most active market segment in the commercial real estate investment industry. We believe private clients, many of whom are individuals and partnerships, are impacted by life or partnership changes that often override market and macroeconomic conditions. Due to these personal and partnership drivers, we believe properties in this segment exhibit a high turnover rate. We believe private clients often take advantage of rising prices to dispose of assets, refinance, acquire and/or exchange assets into new opportunities. The attractive financial results for property investment provide the opportunity for redeployment of capital, which supports a high number of sales transactions. Additionally, the private client segment is highly fragmented with many buyers, sellers and properties in different geographic regions and sectors.
 
We believe it is also the most underserved market segment and intend to offer our consulting services to private clients. We believe our competition will come from brokerage firms, consulting departments of accounting and consulting firms and other real estate advisory firms.
 
Our Business Strategy 
 
Our goal is to consult with real estate investors and professionals, as well as companies, by providing consulting and advisory services, which will allow the investors to focus on their core businesses. We believe that by consulting with investors prior to retaining a broker, we will generate client loyalty while we add value for our potential clients. The following are key elements of our strategy:

● | Guide our clients through the challenges of early analysis. We intend to help provide our clients with the research and analysis to minimize their time to evaluate properties. We believe that our services will reduce time, costs and accelerate the time to enable the client to purchase or lease real estate without the pressure of commission sales professionals. We believe that we can advise them by providing strategic guidance, access to local market intelligence and opportunities that may not exist through traditional listing services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Apply a structured consulting process to our clients. Web-based technology is becoming increasingly capital-efficient, and our model is optimized to leverage this trend using the Internet and various online research tools. By advising clients in the earliest stages of their evaluation of potential investments, we believe that we will allow them to achieve desired returns without the sales pressure or commissions associated with typical real estate transactions. We intend to use web-based applications to enable us to assist our clients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consult to diverse, innovative and dynamic clients. We believe that the low capital requirements to consult with our target clients, coupled with the various timelines of real estate investors, enable us to spread our resources across a wide spectrum of clients. Some clients will be interested in leasing while others will be interested in purchasing or pursuing joint ventures. By diversifying our target clients, we believe we will mitigate risk and enhance the value of our services to our clients. 

 
We intend to provide consulting and advisory services to our clients for fee-based compensation. We will negotiate our fees on a case-by-case basis and intend to offer hourly rates and flat fees for our services.
 
We will provide a variety of services to client companies, including the following:
 

● | Analysis of current trends and transactions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consulting on structure and financing including corporate formation services; 
● | Investment analysis of properties; 
● | Marketing, branding and public relations with respect to leasing and branding; 
● | Formulating operating strategies for the properties; 
● | Formulating other strategies designed to maximize property values, including tenant analysis; 
● | Relocation services; 
● | Introductions to potential joint venture partners; and 
● | Assisting in financial modeling. 

 
We intend to derive income from our clients for the performance of these services. We also intend to acquire and operating residential rental properties and derive income from management fees and operating income.
 
Since March 2, 2015 (our Date of Incorporation) to December 31, 2016, we generated $4,300 revenues and have a net loss of $305,319. In June 2015, our first client retained us. We have provided consulting services for 2 clients and are now seeking real estate acquisitions. We anticipate that we will generate revenues as we secure additional clients and acquire properties in the next twelve months. We have signed non-binding letters of intent to acquire 2 rental properties. The closing of these contemplated transactions is subject to due diligence and the completion of audits of the subject entities that own the properties. We do not believe that we have sufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next 12 months; however, our majority shareholder has agreed to advance us our necessary working capital, if necessary. We currently have two officers and a sole director. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and devote approximately 40 hours per week to us.
 
As of the date of this Report, we have 25,526,500 shares of $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding, which is owned by 51 shareholders. We have 10,400 shares of our Series 1 convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding. The aggregate market value of our common stock based on the offering price of $0.20 per share is $5,105,000. Our stockholders’ deficit as of our most recent audit, which is December 31, 2016, is $177,669.
 
Principal Services
 
We offer consulting services to real estate users and investors and assist them with a variety of consulting and analytical services. We also advise them about the possibilities of raising capital, and seeking strategic market opportunities.
 
Potential clients may face several options when seeking advice for the capital markets and we intend to advise them in of various options, providing them with the administrative support, and help prepare them to be ready to present to potential investors, strategic partners and customers.

Competition
 
The real estate advisory and consulting services industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as real estate brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, consultants as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us.
 
The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of service, the quality of work product the clients desire and price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality services depends primarily on the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver our services in an effective and timely manner. We believe we will compete effectively in these areas.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors can obtain more experienced employees than we can.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property rights.

Need for any Government Approval of Principal Services
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Sales of the services we intend to provide to customers may be subject to U.S. and local government regulations.

HUBILU VENTURE CORPORATION
 Notes to the Financial Statements
 December 31, 2016
 
NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS
 


Hubilu Venture Corporation (“the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 2, 2015, under the name Hubilu Venture Corporation and, on March 4, 2015, filed a Certificate of Correction to change the name to Hubilu Venture Corporation. The Company had limited operations until June 2015 and since then is implementing a business plan to provide real estate consulting services to clients in the United States as well as raise capital to make real estate acquisitions. From March 2015 to June 2015, its business activities were limited to organizational matters and developing a website. In June 2015, the Company signed its first client and began generating revenues from its planned operations. The Company is currently seeking the acquisition of rental properties and has signed letters of intent to acquire two rental properties from a related party.
NOTE 2 – ABILTIY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN
 


These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these consolidated financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, has incurred cumulative losses of $305,319 and expects to incur significant further losses in the development of its business, which casts substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. To remain a going concern, the Company will be required to obtain the necessary financing to pursue its plan of operation. Management plans to obtain the necessary financing through the issuance of equity and/or advances from related parties. Should the Company not be able to obtain this financing, it may need to substantially scale back operations or cease business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 


Use of Estimates and Assumptions
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company does not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Change in Classification of Certain Expenses
 
Certain of the prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the current year financial statement presentation.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year; and, (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

---


A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken may be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable upon examination, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position under ASC 740-10 would equal the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all the relevant information. A liability (including interest and penalties, if applicable) is established to the extent a current benefit has been recognized on a tax return for matters that are considered contingent upon the outcome of an uncertain tax position. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have analyzed filing positions in each of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have identified the U.S. federal and California as our “major” tax jurisdictions. Generally, we remain subject to Internal Revenue Service examination of our 2015 and Delaware and California Franchise Tax Returns. However, we have certain tax attribute carry forwards, which will remain subject to review and adjustment by the relevant tax authorities until the statute of limitations closes with respect to the year in which such attributes are utilized. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax position have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. Related interest and penalties, if any, are included as components of income tax expense and income taxes payable.
 
Loss per Share
 
The Company’s basic loss per share are calculated by dividing its net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company’s dilutive loss per share is calculated by dividing its net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The book value of cash, accounts payable and related party advances approximate their fair value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 due to the short maturity of these financial instruments.
 
ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 

● | Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
● | Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

 
The fair value of the Company’s Series 1 Convertible Preferred shares are determined using Level 2 inputs in the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy. As at December 31, 2016, these shares have a fair value of $11,556.
 
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company‘s financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an agreement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and goods have been delivered or services performed.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU outlines a comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and will apply to transactions such as the sale of real estate. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We plan to use the cumulative effect transition method upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2018, and do not expect this topic to have a material impact on the or on the disclosures.
 
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 (“ASU 2014-15”), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This new guidance requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter and early adoption is permitted. The Company’s adoption of this guidance on December 31, 2016 did not have an impact to the financial statements or material impact on its disclosures.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 (“ASU 2016-01”), Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10) Recognition and measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities. The new standard’s applicable provisions to the Company include an elimination of the disclosure requirement of the significant inputs and assumptions underlying the fair value calculations of its financial instruments which are carried at amortized cost. The standard is effective on January 1, 2018, and early adoption is not permitted for the applicable provision. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will not impact the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”), Leases (ASC 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840 Leases. The standard is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the pending guidance but does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition, since the Company does not have a material amount of lease expense.
 
NOTE 4–DEPOSITS
 


Deposits consist of amounts paid in advance to the Company’s landlord as security for its lease. The balance as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is $6,600 and $0, respectively.


NOTE 5–SERIES 1 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES 
 


The Company has authorized and designated 2,000,000 shares of Series 1 convertible preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”). In September 2016, the Company issued 10,400 shares of Preferred Stock at an issuance price of $1.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $10,400.
 
The Preferred Stock has the following rights and privileges:
 
Voting – The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could be converted.

Conversion – Each share of Preferred Stock, is convertible at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock, at the lesser of $0.50 per share or a ten percent (10%) discount to the average closing bid price of the common stock 5 days prior to the notice of conversion. The Preferred Stock is also subject to certain adjustments for dilution, if any, resulting from future stock issuances, including for any subsequent issuance of common stock at a price per share less than that paid by the holders of the Preferred Stock.
 
Dividends – The holders of the Preferred Stock in preference to the holders of common stock, are entitled to receive, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, dividends at the rate of $0.05 per share per annum, in kind, which shall accrue quarterly. Such dividends are cumulative. No such dividends have been declared to date. In addition, the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive a dividend, in kind equal, to any dividend paid on common stock, when and if declared by the board, on the basis of the number of common shares into which a share of Preferred Stock may be convertible.
 
Liquidation – In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or sale or merger of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, each holder of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of common stock, a per-share amount equal to the original issue price of $1.00 (as adjusted, as defined), plus all declared but unpaid dividends.
 
The Preferred Stock matures on September 30, 2019.
 
The predominant settlement obligation of the Series 1 Convertible Preferred shares was considered to be the issuance of a variable number of shares to settle a fixed monetary amount. Thus, these shares are scoped into the guidance of ASC 480-10 and are accounted for as a liability as at December 31, 2016.
NOTE 6–INCOME TAXES
 


A reconciliation of the income tax provision computed at statutory rates to the reported income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

 | As of December 31, 2016 | | | As of December 31, 2015 | 
-------------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------+---+-------------------------+--
Statutory tax rate | | 34 | % | | | 34 | %
Net loss for the year before income taxes | $ | (212,564 | ) | | $ | (92,755 | )
Expected income tax recovery | | (72,000 | ) | | | (32,000 | )
Change in unrecognized deferred tax assets | | 72,000 | | | | 32,000 | 
Income tax expense | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
The significant components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities after applying enacted corporate tax rates at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
 

 | As of December 31, 2016 | | | As of December 31, 2015 | 
----------------------------------+-------------------------+----------+---+-------------------------+--
Deferred tax assets: | | | | | | | 
Net operating loss carry-forwards | $ | 104,000 | | | $ | 32,000 | 
Valuation allowance | | (104,000 | ) | | | (32,000 | )
Net deferred tax assets | $ | - | | | $ | - | 

 
At December 31, 2016, the Company has accumulated non-capital losses totaling $305,000, which may be available to carry forward and offset future years’ taxable income. The losses expire in various amounts starting in 2035.
 
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance.
