Item 1.     Business
Organization
Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or the “Company”) was incorporated on July 25, 2008 under the laws of the state of Maryland.
We have elected to be treated, and currently qualify, as a real estate investment trust (or “REIT”) for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain our REIT status, we are required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our “REIT taxable income,” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. We were incorporated to raise capital and acquire a diverse portfolio of residential real estate assets.
Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, all references to “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including, without limitation, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner, which we refer to as our Operating Partnership. We refer to Bluerock Real Estate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, and its affiliate, Bluerock Real Estate Holdings, LLC, together as Bluerock or BRE, and we refer to our former external manager, BRG Manager, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as our former Manager. Both Bluerock and our former Manager are affiliated with the Company. References to our shares of Class A common stock on a “fully diluted basis” includes all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, shares of our Class C common stock, units of limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership, or OP Units, and long-term incentive plan units in our Operating Partnership, or LTIP Units, whether vested or unvested.
On October 31, 2017, we became an internally-managed REIT as a result of the completion of the management internalization transactions (the “Internalization”), and we are no longer externally managed by our former Manager. The owners of the former Manager are referred to as the Contributors.
Substantially all our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership.
The principal executive offices of our Company and the former Manager are located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 32nd Floor, New York, New York 10105. Our telephone number is (212) 843-1601.
Investments in Real Estate
As of December 31, 2021, we held an aggregate of 20,263 units, comprised of 16,837 multifamily units and 3,426 single-family residential units. The aggregate number of units are held through seventy-eight real estate investments, consisting of forty-nine consolidated operating investments and twenty-nine investments held through preferred equity, loan or ground lease investments. As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated operating investments were approximately 95.9% occupied. For more information regarding our investments, see “Item 2. Properties”.
Proposed Merger
On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Badger Parent LLC (“Parent”) and Badger Merger Sub LLC (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were unanimously approved by the Board. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate Partners IX L.P., an affiliate of Blackstone Inc.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company Common Stock”), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into the right to receive $24.25 in cash, without interest (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”).

8



We will deliver a notice of redemption (the “Preferred Stock Redemption Notice”) to the holders of our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series B Preferred Stock”), 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series C Preferred Stock”), 7.125% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series D Preferred Stock”), and Series T Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series T Preferred Stock”), in accordance with their respective Articles Supplementary, in order to provide that such preferred stock will be redeemed effective as of the Effective Time. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series T Preferred Stock will be redeemed for an amount equal to $25.00 plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the redemption date set forth in the Preferred Stock Redemption Notice, without interest. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemed for an amount equal to $1,000.00 plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the redemption date set forth in the Preferred Stock Redemption Notice, without interest.
The outstanding warrants to purchase Class A common stock of the Company (the “Company Warrants”) will remain outstanding following the Effective Time in accordance with their terms, but the Exercise Price (as defined in the Warrant Agreements with respect to the Company Warrants) will be adjusted so that the holder of any Company Warrant exercised after the Effective Time will be entitled to receive in cash the amount of the Per Share Merger Consideration which, if the Company Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to the Closing, such holder would have been entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger.
In addition, each award of shares of restricted Class A common stock of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in an amount equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, we will complete the separation of our single-family residential real estate business (the “SFR Business”) from our multi-family residential real estate business (the “Separation”). Following the Separation, the SFR Business will be indirectly held by Bluerock Homes Trust, Inc. (“BHM”), a Maryland corporation, and the Operating Partnership, and, prior to the consummation of the Merger, we will distribute the common stock of BHM to our stockholders as of the record date for such distribution in a taxable distribution (the “Distribution”).
In connection with the Separation, the Operating Partnership will exchange its interests in an entity holding its multi-family residential real estate business with the Company as consideration for a redemption of all of our preferred interests in the Operating Partnership and a portion of our common units in the Operating Partnership (the “Redemption”). As a result, following the Redemption, the Operating Partnership will cease to hold interests in the Company’s multi-family residential real estate business, and will hold the assets related to the SFR Business. Most members of our senior management, along with certain entities related to them, have agreed to retain their interests in the Operating Partnership until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of the Merger Agreement, rather than redeeming their interests for cash or shares of Company Common Stock that will receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. As a result, following the Separation and the Distribution, our stockholders who receive shares of BHM in the Distribution are expected to indirectly own approximately 35% of the SFR Business, with holders of units in the Operating Partnership (other than BHM) expected to indirectly own an interest of approximately 65% of the SFR Business. In connection with the Separation and the Distribution, BHM and the Operating Partnership will enter into a management agreement with an affiliate of Bluerock providing for it to be externally managed thereby.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, among others, covenants by the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not subject to any financing condition or the receipt of any financing by Parent or Merger Sub.
The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the consummation of the Separation and the Distribution, as well as certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the Merger by the affirmative vote of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the Merger by the holders of issued and outstanding Company Common Stock (the “Company Requisite Vote”). The Merger Agreement requires the Company to convene a stockholders’ meeting for purposes of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote.

9



The Company has agreed not to solicit or enter into an agreement regarding a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and, subject to certain exceptions, is not permitted to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide information to a third party in connection with, any Company Takeover Proposal. However, the Company may, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, engage in discussions or negotiations and provide information to a third party which has made an unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicit provisions of the Merger Agreement if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board may, in certain circumstances, effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement), subject to complying with specified notice and other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances by the Company, including prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, if, after following certain procedures and adhering to certain restrictions, the Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Company Superior Proposal and the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Company Superior Proposal. In addition, Parent may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, including if the Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. The Merger Agreement also may be terminated by either the Company or Parent if the Merger has not been completed on or prior to the date that is nine months after the date of the Merger Agreement, which date may be extended to complete the Separation and the Distribution, by the Company, up to the date that is ten months after the date of the Merger Agreement, or by Parent, up to the date that is twelve months after the date of the Merger Agreement.
Upon a termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee to Parent of $60 million. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $200 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is only a summary, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 21, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Business and Growth Strategies
We are currently diversified through investments in both infill first-ring suburban single-family residential and high-quality multifamily properties.
The Separation of the Bluerock Homes Business from Bluerock Residential and the Distribution of shares of Bluerock Homes common stock is expected to enable Bluerock Homes to pursue our distinct business strategy focused on our single-family properties. Bluerock Homes and Bluerock Residential expect that the Separation and the Distribution will provide an opportunity for our experienced management team to implement and execute our growth strategy and for us to enhance investor transparency and better highlight our attributes by concentrating on investments in single-family residential.
Single-family residential
With respect to our investments in single-family residential properties, our principal business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted investment returns by assembling a portfolio of pre-existing single-family rental homes and developing build-to-rent communities located across a diverse group of growth markets. Our single-family rental properties will target a growing pool of middle-income renters seeking the single-family lifestyle without the upfront and ongoing investments associated with home ownership. By implementing our investment strategies and our institutional-quality management, we expect to be able to achieve sustainable long-term growth in both our FFO and NAV.

10



Value Creation Execution. We acquire single-family rental properties with potential for long-term value creation for our stockholders. We utilize the following internal and external growth strategies to drive growth in FFO and NAV for our investors:

● | Scattered-Site Aggregation. Currently, there is a high level of fragmentation in the single-family rental home market. We believe we can generate economies of scale and enable transaction efficiencies by targeting individual or small portfolios of quality, scattered, single-family rental homes with strong and stable cash flows and aggregate them into larger portfolios. We look for middle-market rents that deliver attractive unlevered yields relative to private market portfolio and public market dividend yields. To date, we have acquired scattered-site homes at year one nominal cap rates exceeding 5% and gross rental yields exceeding 9%. We see an opportunity to replicate this strategy across our markets utilizing our network as a force multiplier on the sourcing and execution fronts. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build-to-Rent. We develop build-to-rent communities at attractive stabilized unlevered yields, investing selectively in target markets that we believe will enable us to capture development premiums on completion. We may use a convertible loan or convertible preferred equity structure to provide income during the development stage and/or the ability to capture development premiums at completion by exercising our conversion rights to take ownership. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value-Add Renovation. We see significant potential for capital appreciation through renovation of existing assets. Our value-add strategy focuses on working with our local experts to reposition lower-quality, less current assets and drive rent growth and expand margins, increasing NOI and maximizing our return on investment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Institutional Property Management / NOI Margin Expansion. We expect to improve margins at our operating properties by deploying institutional management approaches across the portfolio —including professional management, investment in technology platforms, and leveraging economies of scale — to best position the portfolio for optimal rental growth. Through the aggregation of multiple scattered homes, we seek to address operational inefficiencies, revenue management and deferred capital maintenance at scale and to grow underlying cashflow through substantial NOI margin expansion at stabilized properties. We will also provide an aggressive asset management presence, working alongside our network partners to ensure optimal execution of the asset management plan, enabling us to drive rent growth and values. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology-Aided Platform. We have implemented a data warehouse, which provides us with real-time visibility into leasing, inventory, maintenance and renovation metrics allowing us to quickly react to changes in current operational performance and monitor trends across our portfolio. Further, we believe we will be able to utilize our data warehouse technology as a building block in the design and implementation of a portfolio-wide revenue management system to further drive NOI and margin expansion. In addition, we utilize various PropTech solutions to both acquire and maximize operational efficiency. Operational PropTech solutions include focus on streamlining value-add initiatives, integrating smart-home technology, automating the lease process and providing robust and coordinated maintenance services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harvest and Redeploy Capital Selectively. On an opportunistic basis and subject to compliance with REIT restrictions, we intend to sell properties when we have executed our value creation plans and when we believe the investment has limited additional upside relative to other opportunities. This allows us to harvest profits and reinvest proceeds to maximize stockholder value.
Multifamily communities
With respect to our investments in multifamily residential communities, our principal business objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted investment returns by assembling a high-quality portfolio of apartment properties located in demographically attractive growth markets and by implementing our investment strategies and our “Live/Work/Play Initiatives” to achieve sustainable long-term growth in both our core funds from operations and net asset value.
Invest in Institutional-Quality Apartment Properties.  We acquire institutional-quality apartment properties where we believe we can create long-term value for our stockholders utilizing the following investment strategies.

● | Value-Add. We invest in well-located institutional-quality apartment properties with strong and stable cash flows in demographically attractive knowledge economy growth markets where we believe there exists significant potential for medium-term capital appreciation through renovation or redevelopment, to reposition the asset and drive future rental growth. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | Opportunistic. We invest in properties available at opportunistic prices (i.e., at prices we believe are below those available in an otherwise efficient market) that exhibit some characteristics of distress, such as operational inefficiencies, significant deferred capital maintenance or broken capital structures providing an opportunity for a substantial portion of total return attributable to appreciation in value. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest-to-Own. We selectively invest in development of Class A properties in target markets where we believe we can capture significant development premiums upon completion. We generally use a mezzanine loan or convertible preferred equity structure which provides income during the development stage and/or the ability to capture development premiums at completion by exercising our conversion rights to take ownership. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Invest in Class A Apartment Properties.  We intend to continue to acquire primarily Class A apartment properties targeting the high disposable income renter by choice, where we believe we can create long-term value growth for our stockholders.
Focus on Growth Markets.  We intend to continue to focus on demographically attractive growth markets, which we define as markets with strong employment drivers in industries creating high disposable income jobs over the long term. Employment growth is highly correlated with apartment demand; therefore, we believe that selecting markets with job growth significantly above the national average will provide high potential for increased rental demand leading to revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Implement our Value Creation Strategies.  We intend to continue to focus on creating value at our properties utilizing our Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies in order to maximize our return on investment. We work with each member of our network to evaluate property needs along with value-creation opportunities and create an asset-specific business plan to best position or reposition each property to drive rental growth and asset values. We then provide an aggressive asset management presence to manage our network partner and ensure execution of the plan, with the goal of driving rental growth and values.
Implement our Live/Work/Play Initiatives.  We intend to continue to implement our amenities and attributes to transform the apartment community from a purely functional product (i.e., as solely a place to live), to a lifestyle product (i.e., as a place to live, interact, and socialize). Our Live/Work/Play initiatives are property specific, and generally consist of attributes that go beyond traditional features, including highly amenitized common areas, cosmetic and architectural improvements, technology, music and other community-oriented activities to appeal to our residents’ desire for a “sense of community” by creating places to gather, socialize and interact in an amenity-rich environment. We believe this creates an enhanced perception of value among residents, allowing for premium rental rates and improved resident retention.
Diversify Across Markets, Strategies and Investment Size.  We will seek to grow our high-quality portfolio of apartment properties diversified by geography and by investment strategy and by size (typically ranging from $50 to $100 million), in order to manage concentration risk, while driving both current income and capital appreciation throughout the portfolio. Our network enables us to diversify across multiple markets and multiple strategies efficiently, without the logistical burden and time delay of building operating infrastructure in multiple markets and across multiple investment strategies.
Selectively Harvest and Redeploy Capital.  On an opportunistic basis and subject to compliance with certain REIT restrictions, we intend to sell properties in cases where we have successfully executed our value creation plans and where we believe the investment has limited additional upside relative to other opportunities, in order to harvest profits and to reinvest proceeds to maximize stockholder value.

Distribution Policy
We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Code generally requires that a REIT annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain, and imposes tax on any taxable income retained by a REIT, including capital gains.
To satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT and generally not be subject to federal income and excise tax, we intend to continue to make regular distributions of all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to dividends paid, to our stockholders out of assets legally available for such purposes. All future distributions will be determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) on a quarterly basis, subject to operating restrictions in the Merger Agreement. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our Board will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations of future operating cash flows, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for acquisitions of new properties, development investments, general property capital improvements and debt repayments, (iv) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (v) the requirements of Maryland law, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay and (vii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our credit or other agreements.
Holders of shares of 8.250% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), were entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when authorized by our Board and declared by us from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were paid, payable quarterly in arrears on each January 5th, April 5th, July 5th and October 5th of each year, commencing on January 5, 2016, to holders of record on each December 25th, March 25th, June 25th and September 25th, respectively. From the date of original issue to, and including, February 26, 2021, we paid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 8.250% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $2.0625 per share). On February 26, 2021, the Company redeemed all remaining shares of its Series A Preferred Stock.
Holders of shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), are entitled to receive, when and as authorized by our Board and declared by us out of legally available funds, cumulative cash dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock at an annual rate of six percent (6%) of the initial stated value of $1,000 per share (the “Stated Value”). Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock will begin accruing on, and will be cumulative from, the date of issuance or the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid, payable monthly in arrears on the 5th day of each month to holders of record on the 25th day of the prior month; provided, however, that any such dividend may vary among holders of Series B Preferred Stock and may be prorated with respect to any shares of Series B Preferred Stock that were outstanding less than the total number of days in the dividend period immediately preceding the applicable dividend payment date, with the amount of any such prorated dividend being computed on the basis of the actual number of days in such dividend period during which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock were outstanding.

From the date of original issuance to, but not including, July 19, 2023, we will pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at the rate of 7.625% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.90625 per share). Commencing July 19, 2023, we will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock at an annual dividend rate of the initial rate increased by 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum, which will increase by an additional 2.0% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14.0%.

(i)Cumulative cash dividends on each share of Series T Preferred Stock at an annual rate of six and 15/100 percent (6.15%) of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.5375 per share).

(ii)Annual stock dividends on each share of Series T Preferred Stock, payable in shares of Series T Preferred Stock, each at an annual rate of 0.2% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share, for each of the first five (5) years from and including the later of (i) the year 2020 or (ii) the year of original issuance of each such share of Series T Preferred Stock, payable annually in arrears on the 29th day of December to eligible holders of record on the 24th day of December of each such year.

Holders of shares of Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), and Class C common stock $0.01 par value per share (the “Class C common stock”), will be entitled to receive cash dividends when, as and if authorized by our Board and declared by us. The common share dividend is paid on a quarterly basis, currently at an annual dividend rate of $0.65 per common share. The Board considered a number of factors in setting the current common stock dividend rate, including but not limited to achieving a sustainable dividend covered by core funds from operation (“CFFO”), multifamily and small cap peer dividend rates and payout ratios, providing financial flexibility for the Company, and achieving an appropriate balance between the retention of capital to invest and grow net asset value and the importance of current distributions.
We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows to make distributions to our stockholders, or that we will be able to sustain those distributions. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to allow us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, offering proceeds, borrow funds, sell assets, make a taxable distribution of our equity or debt securities, or reduce such distributions. Our distribution policy enables us to review the alternative funding sources available to us from time to time. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations, please see “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”

Industry Segments
Our current business consists of owning and operating residential investments that generate rental and other property-related income through the leasing of units to a diverse base of tenants. In prior years, we had on reportable segment as our investments were primarily in multifamily apartment communities. During 2021, we began increasing our investments in single-family residential homes, and as such, we have transitioned from a one-segment to a two-segment structure based on investment type. We evaluate operating performance on an individual property investment level and based on the investments’ similar economic characteristics. Our primary financial measure for operating performance is net operating income (“NOI”) as it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate-level expenses and those other items not related to property operating performance. We view our residential investments as two operating segments, and, accordingly, aggregate our properties into two reportable segments: multifamily apartment communities and single-family residential homes.
