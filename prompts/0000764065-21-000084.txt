Item 1. | Business

Introduction
Cliffs is the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America. Founded in 1847 as a mine operator, we are also the largest supplier of iron ore pellets in North America. In 2020, we acquired two major steelmakers, AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA, vertically integrating our legacy iron ore business with quality-focused steel production and emphasis on the automotive end market. Our fully integrated portfolio includes custom-made pellets and HBI; flat-rolled carbon steel, stainless, electrical, plate, tinplate and long steel products; as well as carbon and stainless steel tubing, hot and cold stamping and tooling. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, we employ approximately 25,000 people across our mining, steel and downstream manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada.
On March 13, 2020, we completed the acquisition of AK Steel, a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products. These operations consist primarily of seven steelmaking and finishing plants, two cokemaking operations, three tube manufacturing plants and ten tooling and stamping operations. The Tubular Components and Precision Partners businesses provide customer solutions with carbon and stainless steel tubing products, die design and tooling, and hot- and cold-stamped components.
On December 9, 2020, we completed the acquisition of ArcelorMittal USA. These operations include six steelmaking facilities, eight finishing facilities, two iron ore mining and pelletizing operations, one coal mining complex and three cokemaking operations. These assets build upon our existing high-end steelmaking and raw material capabilities, and also open up new markets to us. The combination provides us additional scale and technical capabilities necessary in a competitive and increasingly quality-focused marketplace.
Competitive Strengths
As the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America, we benefit from having the size and scale necessary in a competitive, capital intensive business. Our sizeable operating footprint provides us with the operational leverage, flexibility and cost performance to achieve competitive margins throughout the business cycle. We also have a unique vertically integrated profile, which begins at the mining stage and goes all the way through the manufacturing of steel products, including stamping, tooling and tubing. This positioning gives us both lower and more predictable costs throughout the supply chain and more control over both our manufacturing inputs and our end product destination.
Our legacy business of producing iron ore pellets, our primary steelmaking raw material input, is another competitive advantage. Mini-mills (producers using EAFs) comprise about 70% of steel production in the U.S. Their primary iron input is scrap metal, which has unpredictable and often volatile pricing. By controlling our iron ore pellet supply, our primary steelmaking raw material feedstock can be secured at a stable and predictable cost, and not subject to factors outside of our control.
We are also the largest supplier of automotive-grade steel in the U.S. Compared to other steel end markets, automotive steel is generally higher quality and more operationally and technologically intensive to produce. As such, it often generates higher through-the-cycle margins, making it a desirable end market for the steel industry. With our continued technological innovation, as well as leading delivery performance, we expect to remain the leader in supplying this industry.
We offer the most comprehensive flat-rolled steel product selection in the industry, along with several complementary products and services. A sampling of this offering includes AHSS, hot-dipped galvanized, aluminized, galvalume, electrogalvanized, galvanneal, HRC, cold-rolled coil, plate, tinplate, GOES, NOES, stainless steels, tool & die, stamped components, rail and slabs. Across the quality spectrum and the supply chain, our customers can frequently find the solutions they need from our product selection.
We are the first and the only supplier of HBI in the Great Lakes region. Construction of our Toledo, Ohio, direct reduction plant was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. From this modern plant, we offer a high-quality scrap and pig iron alternative to the several EAFs in the region. Previously, ore-based metallics that compete with our HBI had to be imported from locations like Russia, Ukraine and Brazil. With growing EAF capacity in the U.S. and 
increasing tightness in the scrap market, we expect our Toledo direct reduction plant to generate healthy margins for us going forward.
Strategy
Optimizing Our Fully-Integrated Steelmaking Footprint 
We have transformed into a fully-integrated steel enterprise with the size and scale to achieve improved through-the-cycle margins and are the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America. 
Now that the AM USA Transaction is completed, our focus is on the integration of these facilities within our footprint. These assets build upon our existing high-end steelmaking and raw material capabilities, and also open up new markets to us. The combination provides us the additional scale and technical capabilities necessary in a competitive and increasingly quality-focused marketplace. We have ample opportunities to implement improvements in logistics, procurement, utilization and quality.
We expect the AM USA Transaction to improve our production capabilities, flexibility, and cost performance. We have identified approximately $150 million of potential cost synergies through asset optimization, economies of scale, and duplicative overhead savings. The AM USA Transaction also enhances optionality for future production of merchant pig iron to complement our HBI offering in the metallics space.
Maximizing Our Commercial Strengths
With the Acquisitions completed, we now have enhanced our offering to a full suite of flat steel products encompassing all steps of the steel manufacturing process. We have increased our industry-leading market share in the automotive sector, where our portfolio of high-end products will deliver a broad range of differentiated solutions for this highly sought after customer base.
We believe we have the broadest flat steel product offering in North America, and can meet customer needs from a variety of end markets and quality specifications. We have several finishing and downstream facilities with advanced technological capabilities. We also pride ourselves on our excellent delivery performance, which provides us opportunities to augment our relationships with current customers given our reputation as a reliable supplier.
We are also proponents of the “value over volume” approach in terms of steel supply. We take our leadership role in the industry very seriously and intend to manage our steel output in a responsible manner.
Expanding to New Markets
Our Toledo direct reduction plant allows us to offer another unique, high-quality product to discerning raw material buyers. EAF steelmakers primarily use scrap for their iron feedstock, and our HBI offers a sophisticated alternative with less impurities, allowing other steelmakers to increase the quality of their respective end-steel products and reduce reliance on imported metallics.
The completed Acquisitions provide other potential outlets for HBI, as it can also be used in our integrated steel operations to increase productivity and help to reduce carbon footprint, allowing for more cost efficient and environmentally friendly steelmaking.
We are also seeking to expand our customer base with the rapidly growing and desirable electric vehicle market. At this time, we believe the North American automotive industry is approaching a monumental inflection point, with the adoption of electrical motors in passenger vehicles. As this market grows, it will require more advanced steel applications to meet the needs of electric vehicle producers and consumers. With our unique technical capabilities, we believe we are positioned better than any other North American steelmaker to supply the steel and parts necessary to fill these needs.
Improving Financial Flexibility
Given the cyclicality of our business, it is important to us to be in the financial position to easily withstand any negative demand or pricing pressure we may encounter. As such, our top priority for the allocation of our free cash flow is to improve our balance sheet via the reduction of long-term debt. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to issue secured debt to provide insurance capital through the uncertain industry conditions that the pandemic caused. Now that business conditions have improved and we expect to generate healthy free cash flow during 2021, we have the ability to lower our long-term debt balance. 
Our stated initial target will be to reduce total debt to less than three times our annual Adjusted EBITDA. We will continue to review the composition of our debt, as we are interested in both extending our maturity profile and increasing our ratio of unsecured debt to secured debt, which we demonstrated by executing a series of favorable debt and equity capital markets transactions during February 2021, as described under Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These actions will better prepare us to navigate more easily through potentially volatile industry conditions in the future.
Enhance our Environmental Sustainability
As the Company transforms, our commitment to operating our business in a more environmentally responsible manner remains constant. One of the most important issues impacting our industry, our stakeholders and our planet is climate change. As a result, we are continuing Cliffs’ proactive approach by announcing our plan to reduce GHG emissions 25% from 2017 levels by 2030. This goal represents combined Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emission reductions across all of our operations.
Prior to setting this goal with our newly acquired steel assets, we exceeded our previous 26% GHG reduction target at our legacy facilities six years ahead of our 2025 goal. In 2019, we reduced our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 42% on a mass basis from 2005 baseline levels. Our goal is to further reduce those emissions in coming years. 
Additionally, many of our steel assets have improved plant and energy efficiency through participation in programs like the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Plants program and the EPA’s Energy Star program. With our longstanding focus on plant and energy efficiency, we aim to build on our previous successes across our newly integrated enterprise.
Our GHG reduction commitment is based on executing the following five strategic priorities:
•Developing domestically sourced, high quality iron ore feedstock and utilizing natural gas in the production of HBI;
•Implementing energy efficiency and clean energy projects;
•Investing in the development of carbon capture technology; 
•Enhancing our GHG emissions transparency and sustainability focus; and
•Supporting public policies that facilitate GHG reduction in the domestic steel industry.
Business Operations
We are vertically integrated from the mining of iron ore and coal; to production of metallics and coke; through iron making, steelmaking, rolling and finishing; and to downstream tubular components, stamping and tooling. We have the unique advantage as a steel producer of being fully or partially self-sufficient with our production of raw materials for steel manufacturing, which includes iron ore pellets, HBI and coking coal. As we expand our presence, we believe such vertical integration represents a sustainable business model that is in the best interest of all stakeholders and the surest way to secure a long-term competitive advantage. 
We strive to operate responsibly and produce more environmentally friendly iron ore pellets that enable production of clean steel, which is also the most recycled material on the planet. Additionally, our investment in the direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio, also helps to support environmental stewardship, as the production of HBI is more environmentally friendly than its substitute, foreign pig iron. From a focus on key environmental processes, such as steel recycling and water reuse, to corporate and social responsibility, sustainability is central to our values and operations.
We have updated our segment structure to coincide with our new business model and are organized into four operating segments based on differentiated products, Steelmaking, Tubular, Tooling and Stamping, and European Operations. Through the third quarter ended September 30, 2020, we had operated through two reportable segments – the Steel and Manufacturing segment and the Mining and Pelletizing segment. However, given the recent transformation of the business, beginning with our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, we primarily operate through one reportable segment – the Steelmaking segment.

Customers and Markets
We primarily sell our products to customers in four broad market categories: automotive; infrastructure and manufacturing, which includes electrical power; distributors and converters; and steel producers, which consume iron ore and metallics. The following table presents the percentage of our net sales to each of these markets during the year:

Market | 2020
Automotive | 45 | %
Infrastructure and manufacturing | 15 | %
Distributors and converters | 13 | %
Steel producers | 27 | %

Certain of our flat-rolled steel shipments are sold under fixed base price contracts. These contracts are typically one year in duration and expire at various times throughout the year. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes through certain changes in input costs. A certain portion of our flat-rolled steel shipments are sold based on the spot market at prevailing market prices or under contracts that involve variable pricing that is tied to an independently published steel index. 
We sell our steel products principally to customers in North America. For the vast majority of international sales, we are not the importer of record and do not bear the responsibility for paying any applicable tariffs.
Automotive Market
The automotive industry is our largest market, and we aim to address the principal needs of major automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. We specialize in manufacturing difficult-to-produce, high-quality steel products, combined with demanding delivery performance, customer technical support and collaborative relationships, to develop breakthrough steel solutions that help our customers meet their product requirements. In addition, many of our competitors do not have the capability to supply the full portfolio of products that we make for our automotive customers, such as steel for exposed automotive applications, the most sophisticated grades of AHSS and value-added stainless steel products. The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally allows for higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets. 
In light of the automotive market’s importance to us, North American light vehicle production has a significant impact on our total sales and shipments. North American light vehicle production for 2020 declined 20% to approximately 13 million units from the prior year due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced businesses to begin to shut down at the end of March 2020 until they slowly re-started near the end of the second quarter. During the third quarter of 2020, auto makers saw the pent-up demand bring sales back to more normal levels as buyers and dealers adapted to new procedures and virtual shopping. Fourth quarter 2020 sales were more in line with expected sales for the time of year, but did not quite return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Currently, we are expecting North American light vehicle production in 2021 to significantly increase and return to near 2019 levels, which to an extent depends on continued demand, the level of fiscal stimulus provided under the new Biden Administration, timing of COVID-19 vaccination distribution and how quickly the economy recovers.
Furthermore, during 2020, consumer demand for sport utility vehicles, trucks, crossovers and larger vehicles continued to increase while demand for smaller sedans and compact cars declined. We benefit from intentionally targeting larger vehicle platforms to take advantage of consumer preferences, and we have focused on and have been successful in getting sourced on numerous sport utility vehicles, truck, crossover and larger vehicle platforms. As a result, a significant portion of the carbon automotive steel that we sell is used to produce these popular larger vehicles. In addition to benefiting from our exposure to consumers’ strong demand for larger vehicles, these vehicles also typically contain a higher volume of steel than smaller sedans and compact cars, providing us the opportunity to sell a greater proportion of our steel products to our automotive customers.
Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve heightened federally mandated fuel economy standards (the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE,” standards). The CAFE standards generally require automobile manufacturers to meet an average fuel economy goal across the fleet of vehicles they produce with certain milestone dates. As a result, our automotive customers continue to explore various avenues for achieving the standards, including light weighting components and developing more fuel-efficient engines. Light weighting efforts include the use of alternatives to traditional carbon steels, such as AHSS and other materials. While this could reduce the aggregate volume of steel consumed by the automotive industry, we expect that demand will increase for current 
and next-generation AHSS and that our AHSS and other innovative steels will command higher margins. We are collaborating with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop innovative solutions using our developments in light weighting, efficiency, and material strength and formability across our extensive product portfolio, in combination with our automotive stamping and tube-making capabilities. We are also working with our customers to develop steels with greater heat resistance for exhaust systems that support new, fuel-efficient engines that run at higher temperatures. 
Automotive manufacturers have also been increasing their development of H/EVs and battery electric vehicles in order to meet the CAFE standards and growing customer adoption of H/EVs. Many motors used in H/EVs being sold in the U.S. today are imported from foreign suppliers, but more local sourcing and manufacturing of motors is expected to occur in the future. As the only North American producer of high-efficiency NOES, which is a critical component of H/EV motors, we are positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of H/EVs going forward. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and long-standing relationships with automotive manufacturers and their suppliers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it continues to grow and mature. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of H/EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging, which our GOES could support.
Infrastructure and Manufacturing Market
We sell a variety of our steel products, including plate, carbon, stainless, electrical, tinplate and rail, to the infrastructure and manufacturing market. This market includes sales to manufacturers of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, appliances, power transmission and distribution transformers, storage tanks, ships and railcars, wind towers, machinery parts, heavy equipment, military armor, food preservation, and railway lines. Domestic construction activity and the replacement of aging infrastructure directly affects sales of steel to this market. During 2020, there were nearly 1.4 million new housing starts in the U.S., an increase of approximately 6% from 2019, and home sales reached nearly 6 million, the highest annual mark since 2006, with the supply of existing homes having reached all-time lows. The recent strength in home sales has been due to lower mortgage rates and remote work flexibility and is expected to continue through 2021.
Distributors and Converters Market 
Virtually all of the grades of steel we produce are sold to the steel distributors and converters market. This market generally represents downstream steel service centers, who source various types of steel from us and fabricate it according to their customers' needs. Our steel is typically sold to this market on a spot basis or under short-term contracts linked to steel pricing indices. Demand and pricing for this market can be highly dependent on a variety of factors outside our control, including global and domestic commodity steel production capacity, the relative health of countries’ economies and whether they are consuming or exporting excess steel capacity, the provisions of international trade agreements and fluctuations in international currencies and, therefore, are subject to market changes in steel prices.
The price for domestic HRC, which is an important attribute in the profitability of this end market, averaged $588 per net ton for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2% lower than the prior year. The price of HRC was negatively impacted by lower demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and hit a low point of $438 per net ton on April 30, 2020. However, as the industry recovered and supply-demand dynamics improved, the price rebounded dramatically, rising to a peak of $1,030 per net ton by December 31, 2020 and reaching all time-highs early in 2021. The improved pricing environment should bolster profitability for this end market during 2021.
Steel Producers Market
The steel producers market represents third-party sales to other steel producers, including those who operate blast furnaces and EAFs. It includes sales of raw materials and semi-finished and finished goods, including iron ore pellets, coal, coke, HBI and steel products. 
The merchant portion of our iron ore pellet production is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements and through spot contracts. Certain of our supply agreements contain a base price that is adjusted periodically as specified by the contracts, using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that could result in price adjustments under our contracts include changes in the Platts 62% price, published Platts international indexed freight rates and changes in specified PPI, including those for industrial commodities, fuel and steel. 
As a result of the Acquisitions, production from our iron ore mines is now predominantly consumed by our newly acquired steelmaking operations. On a full-year basis, we would expect between 22 million and 24 million long tons of our iron ore pellets to be consumed by our steelmaking operations. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold 12 
million, 19 million and 21 million long tons of iron ore product, respectively, to third parties from our share of production from our iron ore mines.
We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard, fluxed and DR-grade, for use as part of the steelmaking process. The variation in grade of iron ore pellets results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine, the requirements of end users' steelmaking processes and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. Although the grade or grades of pellets currently delivered to each customer are based on that customer’s preferences, which depend in part on the characteristics of the customer’s steelmaking operation, in certain cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably. Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace. DR-grade pellets require additional processing to make a pellet that contains higher iron and lower silica content than a standard pellet. Unlike standard or fluxed pellets, DR-grade pellets are produced to be fed into a direct reduction facility.
Beginning in 2021, we expect to also sell HBI to third-party customers, primarily EAFs with operations in the Great Lakes region. We expect our Toledo direct reduction plant to begin shipping saleable product to third-party customers during the first quarter of 2021. The Toledo direct reduction plant has a nameplate production capacity of 1.9 million metric tons, and we expect to reach its productive capacity by the second quarter of 2021.
Applied Technology, Research and Development
We have an extensive history of being an innovator dating back more than a century. From upstream research and development, to downstream applications, we have dedicated technical and engineering resources that begin with improving customers' production and manufacturing performance to applications for their end product use. 
We have been a leader in iron ore mining and processing technology through the application of new technology to the centuries-old business of mineral extraction. We have also been a pioneer in iron ore pelletizing with over 60 years of experience. We are able to produce customized, environmentally friendly pellets to meet blast furnace specifications and produce standard, fluxed and DR-grade pellets. 
We now have a world-class research and development team expanding our capabilities to bring new steel products to the marketplace. Rapidly evolving and highly competitive markets for our steel products require our customers to seek new, comprehensive steel solutions, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver the most robust solutions through our broad portfolio of offerings. Collaboration across our research groups and operations generates innovative and comprehensive solutions for our customers, which we believe enhances our competitive advantage.
Creating innovative products and breakthrough solutions is a strategic priority, as we believe differentiation through producing higher value steels to meet challenging requirements enables us to maintain and enhance our margins. We conduct a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and processes and developing new ones. Our innovation of steel has produced a highly diversified steel product portfolio. As part of our underlying strategy to focus on higher-value materials and minimize exposure to commodity products, we have invested in research and innovation totaling $15 million in 2020. Our ongoing efforts at our state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio, to enhance technical collaboration have increased the introduction of new steel solutions to the marketplace.
HBI
We are a pioneer in the development of emerging reduction technologies, a leader in the extraction of value from challenging resources and a front-runner in the implementation of safe and sustainable technology. We are also devoted to promoting environmental sustainability, evidenced with the development of our direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. We expect our introduction of HBI to the Great Lakes EAF market will be notable in the evolution of the steel industry. 
We completed construction of our Toledo direct reduction plant and began production in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our Toledo direct reduction plant is expected to produce 1.9 million metric tons of HBI per year, replacing a portion of the over 3 million metric tons of ore-based metallics that are imported into the Great Lakes region every year from Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and Venezuela, as well as approximately 20 million metric tons of scrap used in the Great Lakes area every year.
Carbon Steel
We focus much of our research and innovation efforts on carbon steel applications for automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. We are particularly focused on AHSS for the automotive market, and we produce virtually every AHSS grade currently used by our customers. Our AHSS grades, such as Dual Phase 590, 780, 980 and 1180, have been adopted by our customers for both stamped and roll-formed parts, and our NEXMET® 1000 and 1200 products have demonstrated enhanced strength, formability and opportunities for automotive light weighting in cold-stamped applications. We are also pursuing application of NEXMET 440EX and NEXMET 490EX in surface-critical, exposed auto body panels as an alternative to aluminum.
Third Generation Advanced High-Strength Steel
Our third generation NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS products enable our customers to achieve significant light weighting in the unexposed structural components of their vehicles. NEXMET 1200, for example, offers superior formability similar to conventional Dual Phase 600 steel, but at twice the strength level. We have expanded the application of the NEXMET technology to our tubular products and stamped components businesses. These AHSS products allow automotive engineers to design lightweight parts that meet rigorous service and safety requirements. The NEXMET family of steels helps our customers achieve vehicle weight savings for ambitious fuel efficiency standards while avoiding significant capital costs required to re-design production facilities to use alternative materials.
Both galvanized and cold-rolled NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS are progressing through product qualification with several original equipment manufacturer customers. A number of stamping and component assembly trials have been completed successfully, with more planned and underway. Because the timing of automotive design and production cycles spans several years, widespread automotive customer adoption of revolutionary new material such as NEXMET AHSS may also extend over several years. We expect that other automotive vehicle platforms will incorporate NEXMET AHSS in their designs and that NEXMET AHSS will become a strong differentiator for us going forward. 
Downstream Steel Applications
Our portfolio of steel solutions includes the operations of Precision Partners, which provides advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot and cold-stamped components and complex assemblies for the automotive market. In addition to Precision Partners, our downstream operations include Tubular Components, which manufactures advanced tubular products for automotive and other applications using carbon and stainless steels. We believe that collaboration among our steelmaking operations and our downstream businesses can accelerate the adoption of our innovative steel products by automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers.
Our research and technical experts have undertaken numerous collaborative projects that are generating robust solutions for our customers. Precision Partners’ expertise in tool design and stamping capabilities has allowed us to create prototype components using AK Steel’s innovative new materials and present customers with new potential steel solutions. This approach has and, we expect, will continue to demonstrate to customers that they can significantly lightweight automotive parts on an accelerated timeline and in a cost-effective manner by using our highly formable grades of AHSS in place of traditional material types. 
In addition, our collaborative projects are enhancing our collective knowledge and experience in the stamping of new, advanced grades of steel, advanced engineered solutions, and tool design and build. For example, Precision Partners specializes in hot-stamping PHS for automotive applications. AK Steel’s experience as a leader in PHS and Precision Partners’ expertise in hot-stamping has enabled these teams to have greater insight into these high-growth areas and has accelerated product development and customer adoption of these automotive light weighting solutions. Likewise, collaboration with Tubular Components strategically advances our mission to innovate in AHSS for the automotive industry, as Tubular Components has been at the forefront of producing tubular products from third-generation AHSS. We believe the combination of Precision Partners’ stamping and advanced die-making capabilities, Tubular Component’s leading tube making capabilities and our breakthrough material introductions will enhance our ability to deliver innovative, steel solutions to our customers.
Precision Partners has recently been awarded contracts with several customers to supply complex assemblies and stamped automotive parts. In winning these contracts, Precision Partners has been able to leverage our hot-stamping tooling leadership, in addition to our innovative hot-stamping process, to capture new strategic opportunities and demonstrate that Precision Partners is one of the few businesses in North America that has the technical capabilities to produce a major complex assembly and stamping work of this nature.
Competition
We principally compete with domestic and foreign producers of flat-rolled carbon, plate, stainless, rail and electrical steel, carbon and stainless tubular products, aluminum, carbon fiber, concrete and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. Precision Partners and Tubular Components both compete against other niche companies in highly fragmented markets.
Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements. Steel producers that sell to the automotive market face competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that will enable them to satisfy more stringent, government-imposed fuel efficiency standards. To address automotive manufacturers’ light weighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we and others in the steel industry are developing AHSS grades that we believe provide weight savings similar to aluminum, while being stronger, less costly, more sustainable, easier to repair and more environmentally friendly. Aluminum penetration has been primarily limited to specific automotive applications, such as outer panels and closures, rather than entire body designs. In addition, our automotive customers who continue to use steel, as opposed to aluminum and other alternative materials, are able to avoid the significant capital expenditures required to re-tool their manufacturing processes to accommodate the use of non-steel materials.
Mini-mills (producers using EAFs) comprise about 70% of steel production in the U.S. Their primary raw material is scrap metal, which has unpredictable and often volatile pricing. Due to the announced mini-mill capacity additions in the U.S. and increasing demand for scrap from China, we expect the price of scrap to remain elevated over historical averages, providing our integrated footprint a competitive advantage. Mini-mills also generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills, but the increasing use of pig iron and direct reduced iron have enabled them to modestly expand their product capabilities in recent years. However, we believe mini-mills often do not have the equipment capabilities to produce the product range that integrated facilities offer, nor do we believe they possess our depth of customer service, technical support, and research and innovation.
Domestic steel producers, including us, face significant competition from foreign producers. For many reasons, these foreign producers often are able to sell products in the U.S. at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of origin, these reasons may include government subsidies; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. Since late 2017, import levels of flat-rolled products into the United States have shown a gradual and steady decline and have recently been more reflective of historical levels before the unprecedented surge that began in 2014. We believe the decline is at least partially attributable to the implementation of certain trade restrictions on imported steel over the past five years, including both targeted trade cases and the more broad Section 232 tariffs. Modifications to these trade restrictions by government officials could directly or indirectly impact import levels in the future. Import levels are also affected to varying degrees by the relative level of steel production in China and other countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the U.S. and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies. Imports of finished steel into the U.S. accounted for approximately 18% of domestic steel market consumption in 2020. 
We continue to provide significant pension and healthcare benefits to a great number of our retirees compared to certain other domestic and foreign steel producers that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees, which increases our overall cost of production relative to certain other steelmakers. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including negotiating progressive labor agreements that have significantly reduced total employment costs at all of our union-represented facilities, transferring all responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to VEBAs, offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants, lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees, and transferring pension obligations to highly rated insurance companies. These actions have not only reduced some of the risks associated with our pension fund obligations, but more importantly have reduced our risk exposure to performance of the financial markets, which are a principal driver of pension funding requirements. We continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs.
Environment 
Our mining, steel and downstream manufacturing operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We monitor these laws and regulations, which change over time, to assess whether the changes affect our operations. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment. 
Environmental matters and their management continued to be an important focus at each of our operations throughout 2020, including operations at AK Steel (acquired in March 2020) and ArcelorMittal USA (acquired in December 2020). In the construction and operation of our facilities, substantial costs have been and will continue to be incurred to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid undue effect on the environment. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled approximately $34 million, $9 million, and $10 million, respectively. Our current estimate for capital expenditures for environmental improvements in 2021 is approximately $51 million for various water treatment, air quality, dust control, tailings management and other miscellaneous environmental projects. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures for environmental improvements for each of 2022 and 2023 to be generally in line with 2021's estimated spending. 
Regulatory Developments
Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect us, our customers, and our suppliers in many areas, including waste discharge and disposal, the classification of materials and products, air and water discharges and other environmental, health, and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws, regulations or permits would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective potential adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations. Moreover, because all domestic steel and mining producers operate under the same federal environmental regulations, we do not believe that we are more disadvantaged than our domestic competitors by our need to comply with these regulations. Some foreign competitors may benefit from less stringent environmental requirements in the countries where they produce, resulting in lower compliance costs for them and providing those foreign competitors with a cost advantage on their products.
Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: Minnesota's potential revisions to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard; evolving water quality standards for selenium and conductivity; scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of “Waters of the United States”; Minnesota's Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; Climate Change and GHG Regulation; the Regional Haze FIP Rule; and the regulation of discharges to groundwater. 
Minnesota’s Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard
The Minnesota Governor established a Wild Rice Task Force by Executive Order in May 2018 that provided recommendations to the Governor’s Office on wild rice restoration and regulation. The existing water quality standard for wild rice has not been applied to any of our discharge permits or enforced in decades, and it may be unenforceable because of legislation and because the water bodies to which the existing standard applies have never been identified specifically in rule, nor are there criteria for identifying them. The MPCA is complying with the legislation that prohibits enforcement of the water quality standard until the obsolete standard is updated based on modern science. For these reasons, the impact of the proposed wild rice water quality standard to our Minnesota iron ore mining and pelletizing operations is not estimable at this time, but it could have an adverse material impact if we are required to significantly reduce sulfate in our discharges.
Selenium Discharge Regulation
In Michigan, the Empire and Tilden mines have implemented compliance plans to manage selenium according to the permit conditions. The remaining infrastructure needed for management of selenium in stormwater will likely be completed in 2021. A water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated sometime before 2028. As of December 31, 2020, included within our Empire asset retirement obligation is a discounted liability of approximately $100 million, which includes the estimated costs associated with the construction of Empire's portion of the required infrastructure and expected future operating costs of the treatment facilities. Additionally, included within our Tilden future capital plan is approximately $20 million for the construction of Tilden's portion of the required infrastructure. We are continuing to assess and develop cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies.
In July 2016, the EPA published new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria, which may someday increase the cost for treatment should EGLE adopt these new standards in lieu of the existing limits required by the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or long-term impact of the water quality criteria to our business.
Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy
In September 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rules mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reductions from certain sources, including taconite facilities. The rule is applicable to all of our Minnesota iron mining and pelletizing operations and required submittal of a Mercury Reduction Plan to the MPCA by the end of 2018 with plan implementation requirements becoming effective on January 1, 2025. In the Mercury Reduction Plan, facilities evaluated if available control technologies can technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate. If available control technologies cannot technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate, the facilities must propose alternative mercury reduction measures. One of the main tenets agreed upon for evaluating potential mercury reduction technologies during TMDL implementation and 2014 rule development proceedings was that the selected technology must meet the following “Adaptive Management Criteria”: the technology must be technically feasible; must be economically feasible; must not impact pellet quality; and must not cause excessive corrosion in the indurating furnaces or air pollution control equipment.
The Mercury Reduction Plans for our Minnesota facilities were submitted to the MPCA in December 2018. In 2020, the MPCA provided comments on the plans and we responded in a timely manner.  There is currently no proven technology to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to achieve the targeted 72% reduction rate, while satisfying all four Adaptive Management Criteria. The Mercury Reduction Plans that were submitted to the MPCA include documentation that describes the results of detailed engineering analysis and research testing on potential technologies to support this determination. The results of this analysis will continue to guide dialogue with the MPCA. Potential impacts to us are not estimable at this time because the revised Mercury Reduction Plans and additional technical information are currently being reviewed by the MPCA.
Climate Change and GHG Regulation
With the complexities and uncertainties associated with the U.S. and global navigation of the climate change issue as a whole, one of our potentially significant risks for the future is mandatory carbon pricing obligations. Policymakers are in the design process of carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. The current regulatory patchwork of carbon compliance schemes presents a challenge for multi-facility entities to identify their near-term risks. Amplifying the uncertainty, the dynamic forward outlook for carbon pricing obligations presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change adaptation. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change. As an energy-intensive business, our GHG emissions inventory includes a broad range of emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, diesel mining equipment, and integrated steelmaking facilities, among others. As such, our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts), and (2) indirect costs passed through to us from electrical and fuel suppliers (indirect impacts).
Internationally, mechanisms to reduce emissions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. The Paris Agreement to reduce global GHG emissions and limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius became effective in November 2016 with 196 signatory countries. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order triggering the 30-day process of rejoining the Paris Agreement, beginning the process of a pledge to reduce U.S. GHG emissions. During the Obama Administration, the U.S. became a signatory to the Paris Agreement with a pledge to reduce its GHG emissions by 26-28% from 2005 levels by 2025. Continued attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation may have a material impact on our customer base, operations and financial results in the future.
In the U.S., future federal and/or state carbon regulation potentially presents a significantly greater impact to our operations. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to GHG control and potential carbon pricing impacts. We intend to remain active in the discussions related to legislative and regulatory changes at the federal and state levels.
Due to the potential patchwork of federal, state or regional carbon restriction schemes, our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on GHG emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced substantially by numerous factors, including currently contemplated regulatory flexibility mechanisms, such as allowance allocations, fixed process emissions exemptions, offsets and international provisions; emissions reduction opportunities, including energy efficiency, biofuels and fuel flexibility; and business opportunities associated with pursuing combined heat and power partnerships and new products, including DR-grade pellets, HBI, fluxed pellets and other efficiency-improving technologies.
Regional Haze FIP Rule
In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to its regional haze rules that require states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all Class I national parks and wilderness areas to natural background levels by 2064. Among the states with Class I areas are Michigan and Minnesota, in which we currently own mining operations, and Indiana, in which we own steelmaking operations. The first phase of the regional haze rule required analysis and installation of BART on eligible emission sources and incorporation of BART and associated emission limits into SIPs.
EPA disapproved Minnesota's and Michigan's BART SIPs for taconite furnaces and instead promulgated a Taconite Regional Haze FIP in February 2013. We petitioned the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the FIP and filed a joint motion for stay of the 2013 FIP, which was granted in June 2013. We reached a settlement agreement with EPA, which was subsequently published in the Federal Register to implement components of the settlement agreement in April 2016, with an effective date of May 12, 2016. We believe the 2016 Regional Haze FIP reflects progress toward a more technically and economically feasible regional haze implementation plan. In November 2016, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals terminated the June 2013 stay and extended the deadlines in the original 2013 FIP. Cost estimates associated with implementation of the 2013 and 2016 FIPs are reflected in our five-year capital plan.
Due to inconsistencies in language describing the procedures for calculating NOx emission limits between the settlement agreement and the 2016 FIP final rule, we jointly filed a Petition for Reconsideration and Petition for Judicial Review in June 2016. We have been working toward a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve the outstanding issue with the emission limit calculation method and anticipate resolution of the issue in 2021. The outcome of this proceeding is not expected to have a material adverse impact on us.
In 2020, the states began a second decadal review, which examined if additional technological controls are warranted for certain sources. The states are required to submit their updated Regional Haze SIPs by July 2021. At this time, we do not expect any state will require additional emission control requirements on our operations. We will review and comment on SIPs as necessary in the states in which we operate.
Conductivity
Conductivity, the measurement of water’s ability to conduct electricity, is a surrogate parameter that generally increases as the amount of dissolved minerals in water increases. In December 2016, EPA issued a notice soliciting public comments on its draft guidance, Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity. In April 2017, comments were submitted by our trade associations providing objective evidence indicating the draft methodology was scientifically flawed and unfit for promulgation. EPA confirmed in October 2019 that the 2016 draft guidance was rescinded in accordance with an August 2019 EPA memorandum regarding draft guidance documents and further expressed that EPA must update the science and subject future recommended methods or criteria for conductivity to peer review and public comment. Although the adoption of the previously proposed methodology is unlikely in the states, the Fond du Lac Band in Minnesota adopted certain conductivity criteria in 2020. We are assessing the impact of those criteria on our Minnesota iron ore mining and pelletizing operations and evaluating methods to challenge the criteria as a whole or on a site-by-site basis.
Definition of “Waters of the United States” Under the Clean Water Act
The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule in October 2019 repealing the 2015 rule that was to become effective on December 23, 2019. On April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Department of the Army published the Navigable Waters Protection Rule in the Federal Register to finalize a revised definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. For the first time, the agencies have streamlined the definition so that it includes four simple categories of jurisdictional waters, provides clear exclusions for many water features that traditionally have not been regulated, and defines terms in the regulatory text that have never been defined before. The rule is on 
appeal in various jurisdictions. The rule is not expected to have a material adverse effect on us, but we will continue to assess the potential impacts to our operations.
Regulation of Discharges to Groundwater
In general, states traditionally have regulated discharges of pollutants to groundwater through various programs such as wellhead protection programs and regulations related to remediation. In April 2020, the United States Supreme Court held in County of Maui v. Hawaiʻi Wildlife Fund that EPA (and delegated states) have jurisdiction under the NPDES program if the discharge to groundwater is the “functional equivalent” of a discharge to waters of the United States. Until now, the NPDES program has only regulated direct discharges to waters of the United States from point sources. EPA subsequently issued a guidance document on what the term “functional equivalent” means. Although we do not anticipate that broadening EPA jurisdiction over groundwater discharges will materially adversely affect our operations, the impact to our operations is not reasonably estimable at this time.
Raw Materials and Energy
Our steelmaking operations require iron ore, coke, coal, ferrous and carbon and stainless scrap, chrome, nickel and zinc as primary raw materials. We also consume natural gas, electricity, industrial gases and diesel fuel at our steelmaking and mining operations. As a vertically integrated steel company, we are able to internally supply a majority of our raw materials needed for our steelmaking operations. We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace for those raw materials that we cannot supply internally, we may use these contracts to secure sufficient supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we purchase the remainder of our raw materials needs under annual contracts or conduct spot purchases. We also regularly evaluate alternative sources and substitute materials. Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility and risk. We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply to fulfill our raw materials and energy requirements for 2021.
The raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel production equipment. For example, generally, in our integrated steelmaking facilities, we consume approximately 1.4 net tons of coal to produce one net ton of coke. The process to produce one ton of raw steel generally requires approximately 1.4 net tons of iron ore pellets, 0.4 net tons of coke and 0.3 net tons of steel scrap. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 MMBtu’s of natural gas per net ton produced. Additionally, on average, our EAF's require 1.1 net tons of ferrous or stainless scrap to produce one net ton of high quality steel. We consume approximately 420 kilowatt-hours of electricity per net ton of steel produced. While these estimated consumption amounts are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption used in our steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Our investment into HBI production provides us access, when needed, to clean iron units in order to make advanced steel and stainless products. This access to our own production provides us flexibility and allows us to avoid the risks and carbon footprints of imported iron substitutes. Iron substitutes imported into the U.S. are traditionally sourced from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil and have lower pollution standards than the U.S. Our investment demonstrates our raw material and company strategy in responsibly managing the risks of pricing, availability and overall carbon footprint of our critical inputs. 
We typically purchase ferrous and stainless steel scrap, natural gas, a substantial portion of our electricity and most other raw materials at prevailing market prices, which may fluctuate with market supply and demand. 
Iron Ore
We own or co-own five active iron ore mines in Minnesota and Michigan. Based on our ownership in these mines, our share of annual rated iron ore production capacity is approximately 28.0 million long tons, which supplies all of the iron ore needed for our steelmaking operations. Refer to Part I - Item 2. Properties for additional information.
Coke and Coal
We own five cokemaking facilities, including two coke batteries located within our steelmaking facilities. These facilities currently provide over half of the coke requirements for our steelmaking operations and have an annual rated capacity of approximately 3.9 million tons. Additionally, we have coke supply agreements with suppliers that provide our remaining requirements. Our purchases of coke are made under annual or multi-year agreements 
with periodic price adjustments. We typically purchase most of our metallurgical coal under annual fixed-price agreements. We have annual rated metallurgical coal production capacity of 2.3 million net tons from our Princeton mine, which supplies a portion of our metallurgical coal needs. We believe there are adequate external supplies of coke and coal available at competitive market prices to meet our needs. Refer to Part I - Item 2. Properties for additional information.
Steel Scrap and Other Materials
Generally, approximately 43% of our steel scrap requirements are generated internally through normal operations. We believe that supplies of steel scrap, chrome, nickel and zinc adequate to meet the needs of our steelmaking operations are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Energy
We consume a large amount of natural gas, electricity, industrial gases and diesel fuel, which are significant costs to our operations. The majority of our energy requirements are purchased from outside sources. Access to long-term, low cost sources of energy in various forms is critically important to our operations.
Natural gas is procured for our operations utilizing a combination of long-term, annual, quarterly, monthly and spot contracts from various suppliers at market-based pricing. We believe access to low-cost and reliable sources of natural gas is available to meet our operations’ requirements.
We purchase electricity for all of our operations in either regulated or deregulated markets. Due to the distinct nature of these markets, we procure electricity through either long-term or annual contracts. Some operations also use self-generated coke oven gas and/or blast furnace gas to produce electricity, which reduces our need to purchase electricity from external sources. We also closely monitor developments at the state and federal levels that could impact electricity availability or cost and incorporate such changes into our electricity supply strategy in order to maintain reliable, low-cost supply. We believe there is an adequate supply of competitively priced electricity to fulfill our requirements.
We purchase industrial gases under long-term contracts with various suppliers. We believe we have access to adequate supplies of industrial gases to meet our needs.
We predominantly purchase diesel fuel for our mining operations under long-term contracts with various suppliers. We believe we have access to adequate supplies of diesel fuel to meet our needs.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 25,000 people. Approximately 24,000 were employed in the U.S., with the remainder employed in Ontario, Canada. Approximately 24,000 employees were employed at production facilities, with the balance employed in corporate support roles. The vast majority of our approximately 20,000 hourly employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements (approximately 18,500) with various labor unions. Overall, we have good relations with our workforce and the labor unions that represent our hourly employees.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. We provide our employees with competitive salaries, incentive-based bonus programs that provide above-market compensation opportunities when the Company performs well, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and a robust benefit package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition to these programs, we have used targeted, equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of key personnel. These tools have enabled us to increase the retention of key personnel, including our corporate and site leadership teams and critical technical talent.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having all employees who could perform their work remotely work from home, while implementing numerous safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work at our operations.
Safety
Safe production is our primary core value as we continue toward achieving a zero injury culture at our facilities. We constantly monitor our safety performance and make continuous improvements to affect change. Best practices and incident learnings are shared globally to ensure each facility can administer the most effective policies and procedures for enhanced workplace safety. Progress toward achieving our objectives is accomplished through a focus on proactive sustainability initiatives, and results are measured against established industry and company benchmarks, including our company-wide Total Reportable Incident Rate. During 2020, our Total Reportable Incident Rate (including contractors) was 0.92 per 200,000 hours worked.
