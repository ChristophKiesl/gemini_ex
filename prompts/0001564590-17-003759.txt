Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel medicines that can offer potentially life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients living with rare diseases or diseases of the eye, who currently have limited or burdensome treatment options. We are leveraging our industry-leading adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based platform to generate gene therapy product candidates designed to provide durable efficacy by inducing sustained expression of a therapeutic protein. We have also acquired certain other gene therapy product candidates through our acquisition on May 11, 2016, of Annapurna Therapeutics SAS (Annapurna), a privately-held French gene therapy company. Our core capabilities include clinical development and in-house manufacturing expertise, specifically in process development, assay development, and novel vector development and we are led by a team with significant drug development and gene therapy expertise.
 We are focused on advancing our three lead gene therapy programs to address unmet needs in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and in rare diseases alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency and hereditary angioedema (HAE). Our pipeline of lead and partnered gene therapy programs is shown below.
 

For wAMD, we have two new anti-VEGF gene therapy candidates, ADVM-022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) and ADVM-032 (AAV.7m8-ranibizumab). These therapies utilize a proprietary vector and are administered intravitreally for this indication. Preclinical data demonstrate that ADVM-022 and ADVM-032 have the potential to minimize the treatment burden of frequent injections and maximize visual outcomes in patients living with this disease.
 At recent scientific meetings we presented preclinical proof-of-concept data of ADVM-022 and ADVM-032’s anti-angiogenic effect in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model in non-human primates, the industry standard for testing new wAMD therapies. The data from a single injection of ADVM-022 and ADVM-032 showed efficacy that was comparable to the anti-VEGF standard of care, the positive control in the CNV model. We have selected ADVM-022 to advance in development first and we plan to initiate investigational new drug (IND)-enabling toxicology and biodistribution studies in the first half of 2017 to support a planned IND filing. We also continue to review data for our backup gene therapy for wAMD ADVM-032.
 Before focusing on these two new therapies for wet AMD, we were developing AVA-101 in a Phase 2a clinical trial in 32 patients with wet AMD. In June 2015, we announced top-line results, and although we did not observe any serious safety issues,  we also did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered (via surgical sub-retinal delivery) in the Phase 2a study. As a result, in July 2016, we announced our decision to discontinue development of AVA-101.
 With our pipeline of gene therapies for rare diseases, we are advancing ADVM-043 (formerly known as ANN-001) for the treatment of A1AT deficiency. ADVM-043 is a product candidate designed to be a single-administration treatment. This therapy has the potential to induce stable, long-term A1AT expression at therapeutic levels, as seen in preclinical proof-of-concept studies. ADVM-043 has an open IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and we plan to engage with the agency in the first half of 
 1


2017 to review our development plan. Concurrently, we are upgrading ADVM-043’s manufacturing process to a commercial-grade baculovirus-based process and plan to transfer this process to a contract manufacturing organization to produce clinical materials for our trials. We plan to initiate a toxicology study using material produced from the new baculovirus-based process in the first half of 2017 and to begin patient enrollment in a Phase 1/2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 We are also advancing ADVM-053 (formerly known as ANN-002) to treat HAE. In the first half of 2017, we plan to initiate IND-enabling studies for ADVM-053 and engage with the FDA to review our plans. We are working to transfer our manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization to produce clinical materials for our future ADVM-053 studies.
 Our earlier-stage research programs include gene therapies targeting cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich’s ataxia and severe allergy.
 Our partnered programs include vectors we are developing under collaboration agreements. Under an agreement with Editas Medicine, we are leveraging our AAV-vectors for use with Editas’ leading CRISPR-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our agreement with Regeneron provides for development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets, four of which are already identified, including AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis (XLRS).
 On May 11, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Annapurna and, as a result, Annapurna is now our wholly-owned subsidiary. At the closing of the acquisition, we issued 14,087,246 shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Annapurna, and the outstanding options or other rights to purchase capital stock of Annapurna were exchanged for options relating to shares of our common stock.
 We changed our name to “Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.” upon completion of the Annapurna transaction.
 Our Strengths
 In 2016, the transaction between Avalanche and Annapurna brought together unique and complimentary capabilities and assets to create Adverum. As a merged company, we believe we have the capabilities, resources, and expertise to enable Adverum to become a gene therapy leader. These strengths include:

• | Industry-leading capabilities in AAV technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Robust and diverse pipeline of gene therapies in ocular and rare diseases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Robust patent portfolio;
--+-------------------------


• | Proprietary vectors;
--+---------------------


• | Experienced leadership team with expertise in developing gene therapies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong cash and cash equivalents position of $222.2 million as of December 31, 2016, which is expected to fund our three lead gene therapy programs through the end of 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to transform the lives of patients through the discovery and development of novel medicines that potentially can offer life-changing therapeutic benefit to patients living with rare diseases or diseases of the eye who currently have limited or burdensome treatment options. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:

• | Focus on advancing our three lead gene therapies into clinical development. Our three lead gene therapy programs are ADVM-022 and ADVM-032 for our wAMD program, ADVM-043 for our A1AT deficiency program, and ADVM-053 for our HAE program. To advance these three gene therapies into clinical development, we plan to initiate toxicology studies and engage with the FDA to discuss our development plans. Enrollment for our first Phase 1/2 clinical trial is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2017 to evaluate ADVM-043 in patients with A1AT deficiency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish a portfolio of gene therapies for ocular and rare diseases. We have a robust and diverse pipeline of gene therapies and a leadership team with significant experience in the development of gene therapies. Our therapies are designed to deliver new, potentially single-administration treatments to patients living with ocular and rare diseases who currently have limited or burdensome treatment options. As an example, for the treatment of wAMD, the current standard-of-care treatment requires patients to receive intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF proteins every 4-8 weeks, which is difficult for patients to comply with and leads to loss of vision from underdosing. For the treatment of A1AT deficiency, the current standard-of-care treatment is weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, which leads to
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

worsening lung function from underdosing. For HAE, the current standard-of-care treatment is IV infusions of C1 Esterase Inhibitor (C1EI) 2-3 times a week, which only offer limited efficacy as patients can have breakthrough attacks, which can be deadly. Our goal is to build over time a portfolio of gene therapies to offer the potential for life-changing therapeutic benefit from a single-administration treatment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize our in-house manufacturing expertise to derisk process to support clinical and commercial product supply. Our process development capabilities are designed to develop and deliver scalable, commercial-ready processes to contract manufacturing organizations for the manufacturing of our products for clinical and eventual commercial use. For ADVM-043, we currently are upgrading our manufacturing process to a baculovirus-based process and plan to transfer this process, as well as the process for manufacturing ADVM-053, to a contract manufacturing organization to produce clinical supply for our planned trials. We also have assay development capabilities and Good Manufacturing Product (GMP) quality control to optimize product release for human use and facilitate FDA regulatory compliance from an early clinical stage of the drug development process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our earlier-stage research initiatives to leverage our industry-leading capabilities in novel vector development. We plan to continue to leverage our next-generation discovery platform and employ directed evolution to discover and manufacture novel vectors with the potential to enhance vector tropism for certain tissues and improve their antibody neutralization profile. We are also focused on discovering improved ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters and expression cassettes to offer optimal transgene expression target tissue and decrease off-target effects. Our research initiatives are also targeted at achieving production of a large amount of high-throughput libraries of novel vector variants, which are necessary for screening in large animals and/or in certain tissues. In addition, we are seeking vectors with a favorable neutralizing antibody profile. We plan to continue to use our internal expertise and relationships with thought leaders to identify additional target indications that we can develop in the future. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collaborate with partners to leverage our industry-leading ophthalmic vector development and product delivery capabilities. Under a collaboration agreement with Editas Medicine, we are leveraging our AAV vectors for use with Editas’ leading CRISPR-based genome editing technologies to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. Our collaboration agreement with Regeneron provides for the development of up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets, four of which are already identified, including AVA-311 for the treatment of juvenile XLRS. We plan to continue to explore ways to work collaboratively with these and potential new partners who may benefit from our capabilities and expertise in AAV vector development and product delivery.

Gene Therapy Background
 Gene therapy is a powerful treatment modality to address disease biology in a targeted and efficient way. Using gene therapy, physicians can introduce or re-introduce genes that encode a therapeutic protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once, or a very limited number of times, to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Once a patient’s cells have incorporated the therapeutic gene, the cells are able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years or, potentially, the rest of the patient’s life.
 Similar to existing classes of protein or biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and drug-antibody conjugates, gene therapy has taken a number of years to evolve from a research tool into a viable and compelling treatment modality. There have been several recent advances in gene therapy, including the following:
  
• | Compelling clinical data. Positive data from gene therapy have been reported in a variety of indications, including adrenoleukodystrophy, beta-thalassemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia, hemophilia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, HIV and Parkinson’s disease, as well as several ophthalmic diseases including LCA2, Choroideremia and Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased investment by biopharmaceutical companies. The modality of gene therapy has been further validated by growing interest and investments by biopharmaceutical companies. Large, global biopharmaceutical companies, such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Novartis, Sanofi, Regeneron and Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc, have increased their investment in the gene therapy field. Additionally, pure-play gene therapy companies, such as Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Dimension Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc., uniQure N.V. and Voyager Therapeutics, have attracted recent investment in this growing field.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory clarity. Although the FDA has not yet approved a human gene therapy product, it has provided guidance for the development of gene therapy products. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews.

Our Novel AAV Vector Discovery and Optimization System
 Our next-generation discovery platform is based on vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is a small, non-pathogenic virus, with the DNA encoding the AAV viral genes removed and replaced with DNA encoding a therapeutic gene. The resulting vector is used to deliver a functional gene into a desired cell population, which when expressed, will result in continuous protein production. We believe AAV vectors offer numerous advantages over other viral and non-viral vector technologies used for gene therapy. These advantages, highlighted below, have the potential to allow AAVs to be safe, to be applicable for a variety of indications and to exhibit long-term efficacy.

• | Highly-efficient transfer of DNA. AAV vectors offer highly-efficient transfer of DNA to the patient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-term expression. Once incorporated into the host cell, AAV vectors can continue to drive expression of a therapeutic protein for years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-integrating. AAV vectors do not readily integrate into the host cell’s genome, mitigating the risk of potential safety concerns.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No introduction of exogenous proteins. Therapeutic proteins are expressed by a patient’s own cells, rather than through the introduction of an exogenous protein.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-pathogenic. AAV vectors are not known to cause any disease in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Low inflammatory potential. AAV vectors elicit only a mild immune response, if any, in humans, particularly when used in the eye.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-replicating. Once inside the host cell, AAV vectors do not replicate, thereby preventing the spread to unwanted tissues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to transduce non-dividing cells. AAV vectors are able to transduce non-dividing cells and this is a significant advantage as many retinal cells cease to divide early in a person’s life.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tested in humans. AAV vectors have been used safely in more than 130 gene therapy trials to date.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AAV is naturally occurring and has become a leading vector used in gene therapy. According to the Journal of Gene Medicine, AAV has been used in over 130 clinical trials as of August 2016 demonstrating the increasing acceptance of gene therapy as a safe and effective method for delivering therapeutic genes of interest. The most frequently studied variant of AAV is AAV2, which can preferentially infect a number of cell types, including those found in the retina.
 As effective as existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there is an opportunity to advance vector capabilities beyond those currently available. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which pose limitations to their use in gene therapy.
 In order to create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. Our directed evolution technology uses a library of genes coding for viral capsid proteins found in a number of naturally occurring AAVs. We modify these capsid genes in the laboratory to derive novel viral capsid exhibiting different properties and capabilities. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, each with distinct genetic and chemical composition, we screen the AAVs in the pool for novel properties, e.g., specific transduction of a particular cell type of interest or the capability to evade pre-existing neutralizing immune response. After identifying a smaller pool of optimized vectors from this screening process, we repeat the steps of diversity generation and screening until we have identified a select number of engineered AAVs with the characteristics we seek.
 Our Product Candidates
 We have a pipeline of lead and partnered gene therapy programs in ocular and rare diseases.
 ADVM-022 and ADVM-032 for Treatment of Wet AMD
 Market for Wet AMD
 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease affecting the retinal cells in the macula, the region of the eye responsible for central vision. Disease progression results in the death of retinal cells and the gradual loss of vision. As people age, the likelihood of disease progression increases and the resulting condition is referred to as AMD.
 4


Approximately 10% of patients living with AMD have an advanced form of the disease called wet AMD (wAMD), in which blood vessels begin to invade the cellular space between layers of cells in the retina. These new blood vessels are often leaky, which results in fluid and blood in the retina and causes vision loss.
 wAMD is a leading cause of vision loss. A significant number of individuals are impacted by this disease, which has a prevalence of approximately 1.2 million individuals in the United States and 3 million on a worldwide basis. The incidence of new cases of wAMD in the United States is approximately 150,000 to 200,000 annually, and this number is expected to grow significantly based on the country’s aging population.
 Although the underlying molecular causes of AMD are not completely known, VEGF is known to play a central role in the growth of new blood vessels in wet AMD. The standard-of-care therapies for wet AMD include Lucentis® and EYLEA®, which together generated annual sales of approximately $8.4 billion for 2016, as well as off-label use of Avastin®. 
  
• | Lucentis®, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to and inhibits VEGF proteins in the eye, was approved in the United States in 2006 and in Europe in 2007. In 2016, Lucentis® achieved worldwide sales of approximately $3.2 billion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EYLEA®, a recombinant fusion protein containing portions of the human VEGF receptor that binds to VEGF, was approved in the United States in 2011. EYLEA® has exhibited strong adoption in the market due to its more convenient dosing regimen compared to Lucentis and in 2016, EYLEA® achieved worldwide sales of approximately $5.2 billion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avastin® is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF and is approved as an anti-cancer agent. Avastin® is widely prescribed off-label in ophthalmic diseases such as wAMD and makes up approximately 60% of the wet AMD market by volume.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The current treatment regimen can be burdensome, as patients generally require intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF proteins every 4-8 weeks. Compliance with this regimen can be difficult for patients and their caregivers, leading to compliance deficiencies and loss of vision from underdosing.
 Our Approach for Wet AMD
 We have two new anti-VEGF gene therapy candidates for the treatment wAMD, ADVM-022 (AAV.7m8-aflibercept) and ADVM-032 (AAV.7m8-ranibizumab). These therapies utilize a proprietary vector and are administered intravitreally, avoiding a more invasive subretinal surgery. 
 Preclinical data demonstrate that ADVM-022 and ADVM-032 have the potential to minimize the treatment burden of frequent injections and maximize visual outcomes in patients living with this disease. At The Retina Society Meeting and the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) Conference held in October 2016, we first presented preclinical proof-of-concept data of these vectors’ anti-angiogenic effect in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model in non-human primates, the industry standard for testing new wAMD therapies. In this model, choroidal neovascularization is induced experimentally using a laser, then the lesions in each eye are graded for severity, grades I-IV. The efficacy is assessed by the reduction of the number of most severe, grade IV, lesions in the eye.
 The data from this model showed that following a single injection of ADVM-022 and ADVM-032, efficacy was comparable to anti-VEGF standard of care, the positive control in the CNV model. Therapeutic protein levels are seen out to 20 weeks as measured in targeted vitreous and retinal tissue.
 We have selected ADVM-022 to advance in development first. We plan to initiate IND-enabling toxicology and biodistribution studies in the first half of 2017 to support a planned IND filing. We also continue to review data for our backup gene therapy for wAMD ADVM-032.
 ADVM-043 for Treatment of A1AT Deficiency
 Market for A1AT Deficiency
 A1AT deficiency is a fairly common orphan disease impacting approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. The disease is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, resulting in very low levels of A1AT. A1AT deficiency is associated with premature emphysema.
 5


The current standard-of-care treatment can be challenging for patients and their caregivers, with patients generally requiring weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of an alpha-1 anti-tripsin. The current treatment regimen can lead to worsening lung function which results primarily due to lack of patient compliance.
 Our Approach for A1AT Deficiency
 ADVM-043 is a product candidate designed to be a single administration treatment and has the potential to induce stable, long-term A1AT protein expression at therapeutic levels, as seen in preclinical proof-of-concept studies. In one study in mice, a single administration of ADVM-043 demonstrated robust A1AT protein expression above therapeutic levels seen from current standard-of-care treatments, with protein levels 2.5 times the therapeutic threshold. Additional data has shown hA1AT mRNA expressed in the lung following either intrapleural or intravenous administration.
 In another study in non-human primates, evidence of stable long-term expression of hA1AT mRNA was observed out to one year following intrapleural administration of ADVM-043.
 ADVM-043 has an open IND with the FDA, and we plan to engage with the agency in the first half of 2017 to review our development plan.
 In October 2016, we decided to upgrade ADVM-043’s manufacturing process to a commercial-grade baculovirus-based process. Following this upgrade, we plan to transfer this process to a contract manufacturing organization to produce clinical materials for our trials. We plan to initiate a toxicology study using material produced from the new baculovirus-based process in the first half of 2017 and plan to begin patient enrollment in a Phase 1/2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
ADVM-053 for Treatment of HAE
 
Market for HAE
 
HAE is an orphan disease impacting approximately 8,000 individuals in the United States. This disease is caused by a genetic mutation that results in low levels of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1EI). Low C1EI levels are associated with sudden swelling and edema of respiratory airways, gastrointestinal tract, and extremities.
 
The current standard-of-care prophylaxis treatment can be burdensome for patients. The treatment regimen generally requires IV infusions of C1EI (Cinryze®) 2-3 times a week, which can be difficult for patients and their caregivers, and patients may still experience breakthrough attacks. 
 A prior study demonstrated that patients treated with more frequent infusions of C1-INH can significantly decrease and, in some patients, eliminate breakthrough attacks. However, we believe a more frequent daily infusion treatment regimen is not clinically practical and other approaches are urgently needed.
 
Our Approach for HAE
 
ADMV-053 is our gene therapy product candidate for the prophylaxis treatment of HAE. ADVM-053 is designed to be administered as a single intravenous injection to prevent HAE attacks.
 In preclinical studies, a single intravenous administration of ADVM-053 showed robust C1EI expression. In a proof-of-concept study, ADVM-053 increased protein expression above anticipated therapeutic levels. An additional study, in a mice model of the disease, demonstrated that ADVM-053 decreased vascular permeability, the hallmark of this disease.
 To advance the development of ADVM-053, we plan to initiate IND-enabling studies and engage with the FDA in the first half of 2017. We are working to transfer our manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization to produce clinical materials for our future studies. After these initiatives are completed, we plan to file an IND with the FDA.
 6


Other Preclinical Product Candidates
 
In addition to our lead programs, we are developing a gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. It affects approximately 5,000 people in the United States and approximately 5,000 to 10,000 people in Europe. Currently, we are conducting observational studies and are in the early stages of preclinical development.
 We also have early-stage programs designed to treat, respectively, severe allergies and Juvenile X-linked Retinoschisis (XLRS), an inherited retinal disease that occurs almost exclusively in boys and young men and can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness that often manifests early in childhood.
 Manufacturing
 We produce our AAVs using a proprietary manufacturing process based on insect cells and baculoviruses, a common family of viruses found in invertebrates. Our process is based on the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS), which has been used in a number of FDA- and EMA-approved products. This approach is well suited for the production of large quantities of AAVs, as it takes advantage of the efficiency of viral infection coupled with the high density and scalability of insect cells grown in serum-free suspension cultures. Compared to the mammalian cell-based approaches commonly used in the field, our manufacturing process is designed to produce higher yields of vectors in a cost-effective manner.
 Our BEVS manufacturing process, using the eye as an example, is presented in the figure below.
  
1) | The process begins with two DNA constructs, one encoding the therapeutic protein and the other encoding AAV helper components for the AAV capsid and replication of vectors.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Each DNA construct is inserted into the genome of a baculorvirus to create two types of recombinant baculoviruses.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | The two baculoviruses are used to transduce Sf9 insect cells, which in turn produce large amounts of AAV vectors containing the therapeutic gene of interest.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | The transduced Sf9 insect cells are then harvested and treated with a lysis buffer solution to burst the insect cells and release the AAV vectors.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Recovered AAV vectors are then purified to remove unwanted debris.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


6) | Following purification, the vectors are formulated in a physiological solution and placed in vials.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7) | The resulting drug product is ready for use as a therapeutic treatment for the targeted disease (e.g., injection in the eye to treat wet AMD).
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEVS Manufacturing Process
 

Our AAV manufacturing method is industrialized, highly scalable and ready for adaptation for commercial stage. We believe our process provides the following advantages over competing systems:

• | Industrial-scale biologics production. Our BEVS system can produce commercial quantities by incorporating scalable, well-established process steps used throughout the industry for biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety advantages. Our BEVS system does not use mammalian cell cultures or tumorigenic cell lines, and the DNA sequences used to allow AAV vector production are inactive in mammalian cells, which lowers the risk of off-target expression from our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High yield and low cost. Our BEVS system produces a high number of particles per cell, producing many thousand doses per manufacturing run. The yields are up to one hundred times greater than those obtained using conventional AAV production systems. This lowers the unit cost of goods, allowing us to meet global demand for large markets, such as wet AMD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High purity. Our BEVS system produces a highly pure drug substance, which reduces the presence of unwanted contaminants in the final product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Precedent regulatory framework. Our BEVS system is used for several FDA- and EMA-approved vaccines and gene therapy products including FluBlok®, Cervarix® and Glybera®.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have entered into a manufacturing technology license agreement pursuant to which we and Lonza Houston, Inc. are assessing certain technology potentially useful for the manufacture of our products. The license agreement provides that the parties will conduct activities to evaluate such technology and that we may elect to engage Lonza to manufacture our products. We also granted to Lonza certain licenses to practice the manufacturing technology for products other than those being developed by us, our affiliates or sublicensees.

Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our AAV-based directed evolution platform, single-administration gene therapy candidates, and expertise in the field of gene therapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 Recently, many gene therapy companies have advanced their programs or have completed initial public offerings, which may enable these companies to compete with our platform and programs. These companies include 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc., AveXis, Inc., REGENXBIO Biosciences, Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., MeiraGTx, Spark Therapeutics, Inc., uniQure N.V., and Voyager Therapeutics.
 Our wAMD program candidates will compete with a variety of therapies currently marketed and in development for wAMD using therapeutic modalities such as biologics, small molecules and gene therapy. Existing anti-VEGF therapies, Lucentis®, EYLEA® and Avastin®, are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers as the standard-of-care treatment of patients with wAMD. To date, we are not aware of any treatment that has demonstrated a better benefit to patients than regular anti-VEGF protein delivery.
 We know of a significant number of product candidates in development for wAMD, and we group them into four main categories:
  
• | Biosimilar anti-VEGFs
--+----------------------


• | Combination / add-on therapy for efficacy improvement (for example, anti-PDGF, Anti-angiopoietin-2, topical anti-VEGF)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Next generation anti-VEGF with quarterly injection
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Implant / device to lower treatment frequency to 1-2 times per year
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several other companies with marketed products or products in development for the treatment of wAMD. These companies include Alcon, Allergan, Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Bayer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Iconic Therapeutics, Inc., Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis, Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., Ohr Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Opthea, PanOptica Pharma, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Roche (Genentech) SciFluor Life Science, LLC, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., REGENXBIO Biosciences LLC, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC.
 For the treatment of A1AT deficiency and HAE, we know of a number of products currently in development that aim to reduce the frequency of injection, improve the route of administration, and deliver better efficacy compared to the standard-of-care treatments available today. There are several companies with products for A1AT deficiency in clinical development, including Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation and Kamada Ltd. For the treatment of HAE, there are several companies with products in clinical development, including CSL Behring, Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, CSL, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, and Shire.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 9


Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Regeneron Research Collaboration and License Agreement 
 In May 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron for an initial period of three years to research, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. These products are based on our proprietary viral vectors that express transgenes encoding molecules that modulate up to a total of eight specified targets, and encoding certain endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such targets. Such products, including AVA-311, are referred to collectively as “Products.” On February 23, 2017, Regeneron notified us that, pursuant to Section 2.3 of the collaboration agreement, it is extending the research term of the Collaboration Agreement for an additional three years, through May 1, 2020.
 Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Regeneron have been conducting a research program to identify potential Products for a specified time period. Regeneron bears all costs of performing research under the Collaboration Agreement. Regeneron has a right to substitute a certain number of such targets and may, subject to a payment to us, expand the collaboration beyond the four initially designated targets to include up to four additional targets not currently being researched or developed by Adverum, and endogenous molecules known to bind to and modulate such additional targets, in the research program.
 Regeneron has an option, exercisable with respect to all Products containing transgenes expressing molecules that modulate one of the specified targets, to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to research, develop, use, import, export, make, manufacture and commercialize such Products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of human disease or other medical disorders. Regeneron may exercise this option prior to the expiration of the term of the research program, within a certain time period after the acceptance for filing with the FDA of the IND for such Products. Regeneron must pay us an option fee each time it exercises an option.
 Regeneron has the right to file an IND with the FDA for Products prior to exercising its option. If Regeneron exercises its option for specified Products, Regeneron will be primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing such Products.
 We have a right to co-fund costs of developing, manufacturing and commercializing Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a target with respect to which Regeneron has exercised its option, subject to certain exceptions. We may exercise this co-funding right up to two times. If we exercise such right, we may elect to bear up to 35% of all development costs incurred for such Products. For any co-funded Products, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the Product is no longer sold in the applicable territory. For those Products for which we exercise this option, either party may opt out of sharing development costs for all Products containing transgenes encoding molecules capable of modulating a protein target, in which case the other party may continue to develop and commercialize such Products, subject to the payment of a royalty to the other party ranging from low-single digit to low double digit royalties. While Regeneron will record all revenue from sales of the co-funded Products, Regeneron will share in the net profits and losses of sales of any Products for which we exercised our co-funding right, with each party receiving a share of profits and bearing its share of losses in accordance with the share of development costs borne by each party for such Product, provided that neither party exercises its opt-out right for such Products.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron made an initial payment of $8.0 million dollars for collaboration research costs, a one-time option fee and a one-time license grant fee.
 In addition to the initial payment, Regeneron may make the following payments to us:
  
• | Reimbursement for additional collaboration research costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Up to $80.0 million in development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward each of the eight therapeutic candidates, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight therapeutic targets subject to the Collaboration Agreement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tiered, low- to mid-single digit royalties on annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


For each Product, Regeneron’s payment obligations extend until the last to occur of the following: (i) the discontinuation of development of the Product or (ii) once a Product is approved by the FDA, the later of (x) the duration of patent coverage for the Product or (y) ten years after first commercial sale of the Product in a particular territory.
 The Collaboration Agreement will expire with respect to each collaboration target upon the earlier of the (a) expiration of the research term if the option right has not been triggered by the end of the research term or (b) expiration of the option right if the option right has not been exercised by Regeneron. If the option right has been exercised, the agreement in connection with each collaboration target will expire upon expiration of all payment obligations by Regeneron. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated (i) by Regeneron at will, either in its entirety or on a target by target basis, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us, (ii) by either party, upon written notice in connection with a material breach remaining uncured 60 days after initial written notice, (iii) by us, if Regeneron challenges the patent rights licensed by us under the Collaboration Agreement or (iv) by either party, for insolvency of the other party. 
Editas Medicine, Inc.
 In August 2016, the Company entered into a collaboration, option, and license agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. (Editas) pursuant to which the Company and Editas will collaborate on certain studies using AAV vectors in connection with Editas’ genome editing technology and the Company will grant to Editas an exclusive option to obtain certain exclusive rights to use the Company’s proprietary vectors in up to five ophthalmic indications (Indications). The Company received a $1.0 million non-refundable upfront payment, with $0.5 million of such payment to be credited against Editas’ obligation to fund research and development costs. Under the terms of the agreement, both the Company and Editas will be subject to exclusivity obligations.
 Editas may exercise the option, with respect to a designated initial Indication, until the first anniversary of the effective date of the agreement. With respect to the four other Indications, Editas may exercise the option until the third anniversary of the effective date, provided that the option will expire on the second anniversary of the effective date if Editas has not exercised the option with respect to the initial Indication or any other Indication by such date. Upon each exercise of the option, Editas will pay the Company a $1.0 million fee per Indication. If Editas elects to develop a product using certain of the Company’s proprietary vectors, the Company will be eligible to receive up to $5.5 million in development milestone payments and $10.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for such product, and tiered royalties between the mid-single digits and low teens on net sales of such product, subject to certain adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will be in effect until the later of the expiration of the option exercise period or the expiration of the royalty term of the last product. At any time after the option is first exercised, Editas may terminate the Agreement for convenience in its entirety or on an indication-by-indication or country-by-country basis, upon prior written notice to the Company. The Company may also terminate the agreement if Editas challenges the Company’s patents relating to its proprietary vectors and does not withdraw such challenge within a defined period of time. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement with written notice upon a bankruptcy of the other party or upon an uncured material breach by the other party.
 University of California License Agreement
 In May 2010, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of University of California (Regents), as amended in September 2013. Under the license agreement, the Regents have granted to us an exclusive (even as to the Regents) license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents’ undivided interest in patent rights covering a method of using recombinant gene delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye, to develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, import, export and sell products covered by such patent rights in all fields of use in the United States. The licensed patent rights are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron Corporation, but our license extends only to the Regents’ interest in such patent rights.
 Under the license agreement, we are required to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of licensed products, which includes obligations to meet certain development-stage milestones within specified periods of time, and to market the resulting licensed products in sufficient quantity to meet market demand. We have the right and option to extend the date by which we must meet any milestone by six months up to two times by paying an extension fee for each such extension.
 We have paid the Regents a license fee of $100,000. We are also obligated to make milestone payments totaling up to $900,000 upon reaching certain stages of development of the licensed products for one indication, and totaling up to $500,000 for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. Through December 31, 2016, none of these goals had been achieved, and no milestones were payable. We must also pay the Regents a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products by us or our sublicensees, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, until the patent rights upon which such royalties are based expire or are held invalid, which is currently expected to occur in 2020, subject to any potential patent term extensions. We are obligated to reimburse the Regents for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents. Finally, we are obligated to pay the Regents a mid-teen percentage of non-royalty licensing revenue we receive from sublicensees.
 11


Our license agreement with the Regents continues in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent. We may terminate this agreement without cause at any time upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement for a breach by us that remains uncured for 60 days, if we become insolvent, if we directly or through a third party file a claim that a licensed patent right is invalid or unenforceable or if we fail to meet or extend the date for meeting certain diligence milestones.
 Cornell University
 
In December 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited, a subsidiary of Annapurna, entered into three licensing agreements with Cornell, pursuant to which we are advancing gene therapy programs ADVM-043 and ADVM-053, which originally were initiated at the Department of Genetic Medicine at Weill Cornell. 
 A1AT Deficiency License Agreement: Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain technology related to A1AT deficiency and rights to an IND application to initiate clinical studies of gene therapy for A1AT.
 HAE License Agreement: Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain technology related to HAE and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the HAE program.
 Allergy License Agreement: Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited holds an exclusive license to certain patents related to allergens and a non-exclusive license to certain other technology related to allergens. 
 Across these three license agreements, Cornell is entitled to receive aggregate annual maintenance fees ranging from $30,000 to $300,000 per year, up to $16.0 million in aggregate milestone payments and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments and minimum thresholds.
 Annapurna Therapeutics Limited may terminate any of these license agreements for convenience upon ninety days written notice. Cornell may terminate any of the license agreements for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. Cornell may also terminate the HAE License Agreement and/or the Allergy License Agreement if Annapurna Therapeutics Limited commences any action and files a written claim asserting that any portion of the licensed patent rights is invalid or unenforceable.
 In August 2014 and amended and restated in December 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics, SAS entered into a master services agreement (MSA) with Cornell. This MSA included research and development support for ADVM-043, ADVM-053, our program in Freidriech’s ataxia and severe allergy and the production of clinical materials for ADVM-043 and ADVM-053. The MSA, as amended and restated, provided for Annapurna to pay Cornell $13.3 million ratably over 4 years for these services as services were performed.
 In December 2016, we informed the appropriate persons at Cornell of breach and our intention to terminate the MSA. Our three licensing agreements with Cornell for these gene therapy programs remain unchanged.
 The decision to terminate the MSA is a result of Cornell’s failure to deliver clinical materials for ADVM-043 that would be suitable for use in human patients. As a result of this decision, we are in the final stages of contracting with a large-scale contract manufacturing organization that complies with current Good Manufacturing Practice industry standards and can produce product quantities for both our planned clinical trials and potential commercial supply. This is part of our planned upgrade of the manufacturing process for ADVM-043, implementing our proprietary, highly-scalable baculovirus-based production system, in advance of our plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for ADVM-043 in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
REGENXBIO
 
A1AT Deficiency/Allergy License Agreement: In October 2015, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited entered into an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property in order to make, have made, use, import, sell, and offer for sale certain licensed products for the treatment of A1AT deficiency. Under this agreement, Annapurna Therapeutics Limited also had an option to be granted an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the treatment of severe allergies, and this option expired in October 2016 and was not exercised. Under this license agreement, REGENXBIO, Inc. (REGENXBIO) is eligible to receive annual maintenance fees, up to approximately $20.0 million in combined milestone payments and royalties in the mid-to-high single digits.
 Unless earlier terminated, this license agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration, lapse, abandonment, or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse, or become abandoned or unenforceable for the applicable licensed product. Annapurna Therapeutics Limited may terminate this license agreement upon six months’ prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate this license agreement if Annapurna Therapeutics Limited is a specified number of days late in paying money due under the license agreement, or if Annapurna Therapeutics Limited, its affiliates, or any sublicensees become insolvent or, effective immediately, if they commence any action against REGENEXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate this license agreement for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days.
 12


Friedreich’s Ataxia License Agreement: In April 2014, Annapurna entered into an exclusive worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA) program to make, have made, use, import, sell, and offer for sale licensed products using AAVrh10 for FA where the vector is administered by any route except directly to the central nervous system (FA Systemic).
 Under the terms of this license agreement, Annapurna also had an option to obtain a non-exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, sell and offer for sale licensed products using a single vector for each of FA where the vector is administered directly to the central nervous system (FA CNS) and FA Systemic. The option to obtain a non-exclusive license to FA Systemic expired in April 2015 and the option to obtain a non-exclusive license for FA CNS expired in April 2016. 
 Under this license agreement, REGENXBIO is eligible to receive annual maintenance fees, up to $13.9 million in combined milestone fees and royalties in the mid-to-high single digits. Annapurna is obligated to achieve certain development milestones with respect to each licensed disease indication, including the filing of an IND for each licensed disease indication within a specified time period, which Annapurna may extend for additional time for a specified number of extensions upon the payment of a fee.
 Unless earlier terminated, this license agreement expires upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment, or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property to expire, lapse, or become abandoned or unenforceable in all the countries of the world. Annapurna may terminate this license agreement upon six months’ prior written notice. REGENXBIO may terminate this license agreement if Annapurna is a specified number of days late in paying money due under the license agreement, or if Annapurna, its affiliates, or any sublicensees become insolvent or, effective immediately, if they commence any action against REGENXBIO or its licensors to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid or unenforceable. Either party may terminate this license agreement for material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days.
 Inserm Transfert
 
In July 2014, Annapurna entered into an agreement with Inserm Transfert (Inserm) whereby Annapurna holds an exclusive license to certain patents to develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell or otherwise distribute products for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia and a non-exclusive license to certain other intellectual property related to the FA program. The agreement was amended in October 2015 to increase the scope of the intellectual property under the licenses. Under this agreement, Inserm is entitled to receive certain de minimis license payments, certain development milestone payments of up to approximately €2.0 million in the aggregate and royalties on sales in the low single-digits, subject to adjustments.
 Unless earlier terminated, this agreement will be in effect on a country-by-country, licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the expiration of the last claim of the licensed intellectual property which cover the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country in which such product is sold. Upon a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, Annapurna will have a fully paid up, perpetual, irrevocable license with respect to such product in such country under the licensed intellectual property following expiration of this agreement with respect to such product in the applicable country. Annapurna may terminate this agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice. Inserm may terminate this license agreement if Annapurna becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy or fails to meet development milestones and such failure is not cured within a specified number of days. Inserm may also terminate the license granted to Annapurna in a given country if Annapurna (i) before regulatory approval of a product in any country, has ceased conducting any development of products in all countries for 12 consecutive months or (ii) after regulatory approval of a product in a given country, has ceased marketing such product in such country for 12 consecutive months.
 Pursuant to Section 4.7 of the agreement with Inserm, our acquisition of Annapurna triggered a one-time payment to Inserm of €250,000.
 Intellectual Property 
 Overview
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 13


Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 We have more than 60 patent applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 38 patent applications have been filed in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 12 patents have been issued to us or to our licensors that are active. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing our AAV-based products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.
 Company-owned Intellectual Property 
 We own a family of patent applications that are directed to AAV-based compositions and methods for treating or preventing eye diseases associated with neovascularization. The applications in this family relate to an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD using an anti-VEGF composition, various unit dosages, dosing regimens and routes of administration. Four applications in this family are pending in the United States, and corresponding patent applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and South Africa. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 We are also pursuing innovative ways to regulate the expression of transgenes in tissues. To that end, we have, in collaboration with Stanford University, filed a U.S. patent application that is directed to methods for regulating gene expression in a subject. Any patents that grant from this application are expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 Licensed Intellectual Property
 We have obtained exclusive licenses to patents directed to both compositions of matter and methods of use.
 For example, we have exclusively licensed the rights of the Regents to a U.S. patent directed to methods of treating ocular disease that relate to methods of using an AAV gene therapy approach. This patent is co-owned by the Regents and by Chiron Corporation, and will expire in 2020, unless a term extension is obtained for such patent. There are no foreign patents in this patent family.
 We have exclusively licensed several families of patents and applications that relate to variant rAAV virions having desirable characteristics, such as increased infectivity, as well as novel methods to screen for such variants.
 One patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes granted patents in Australia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain; three pending U.S. patent applications; and a pending patent application in Canada. The patents are projected to expire in 2024, subject to possible patent term extensions, as are any patents that granted from the pending applications.
 Another patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes a granted U.S. patent that is projected to expire in 2031 and a pending U.S. patent application which, if granted, is also projected to expire in 2031, in both cases subject to possible patent term extensions.
 A third patent family that we have exclusively licensed includes three pending U.S. patent applications and pending corresponding applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2032, subject to possible patent term extensions.
 14


We have also nonexclusively licensed rights to a patent family that includes an issued European patent and related Chinese and U.S. patent applications directed to methods of manufacturing. The European patent is expected to expire in 2027, as are any patents that may grant from the related patent applications.
 We have exclusively licensed intellectual property related to gene therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency including Investigational New Drug Application No. 016008. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for hereditary angioedema (C1-esterase deficiency), which includes pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patent applications related to gene therapy treatments for severe allergies, which includes pending U.S. and foreign applications. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2036, subject to patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have exclusively licensed a family of patents and applications related to the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Friedrich’s ataxia. This family includes a granted US patent and pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Mexico, New Zealand, United States and South Africa. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2033, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments.
 We have also exclusively licensed a patent family directed to the use of certain rAAVs for use in Friedrich’s ataxia (systemic) including pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hungary, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2022, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments. 
 We have also exclusively licensed a patent family directed to the use of certain rAAVs for use in the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, including pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hungary, Israel, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. Patents that grant from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2022, subject to possible patent term extensions and adjustments.
 Trademark Protection
 We have registered trademarks in connection with our biological products. We may pursue additional registrations for future products in markets of interest. In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
Trade Secret Protection
 Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of our product candidates. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates.
 15


In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the FDA implements regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Our product candidates may be subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the United States. Similarly, FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States.
 Within the FDA, CBER regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (formerly known as the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies), and FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, viral shedding, environmental assessments, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. FDA guidance documents provide the agency's current thinking about a particular subject, but are not legally binding. However, products in this area are novel and present highly complex scientific and medical issues, making the predictability of FDA’s policies and practices in this area less certain.
 The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
  
• | Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the purity, potency, safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Before testing any biologic product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.

Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation are submitted to, and the study is registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC's decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The OBA notifies the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the content(s) of the IND that could potentially expose human research subjects to health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the IND goes into effect and the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold on an IND, clinical trials may not commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by FDA.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. Clinical testing also must satisfy the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, including the requirements for informed consent from all subjects. FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an application for marketing approval if (i) the study was conducted in accordance with GCP as further detailed in the regulation, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and (ii) if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. In addition, FDA requires that a sponsor or applicant who submits data from a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND as support for a marketing application submit, in addition to other required information, a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Further, where a sponsor intends for marketing approval of a new drug to be based solely on foreign clinical data, additional requirements apply that are described in FDA regulations.
 Clinical Trials
 For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1: Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored studies that are generally conducted in a limited subject population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse subject population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after the product’s approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the product. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing or post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials.
 Per the regulations, a sponsor of a sponsor (in industry or academia) of a clinical trial must register a clinical trial on the ClinicalTrial.gov website, the registry of new and on-going clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and device products. Sponsors are required to maintain the currency of the posting of the clinical trials posted on-line in the registry. This clinical trial registry and results data bank for clinical trials also contains summary results information on a clinical trial including adverse event information from the clinical trials and for pediatric post-market surveillance of a device product. The registry also provides information that helps patients find trials for which they might be eligible, enhance the design of clinical trials and prevent duplication of unsuccessful or unsafe trials, improve the evidence base that informs clinical care, increase the efficiency of drug and device development processes, improve clinical research practice, and build public trust in clinical research.
 These phases of testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Biologics License Applications (BLA) 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless a waiver applies, and is subject to a sixty day review period to determine if the application is substantially complete to permit substantive review.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has a performance goal to review applications within 6 months (for priority reviews) or 10 months (for standard reviews). The review timeline begins upon FDA’s acceptance of the original application submission for filing, no later than 60 calendar days from the date FDA receives the application. In some instances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended depending on the information required in order the FDA reviewers to complete their review of the BLA.
 The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, which may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Moreover, even if a product receives approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited or subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of any biologic or drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic or drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished biologic or drug product, and sometimes, for drug products, the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the product unless compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements is satisfactory.
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the biologics or drugs. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 In addition, prior to submitting a BLA for a new biologic, a sponsor may be able to take advantage of one or more FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition (e.g., priority review, fast track designation) provided the product meets the criteria for those programs. While some of these programs have been in existence for a number of years, Congress established additional programs intended to expedite the development of drugs and biologics in the recently enacted 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which was signed into law on December 13, 2016. Notably with respect to gene therapy products, section 3012 of the Cures Act clarifies the authority of FDA to facilitate the development, review, and approval of “genetically targeted drugs” and “variant protein targeted drugs” to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups, including subgroups of patients with different mutations of a gene, with respect to rare diseases or conditions that are serious or life-threatening. 21st Century Cures Act Section 3033 also 
 19


established a regenerative advanced therapy designation process intended to expedite the development of regenerative medicine therapies, defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and part 1271 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, that are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic and drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Under FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, in proactively promoting a drug, a company generally can make only those substantiated claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications approved by the FDA and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug or biologic. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and impact our financial results.
 In addition, recent events in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry generally have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices and the U.S. Senate is investigating several pharmaceutical companies relating to drug price increases and pricing practices. If we obtain regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. In addition, following the November 2016 Presidential election in the United States, significant uncertainty exists regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that there will be legislation in the future either to amend or replace the Affordable Care Act and that such new legislation will be generally unfavorable toward the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (including with regard to a possible reduction in the number of insured individuals with access to drug coverage or additional measures aimed at high cost drug and biologic products). At this time, it is unclear whether those changes will also have an impact on biologic product exclusivity or the biosimilar product licensure pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.
 21


The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one reference member state (RMS), and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competing Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Under the centralized procedure, within 120 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we or our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
 Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous materials. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Although the costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements in the European Union relating to the restriction of use of hazardous substances in products, have not been material, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
Employees
 As of February 28, 2017, we had 61 full-time employees, including a total of 12 employees with M.D., DVM or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 42 employees are engaged in research and development and 19 in business development, finance, legal, human resources, facilities, information technology and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Corporate and Available Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 2006 under the name “Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc.” We completed the initial public offering of our common stock in August 2014. On May 11, 2016, upon the completion of our acquisition of Annapurna Therapeutics SAS, we changed our name to “Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.” Our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “ADVM” We are an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and therefore we are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.
