ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Launched in 2017, Hims & Hers has built a proprietary solution that connects consumers to licensed healthcare professionals for care across numerous specialties, including mental health, sexual health, dermatology, and primary care, among others. Since its founding, the Company has facilitated more than two million telehealth consultations, enabling greater access to high quality, convenient, and affordable care for people in all 50 states. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020 and prior to the Merger, OAC was a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
 Recent Developments 
 On January 20, 2021, we consummated the Merger. At the effective time of the Domestication, among other things, each stockholder of OAC received one share of our Class A common stock for each Class A ordinary share of OAC. Each outstanding warrant exercisable for OAC Class A ordinary shares became exercisable for an equal number of shares of our Class A common stock. 
 The PIPE Investment was consummated substantially concurrently with the Closing. Immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination and the PIPE Investment, there were 181,487,235 shares of our Class A common stock, 8,377,623 shares of our Class V common stock and 10,608,958 Warrants (including public and private placement warrants) outstanding. 
 In connection with the Closing, OAC changed its name to Hims & Hers Health, Inc. Our Class A common stock is now listed on the NYSE under the symbol HIMS and warrants to purchase the Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share are listed on the NYSE under the symbol HIMS WS. 
 Business Strategy after the Merger 
 Hims & Hers offers a range of health and wellness products and services available for purchase on its websites directly by customers. The offerings generally focus on chronic conditions, where treatment typically involves use of prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. Hims & Hers also offers over-the-counter drug and device products and cosmetics and supplement products, which are primarily focused on wellness, sexual health, skincare, and hair care. These curated non-prescription products include vitamin C, melatonin, biotin, collagen protein and teas in the wellness category, moisturizer, fragrances, face wash and anti-wrinkle cream in the skincare category, condoms and lubricants in the sexual health category and shampoos, conditioners, scalp scrubs and topical treatments such as minoxidil in the hair care category. The over-the-counter drug and device products and some of the cosmetics and supplement products Hims & Hers sells are white-labeled products, where Hims & Hers sells the manufacturer-developed product under the Hims & Hers brand name or co-branded along with the manufacturers brand. Several cosmetics and supplement products have been developed by Hims & Hers in partnership with the manufacturer. For these products, the manufacturer develops the formulation with input from the internal Hims & Hers Product Research & Development team. In all cases, the manufacturer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the FDA authorization, if required, and complying with current Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMP) adopted and enforced by the FDA. Hims & Hers maintains an internal Quality program, under which it ensures independent laboratory testing of non-prescription products for compliance with quality standards, periodically evaluate non-prescription product suppliers for compliance with cGMP and other quality standards, and address product complaints and adverse events reported by customers.

 Most of the offerings on the Hims & Hers websites are sold to customers on a subscription basis. Subscription plans provide an easy and convenient way for customers to get the ongoing treatment they need while simultaneously providing the company with predictability through a recurring revenue stream. 
 For subscription plans, customers select a desired cadence to receive products, which can range from every month to every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed on a recurring basis based on the selected cadence and a specified quantity of product is shipped at each billing. Customers can cancel subscriptions in between billing periods to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products. Hims & Hers integrated technology platform allows it to serve its customers efficiently from start to finish: initially from customer discovery and purchase of offerings on its websites, to connecting customers with medical providers for telehealth consultations, to the fulfilment and delivery of customer orders, and finally through ongoing clinical management by medical providers. This technology-driven efficiency provides cost advantages that allow Hims & Hers to offer customers affordable prices and to generate robust gross margins. 
 Hims & Hers acquires new customers and drives brand awareness through various marketing channels, including social media, online search, television, radio, and other media channels. The Company intends to invest in growth in its current offerings and additionally in new products and services. The Hims & Hers platform is purpose-built to scale efficiently and to accommodate the seamless addition of new products and services. Hims & Hers plans to launch new subscription-based offerings which it expects will have a similar margin profile and unit economics to current offerings. As it implements its product roadmap, Hims & Hers expects to grow revenue through additional subscription-based recurring revenue offerings. The recent launches of new products and services in behavioral health, dermatology, and primary care demonstrate the scalability of the platform. 
 Growth Opportunities 
 Continue to acquire more customers 
 Customers serve as ambassadors for the Hims & Hers brand, further driving organic growth through word of mouth and user-generated content. The convenience of the Hims & Hers websites allows the Company to reduce stigma and access-related barriers that frequently prevent consumers from seeking medical care, expanding the Companys market opportunity. Organic growth is enhanced by sophisticated omni-channel acquisition strategies meant to target future customers with condition specific on-ramps at profitable returns on investment. In addition, Hims & Hers brand positioning has afforded significant partnerships with leading talent whose promotional efforts drive meaningful awareness of the products and services Hims & Hers makes available. As its portfolio of products and services grows across categories, Hims & Hers believes that its market presence and brand recognition will expand, driving more consumers to seek out the Company for future healthcare needs. 
 Grow within existing customer base 
 Hims & Hers customer base represents the future of healthcare and differentiates the Company. Approximately 80% of customers to date indicate that they came to Hims & Hers to learn about and find options for their condition and are seeking treatment for their particular conditions for the first time. In addition, the majority of Hims & Hers customers are millennials at the beginning of their healthcare journey and Hims & Hers intends to grow with them as their healthcare needs evolve. Hims & Hers believes this demographic will make up the majority of healthcare spend in the coming decades, and as such it has intentionally built its brand and technologies to align with the expectations of this consumer group. 
 Category expansion into new chronic conditions 
 Hims & Hers is pursuing a roadmap of rapid category expansion into new chronic and often stigmatized conditions that can be treated safely via telehealth, require ongoing and recurring customer relationships, and for

  which generic medication has been established as an effective means of treatment. Future chronic care opportunities that show high prevalence within Hims & Hers existing customer base and offer traits similar to its existing categories in terms of business model characteristics include sleep disorders, infertility, diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension, which represent significant opportunities. With approximately 130 million individuals in the United States currently suffering from chronic conditions, Hims & Hers sees a large market opportunity for its current and future offerings. 
 Leverage existing capabilities to penetrate new sales channels and further improve operations 
 The strength of the Hims & Hers brand affords the Company numerous opportunities to partner with and offer new solutions to help transform existing healthcare stakeholders. Hims & Hers has relationships with leading health systems including Ochsner Health and Mount Sinai Health System to provide a clinically focused, telehealth-enabled patient care collaboration, providing customers with access to applicable in-person care within these systems to enhance their overall healthcare experience. These collaborations, which are intended to help Hims & Hers customers obtain in-person care not accessible through the Hims & Hers platform, do not involve any monetary exchange, compensation or other financial incentives between the parties. 
 Hims & Hers also recently opened an approximately 300,000 square foot facility in Columbus, Ohio that will house a dedicated pharmacy, enable seamless drug delivery, and drive increased operating leverage across the platform. This pharmacy will also provide an opportunity to incorporate insurance reimbursement into Hims & Hers system, increasing drug coverage and allowing the Company to provide access to treatment for a broader range of conditions with enhanced treatment flexibility for customers. 
 Expand into new geographies 
 Hims & Hers strong brand and digital-first, cloud-based business model has driven rapid adoption in the U.S. Additionally, the Companys model has been developed to be scalable and applicable across new markets and languages which would allow Hims & Hers to expand internationally. The global market for chronic diseases is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, and Hims & Hers believes the consumer-focused services it provides are applicable to a range of geographies across the world. 
 Affiliated Medical Groups, Providers and Partner Pharmacies 
 Affiliated Medical Groups 
 Due to the prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine adopted by a majority of states in the U.S., Hims & Hers has contractual arrangements with Affiliated Medical Groups to enable their provision of clinical services to Hims & Hers customers. The Affiliated Medical Groups are separate professional entities owned solely by licensed physicians. Hims & Hers is prohibited from owning a professional entity such as the Affiliated Medical Groups under the rules prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine. However, the Affiliated Medical Groups were incorporated and established with Hims & Hers assistance for the specific purpose of providing clinical services to patients through the Hims & Hers platform and have no other operations or activities outside of the provision of services through the Hims & Hers platform. 
 The Affiliated Medical Groups contract with or employ physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to provide telehealth consultations and related services on the Hims & Hers platform. Hims & Hers enters into certain contractual agreements with the Affiliated Medical Groups and their physician owners, including administrative services agreements and continuity agreements, under which Hims & Hers serves as an administrative services manager for the Affiliated Medical Groups for the non-clinical aspects of their operations and receives a fixed administrative fee from each Affiliated Medical Group for these services. The administrative services and support Hims & Hers provides include IT products and support, including the Hims & Hers platform and electronic medical record system, billing and collection services, non-clinical personnel, customer service 
 
6 


  support, administrative support for provider credentialing and quality assurance, and other non-clinical items and services, including access to a line of credit Hims & Hers makes available to the Affiliated Medical Groups as necessary to support their operations. The Affiliated Medical Groups retain sole control of clinical decision-making and the practice of medicine and pay the providers on an hourly basis for clinical services provided through the platform. Hims & Hers is the exclusive administrative services provider for the Affiliated Medical Groups, and the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services to patients exclusively through the platform. Hims & Hers arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups generally have initial 10-year terms with renewal options. The arrangements between Hims & Hers and the Affiliated Medical Groups are reviewed and updated periodically to address changing regulatory or market conditions. Hims & Hers consolidates all of the financial results of the Affiliated Medical Groups with its own based upon its determination that the Affiliated Medical Groups are variable interest entities and that Hims & Hers is the primary beneficiary of the Affiliated Medical Groups for accounting purposes. 
 Partner Pharmacies 
 Hims & Hers has entered into contractual arrangements with two licensed pharmacies, PostMeds, Inc. (dba TruePill) and EHT Pharmacy, LLC (dba Curexa Pharmacy) for fulfillment and distribution of certain prescription and non-prescription products available through its platform. Hims & Hers is not bound by any exclusivity or minimum order requirements with respect to its use of either pharmacy, and has the ability to utilize other pharmacies at its discretion. The contractual arrangements with the pharmacies are typically for one-year terms with automatic renewals, subject to standard termination rights of the parties. The pharmacies rates are fixed in the contractual arrangements and changes require the mutual agreement of the parties. 
 In October 2020, the Company also entered into service agreements with XeCare LLC (XeCare), a licensed mail order pharmacy which is expected to provide prescription fulfillment services solely to the Companys customers beginning in 2021. As such, XeCare was also determined to be a variable interest entity and Hims and Hers consolidates all of the financial results of XeCare as the primary beneficiary of the entity. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 As a consumer-driven healthcare organization delivering comprehensive telehealth technologies and services, in addition to the typical legal and regulatory considerations faced by a technology-based company, Hims & Hers is required to comply with complex healthcare laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. Hims & Hers business and its operations are subject to extensive regulation, including with respect to the practice of medicine, the use of telehealth, relationships with healthcare providers, and privacy and security of personal health information. 
 Government regulation of healthcare generally 
 Generally speaking, the healthcare industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. Healthcare businesses are subject to a broad array of governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. While portions of Hims & Hers business are subject to significant regulations, some of the more well-known healthcare regulations do not apply to the Company because of the way its current operations are structured. Hims & Hers currently accepts payments only from its customersnot any third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs or health insurers. Because of this approach, Hims & Hers is not subject to many of the laws and regulations that impact other participants in healthcare industry. 
 Irrespective of Hims & Hers business model, the healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect healthcare companies like Hims & Hers. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and subject to potential disruption due to legislative initiatives and government regulation, as well as judicial interpretations thereof. While these regulations may not directly impact Hims & Hers or its offerings in any given case, they will affect 
 
7 


  the healthcare industry as a whole and may impact customer use of the Companys solutions. If the government asserts broader regulatory control over companies like Hims & Hers or if Hims & Hers determines that it will accept payment from and/or participate in third-party payor programs, the complexity of the Companys operations and its compliance obligations will materially increase. 
 Government regulation of the practice of medicine and telehealth 
 The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the qualifications of the provider, the practice of medicine (including specific requirements when providing health care utilizing telehealth technologies and the provision of remote care), the continuity and adequacy of medical care, the maintenance of medical records, the supervision of personnel, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. Because the practice of telehealth is relatively new and rapidly developing, regulation of telehealth is evolving and the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and standards can be uncertain or uneven. As a result, Hims & Hers must continually monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments regarding the practice of medicine and telehealth in order to support the Affiliated Medical Groups. 
 Physicians and midlevel providers (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners) who provide professional medical services via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. Hims & Hers has established systems to assist the Affiliated Medical Groups in ensuring that its providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to Hims & Hers customers occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some state and federal regulatory authorities lowered certain barriers to the practice of telehealth in order to make remote healthcare services more accessible. Due to the Hims & Hers business model, these changes did not dramatically change the Companys operations, but these changes did introduce many people to the practice of telehealth. It is unclear whether these changes will have a long-term impact on the adoption of telehealth services by the general public or legislative and regulatory authorities. 
 Corporate practice of medicine laws in the U.S.; Fee splitting 
 In certain jurisdictions, the corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits non-physicians from practicing medicine, including by employing physicians to provide clinical services, directing the clinical practice of physicians, or holding an ownership interest in an entity that employs physicians. Other practices, such as professionals splitting their professional fees with non-professional persons or entities, is also prohibited in some jurisdictions. These laws are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or unduly influencing a physicians professional judgment. State laws and enforcement activities related to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting vary dramatically. In some states, even activities not directly related to the delivery of clinical services may be considered an element of the practice of medicine. For example, in some states the corporate practice of medicine restrictions may be implicated by non-clinical activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel. 
 Because of the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine doctrine and fee-splitting in various jurisdictions, Hims & Hers does not employ the healthcare providers who provide clinical services on the Hims & Hers platform. Instead, the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services on the platform and Hims & Hers contracts with but does not own the Affiliated Medical Groups. The Affiliated Medical Groups and their providers maintain exclusive authority regarding the provision of healthcare services (including consults that may lead to the writing of prescriptions) and remain responsible for retaining and compensating their physicians and midlevel providers, credentialing decisions regarding their providers, maintaining professional standards, maintaining clinical documentation within medical records, establishing their own fee schedule, and submitting accurate information to Hims & Hers so that it can bill customers. Despite Hims & Hers care in structuring 
 
8 


  arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups, it is possible that a regulatory authority or another party, including providers affiliated with Affiliated Medical Groups, could assert that Hims & Hers (or other organizations with similar business models) is engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with Affiliated Medical Groups violate a states fee-splitting prohibition. Failure to comply with these state laws could lead to materially adverse consequences. 
 U.S. Federal and State fraud and abuse laws 
 Participants in the United States healthcare industry are subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to kickbacks, physician self-referral arrangements, false claims and other fraud and abuse issues. For example, the federal anti-kickback law (the Anti-Kickback Law) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The penalties for violating these laws can be severe, including criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. 
 Given Hims & Hers current operations and the current state of this federal law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claim Act and other laws that are tied to federal health care program or commercial insurer reimbursement should not apply to Hims & Hers business. If the scope of these laws is extended to include a broader spectrum of activities or if Hims & Hers changes it business model to accept payments from third-party payors such as a government program, it could become subject to these laws and need to modify its business model. 
 FDA regulation 
 The products available through the Hims & Hers platform are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and are subject to the limitations placed by the FDA on the approved uses in the product prescribing information. The FDA regulates product promotion and noncompliance with the FDAs regulations could result in the FDA requesting that Hims & Hers modify product promotion or subjecting it to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities monitor product promotion and have the authority to levy significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement, if violations of applicable law or regulations occur. 
 U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws 
 Numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, and other processing of health information. Hims & Hers believes that, because of its operating processes, it is not a covered entity or a business associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the implementing regulations (HIPAA), which establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notwithstanding that Hims & Hers does not believe that it meets the definition of a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, it has executed business associate agreements with certain other parties and has assumed obligations that are based upon HIPAA-related requirements. Because Hims & Hers needs to use and disclose customers health and personal information in order to provide its services, it has developed and maintains policies and procedures to protect that information, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards.

 In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of health information and other types of personal information. These laws and regulations can be more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and its implementing rules. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changed or differing interpretations, and Hims & Hers expects new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future. 
 Marketing 
 Hims & Hers is building brands that represent the front door to the healthcare system for a new generation of healthcare customers. From the launch of the Company, Hims & Hers has used a diverse marketing strategy to reach its customers. Hims & Hers advertises on social media, online search, television, radio, out-of-home, and other media channels. Hims & Hers believes advertising in a diversified set of media channels is important to prevent over reliance on any single channel and to maximize the exposure of its brands to its desired customers. Hims & Hers also reaches its customers through its own social media accounts, press coverage and public relations, and internally developed educational and lifestyle content. This overall strategy drives significant customer traffic to its websites, including direct type-in traffic and organic online search traffic. 
 Hims & Hers marketing strategy is underpinned by a focus on analytics and data. Hims & Hers has built its team and systems to measure consumer behavior: which types of consumers generate more revenue in their first purchase, generate more revenue over time, generate more gross profit from their purchases, and which types of consumers are most valuable over their lifetime. Hims & Hers also rigorously measures the effectiveness of its marketing budgets and the rate of return it generate from its marketing campaigns. The marketing team is accountable for driving a sufficient rate of return from their budgets. Hims & Hers views its marketing capabilities as a core strength of the Company and key differentiator in the market. 
 People and Culture 
 People and culture 
 Hims & Hers strives to hire the best and brightest talent across the industry with a focus on like-minded individuals determined to improve the health of millions. Hims & Hers team is highly diverse and as of December 31, 2020, was comprised of 181 full-time employees across various functions. Hims & Hers work environment is one of mutual trust, confidence, and inclusion to provide opportunity for growth and recognition, with the ultimate goal of delivering better healthcare to more consumers. 
 Hims & Hers has a strong focus on building a diverse and inclusive workforce and seek individuals who are differentiated in their excitement to be leading the charge into a consumer-focused healthcare future. Hims & Hers is also a remote-first organization that has heavily invested in the software, tools, and culture that allow it to be a leading force in the new remote-oriented work environment. Not only has this allowed Hims & Hers to maintain and enhance its commitment to quality, it has also provided a real competitive advantage by attracting top talent and garnering new geographic exposure. 
 Commitment to highest standards of provider quality 
 In addition to its employees, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 220 medical providers located throughout all 50 states in the U.S. provided services on Hims & Hers platform through the Affiliated Medical Groups. These medical professionals adhere to a rigorous set of assessments and all credentials, licenses, and qualifications are cross-checked against federal, state, and other agencies. The Affiliated Medical Groups implement comprehensive processes, including written testing, to ensure adequate clinical skill and quality. Testing results are reviewed by an advisory board of physicians, with only the most qualified applicants approved 
 
10 


  by the Affiliated Medical Groups to provide consultations on Hims & Hers platform. This rigor in provider selection ensures a strong culture of high standards focused around improving healthcare outcomes for Hims & Hers customers. 
 Competition 
 Consumers have historically accessed the healthcare system in the U.S. through an antiquated model focused around brick-and-mortar healthcare providers and cost coverage through commercial and government payor programs. At the same time, many consumers are not aware of the relative affordability, convenience, and accessibility of care through the use of telehealth. Much of Hims & Hers marketing efforts since its founding have thus focused on consumer education around these capabilities and the underlying chronic and often stigmatized conditions that providers on its platform can help treat. The relatively low (albeit rapidly increasing) penetration of telehealth implies that there is a significant market opportunity as consumers continue to shift their behavior. 
 While Hims & Hers does not believe there are currently any direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions and direct-to-consumer touch points as it does, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address chronic conditions that compete with Hims & Hers solutions. 
 

 | In direct-to-consumer healthcare, Hims & Hers competition is largely fragmented and consists of many competitors that are smaller in scale and/or are more niche in focus with respect to the conditions they treat. Within parts of the sexual health and hair loss market, Hims & Hers also competes mostly with private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In telehealth and chronic disease management, Hims & Hers competes with other providers that are larger in scale and generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 Hims & Hers ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for its proprietary technology platform, preserve the confidentiality of its trade secrets, and operate without violating the intellectual property rights of others is important to its success. Hims & Hers has a number of measures to protect its intellectual property and brand, including trademarks, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, to establish and protect its proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that it will adequately protect its intellectual property. 
 As of December 31, 2020, Hims & Hers held 10 registered trademarks in the U.S. and 10 in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 13 pending trademarks in the U.S. and eight in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including pending trademarks for its brand, Hims & Hers. In addition, Hims & Hers has registered domain names for websites that it uses in its business, such as www.forhims.com and www.forhers.com. Hims & Hers holds no patents at this time.
