Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a leading provider of Business Spend Management (“BSM”) solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected our customers with more than seven million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money, optimize supply chains, and manage liquidity. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability.
Our BSM platform is designed for the modern global workforce that is mobile and expects real-time results, flexibility, and agility from software solutions. The look, feel and functionality of our intuitive, mobile and browser-based interface evoke a familiar e-commerce experience that is intended to appeal to users across an entire organization, rather than just a small group of power users with specialized training. The simplicity and accessibility of our solution encourages widespread adoption within an organization—and the broader the user adoption, the more spend under management that an organization achieves. In this way, our user-centric approach enables organizations to gain greater control over their procurement, invoicing, payment and other related spend activities, and to manage these processes more efficiently than with traditional, legacy solutions. By de-centralizing BSM workflows and removing unnecessary complexity, our platform reduces an organization’s dependence on its often-backlogged back-office functions, and empowers personnel across the organization to source and purchase goods and services on their own—without sacrificing visibility and control over spending. 
Our BSM platform delivers a broad range of capabilities that would typically require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment solutions that form the transactional engine for managing a company’s business spend. In addition, our platform offers specialized solutions targeted for power users, to help companies manage more technical and strategic areas of BSM, including areas such as strategic sourcing, contract management, contingent workforce, inventory management, supplier risk management, supply chain design and planning, treasury management, and spend analysis. 
We benefit from powerful network effects as our customer and supplier populations continue to grow. As more businesses subscribe to our BSM platform, the collective spend under management on our platform grows. The greater the total amount of spend under management on our platform, the more attractive our platform is to suppliers. As more suppliers join our platform, our buyers benefit from a broader range of purchasing options, which in turn encourages greater use of our platform by existing customers, while also attracting new customers to our platform. In addition, the increasing number of transactions on our platform leads to incrementally powerful prescriptive spend insights and risk management recommendations from our Coupa Community.ai capabilities, creating more value for customers and providing additional incentives for increased adoption. As we generate more revenue from the increase in customer subscriptions to our services, we are able to make greater investments into our platform, for example, to add new features or improve the functionality and user interface of our solutions, and these enhancements further encourage greater adoption of our platform by businesses, enhancing the network effects that benefit all constituencies.
Our customers benefit from our rapidly growing network in a multitude of ways. We describe the ecosystem of business buyers, suppliers and partners that use our services as a “community.” Like any community, each member can contribute value to the community, and can also benefit, directly or indirectly, from the participation of other members of the community. For example, through programs that leverage group buying power; through recommendations based on insights extracted from anonymized data on transactions occurring within the platform; and through access to community message boards and channels for direct communication between community participants. Our Community.ai offering provides two sets of broad capabilities for each community member to benefit from the collective power of our entire community - Community Insights and Community Connections. Our Community Insights capabilities apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to spend transactions across the growing Coupa community to identify trends and prescribe best practices that help customers optimize spend, reduce risk, and improve efficiency. Additionally, through our Community Connections capabilities, we provide purchasing programs, such as Coupa Instant Advantage, which offers access to pre-negotiated discounts from various suppliers, and Coupa Sourcing Advantage, which connects community members to engage in group sourcing events, allowing them to leverage pooled buying power to achieve better contracting terms and capture greater savings. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can list their goods and services, establish pricing, and interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies, and reducing costs.
We believe a critical, differentiating feature of Coupa’s approach to BSM is our company culture. That culture is built on three guiding principles we refer to as our core values: (1) ensuring customer success, (2) focusing on results; and (3) striving for excellence. We emphasize these principles continuously through formal training and informal messaging within the organization, and the results of our annual employee surveys consistently demonstrate that our employees have adopted and strive to embody them. These principles inform how we treat each other within our organization, and how we approach interactions with our customers, suppliers, partners, and others with whom we do business. Our unwavering focus on customer success means that we expect to deliver quantifiable business value to our customers by helping them maximize their spend under management. We believe this mindset serves as the foundation for the successful execution of our strategy, and, as a result, is critical to our growth. We focus on results. Our market leading technology supports rapid time-to-deployment, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months, achieving swift time to value. We strive for excellence in many ways, one example of which is through our product release and update cycles. Here, we seek to improve product design iteratively, based on user feedback, as we look to build ever-more intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces to shield users from the complexity associated with more traditional, legacy enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and procurement solutions. Our relentless commitment to the embodiment of our core values supports the creation of meaningful, measurable customer value within a short timeframe, resulting in a rapid return on investment for our customers.
We have developed a rich partner ecosystem of systems integrators, implementation partners, resellers, and technology partners. We work closely with several global systems integrators, including Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, and others that help us scale our business, extend our global reach, and drive increased market penetration. We expect the number of partner-led implementations and sales referrals to continue to increase over time.
We have achieved rapid growth in customer adoption, cumulative spend under management, and transactions conducted through our platform. Our cumulative spend under management is highlighted below:
As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our cumulative spend under management was $3,340 billion, $2,359 billion and $1,655 billion, respectively. Cumulative spend under management does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not generally charge our customers based on actual usage of our BSM platform. However, we believe that cumulative spend under management illustrates the adoption, scale, and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.
For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our total revenues were $725.3 million, $541.6 million and $389.7 million, respectively, and our net losses were $379.0 million, $180.1 million and $90.8 million, respectively, as we focused on growing our business.
The Coupa BSM Platform
Our BSM platform provides businesses with real-time visibility and control of spend and liquidity. The platform’s modern, user-centric interface enables businesses to drive adoption of the platform, to capture, analyze, and control their spend, and to achieve real, measurable value and savings, and directly improve their profitability:
•Adopt. Our platform applies a user-centric approach that shields users from complexity and provides a mobile-enabled intuitive customer experience, thus enabling widespread adoption of our platform by users across the entire organization, and across the customer’s supplier base.
•Capture. At the core of our platform is our transactional engine comprised of our procurement, invoicing, expense management, and payment management capabilities, which comprehensively help capture and manage spend within an organization. Because purchase orders, invoices, expense reports, and payments flow through our platform and the data is stored centrally in a clean and organized fashion, businesses are able to observe their spending activities in real-time.
•Analyze. Our spending analytics capabilities provide intuitive spend analysis dashboards and reports that deliver real-time analytical insights to help businesses identify problems and make better spending decisions. Real-time analytical and prescriptive insights are critical to helping identify savings opportunities and risks, isolating problem areas in the spending process, and providing recommendations to target improvement efforts. Our supply chain design and planning capabilities help businesses analyze options for optimizing their supply chains to optimize for profitability, cost, and risk reduction.
•Control. We help our customers control and streamline their spending activity, realize efficiencies that result in real savings, and reduce supplier and other third party risks. Our platform has extensive functionality that enables managers to prevent excessive spend, reduce spend through efficiencies and cost savings associated with strategic sourcing and contract compliance, and identify and manage risky suppliers across various layers of the supply base.
•Value. Within a short timeframe, we help our customers realize measurable value by taking advantage of pre-negotiated supplier discounts, achieving contract compliance, improving process efficiencies, and reducing redundant and wasteful spending, as well as enabling strategic sourcing via reverse auctions where suppliers bid down prices at which they are willing to sell their goods and services to businesses.
Our BSM Platform’s Capabilities
Our BSM platform includes the following capabilities:
Coupa’s Transactional Engine
The core of our platform is our transactional engine, which is comprised of the following solutions:
•Procure: Our procurement solution enables customers to strategically establish spend policies and approval rules to govern company spending. The application provides an intuitive, e-commerce-type shopping experience so that employees can easily and quickly find the goods and services they need to do their jobs. For example, employees searching for goods can see inventory-on-hand balances in the search results, which eliminates redundant spending. They also can access a marketplace of approved providers directly from the application. Our procurement solution streamlines purchase requisition and purchase order processes, allowing businesses to track and manage purchases in real-time, thus reducing time and cost. Upon approval of an employee request, purchase orders are automatically sent to suppliers for fulfillment and invoicing. Benchmark data allows customers to spot process inefficiencies, while ease of configuration enables businesses to effortlessly adjust business processes to meet continually changing requirements.
•Invoice: Customers may quickly configure invoice approval and matching rules so invoices can be routed without accounts payable team member effort and cost. Easy, no-cost means for suppliers to create electronic invoices that comply with government regulations allow businesses to eliminate paper and further reduce their invoice processing costs, all while reducing invoice payment fraud risk. Furthermore, our invoicing solution enables customers to improve cash management through the effective management of supplier invoices via embedded dashboards and work queues that prioritize invoices with early payment discount opportunities.
•Expense: Our travel and expense management solution enables customers to gain visibility and control of corporate travel and the other expenses incurred by employees. Innovative mobile capabilities such as GPS and geo-location make it easy for travelers to create expense reports on-the-go. Frugal meter capabilities automatically assess the appropriateness of employee charges based on the customer’s configured policies and thresholds. Seamless connectivity to Coupa Pay virtual cards and credit card providers directly feeds charges into our expense management solution for added ease of payment, visibility and reconciliation. Coupa also provides travel management capabilities, such as an online booking tool with embedded travel price assurance that helps companies capture savings from flight and hotel price decreases that happen after the booking has been placed.
•Pay: Coupa Pay represents a set of solutions that help customers consolidate and optimize their processes to manage working capital and make payments to suppliers and contractors, as well as to employees for travel and expense reimbursements. With Coupa Pay, customers can make payments using different methods, including domestic and international bank transfers, one-time-use virtual credit cards, digital checks, and digital wallets. Coupa's comprehensive approach to payments removes silos between Procurement, Accounts Payable, and Treasury, thus increasing process efficiency, reducing invoice volume through the use of secure virtual credit cards at the time of purchase order, and unlocking the opportunity to take advantage of early pay discounts. Customers are equipped with a single portal to manage all payments across multiple banks, and their suppliers get visibility into payment status. The process to create, approve, and release payments is automated to save time and avoid potential error and fraud. This process is secured with access controls and encrypted transmission and storage of payment-related information. With payments management as a core capability within our unified BSM platform, all types of payment transactions are automatically reconciled to supporting documentation for better visibility and control of business spend.
Supporting Solutions
Our platform offers the following supporting solutions that help companies further manage their spend, and associated back-office processes:
Strategic Sourcing. Our strategic sourcing solution enables customers to find the best suppliers for the goods or services they need to run their businesses. It also offers advanced capabilities for complex sourcing categories such as direct raw materials and logistics. Customers easily create sourcing events containing the specifics of their business needs and invite suppliers to participate. Suppliers are able to review and bid effortlessly and without any fees to participate. Collaboration capabilities enable employees to review bids and provide feedback that is automatically compiled and scored. For the sourcing of complex categories, Coupa applies advanced mathematical optimization techniques, allowing customers to analyze price and non-price elements to find the combination of suppliers and goods and services that meet the constraints they specify.
Contract Management. Our contracts solution enables customers to let their employees author new contracts within “guardrails” to manage risk while improving efficiency for their legal teams. Higher-risk contract terms can be escalated for legal review, while lower-risk choices can be pre-approved. Once negotiated, approved and signed, customers can operationalize contracts, making these contracts easily available for use by employees across the organization. Buying under the terms of negotiated contracts can increase savings through the use of pre-agreed rates and mitigate risk through contractual protections. Customers get visibility into how contracts affect spending with embedded dashboards at both the contract and summary level. Advanced contract analysis capabilities give customers visibility into contract terms and risk, while automatic alerts remind employees to review contracts prior to expiration or auto-renewal dates.
Contingent Workforce. Our contingent workforce solution enables customers to gain better visibility, control and optimization of services spend, as part of their holistic business spend management program. Customers can easily initiate requests for temporary work or advanced SOW-based projects as well as source and collect bids. Having better visibility to preferred suppliers helps customers optimize costs by selecting appropriate vendors with competitive rates. Onboarding and offboarding contingent workers is fast and secure, while tracking worker performance and ensuring compliance with company policies is simplified for both customers and contingent workers.
Supplier Risk Management. Our supplier risk management solution enables customers to collect the supplier information required to manage and pay suppliers and provides data about potential risks associated with a given supplier. Customers can also use this solution to help ensure compliance and mitigate third-party risk by extensively evaluating their supplier base against critical risk domains, including information security, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and GDPR compliance, while also staying informed on potential supplier risk by leveraging credit ratings and other searches of publicly available databases. Customers can track additional supplier attributes related to sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and other measures and then report on program performance against sustainability and diversity and inclusion goals. 
Supply Chain Design and Planning. Our supply chain design and planning solution leverages a foundation of internal and external data sources, in addition to artificial intelligence and advanced analytics, to generate a comprehensive digital model of the extended supply chain. Customers with global, complex physical supply chains use Coupa to continuously design their supply chains, performing scenario planning to analyze options and trade-offs that help build supply chain resiliency and agility. This includes an easy-to-use “no code” app building environment that enables customers to leverage Coupa’s deep domain-specific algorithm library to efficiently deploy purpose-built apps to support a range of supply chain use cases made available to decision makers across the enterprise. A tight linkage with Coupa’s sourcing capabilities allows customers to easily initiate sourcing events for any gaps identified during the supply chain design process. 
Treasury Management. Our treasury management solution enables organizations to optimize cash and liquidity by gaining better insights into future liquidity demands and linking cash management to purchasing and invoicing processes to improve forecasting across the entire enterprise. Organizations can connect to most banks worldwide using SWIFT, H2H or domestic communication standards for statement collection. Coupa provides organizations with visibility into their financial data across multiple subsidiaries, entities, currencies, and geographies, automating liquidity planning and enabling them to manage and record financial instruments. Organizations can consolidate subsidiary exposure and streamline intercompany transfers with centralized group-wide payments, cash pooling and intercompany account structures for all subsidiaries. Organizations can reduce risk and protect liquidity compliant workflows with exposure and hedge ratio tracking and by having all spend and payment data in one place enabled by real-time data and insights through analytics and reporting. Fraud prevention detects suspicious activities with a central vendor database and streamlines payment approval using validation status.
Spend Analysis. Our spend analysis solution provides managers a large set of built-in reports and dashboards that allow users to see spending activity, find bottlenecks in workflows, analyze granular data by commodity, supplier, location and cost center, and drill down into the spend transactions. Customers can also leverage Community.ai and our artificial intelligence capabilities to automate complex business spend data classification and identify potentially fraudulent transactions within our system. We have created more than one hundred out-of-the-box reports covering some of the most important business metrics, such as unified spend for purchase orders, invoices or expense reports, spend trends over time, and spend by commodity, supplier and contract. Users can also create new metrics, reports and dashboards with our intuitive user interface, as well as include external data like corporate and travel expenses or integrate with third-party systems, to get a holistic view of their spend patterns.
Coupa Open Business Network
Our Coupa Open Business Network instantly connects business customers and suppliers, providing businesses with a platform that is accessible to suppliers of all sizes—even those typically ignored by fee-based closed networks—to drive success. Suppliers have a variety of options to connect with businesses including:
•Coupa Supplier Portal. This portal is a tool for suppliers to easily do business with our customers. The Supplier Portal lets suppliers manage content and settings on a customer-by-customer basis, including managing company information, setting up purchase order transmission preferences, creating and managing online catalogs, managing procurement orders and invoices across multiple customers and gaining visibility into the status of invoices.
•Coupa Supplier Actionable Notifications. These notifications enable suppliers to receive HTML purchaser orders and convert these purchase orders into invoices right from the procurement order e-mail, which represents the easiest way to submit electronic invoices through our platform.
•Direct Connection via cXML and EDI. Our platform supports various communication formats such as cXML or EDI for suppliers that want to automate their invoicing through a tighter integration with our platform.
•Direct E-mail. Suppliers can choose to send PDF invoices simply through e-mail. Our platform supports automatic reading of PDF invoices, requiring no human intervention.
By using our Coupa Open Business Network, companies can improve compliance with government regulations, increase profitability, and reduce costs by driving electronic transactions away from paper-based transactions. Our Coupa Open Business Network user interface is easy to navigate and requires little to no training for suppliers. Businesses are able to interact with millions of suppliers already using our Coupa Supplier Portal, assess the suppliers' suitability for their business, quickly onboard new suppliers, integrate directly or simply use our smart e-mail tools. Businesses can also use the Coupa Open Business Network to layer on top of their existing technology, including third-party systems such as Oracle iProcurement, SAP SRM, material resource planning (“MRP”) solutions, and others. Suppliers of all sizes benefit, as they are able to join the networked economy without changing their technology or spending money on transaction fees.
Coupa Advantage and Coupa Source Together
Our Coupa Advantage program offers customers the opportunity to leverage pre-negotiated discounts from select suppliers in several business categories such as office supplies, branded promotional products, background checks, employee perquisites and more. The program leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers to offer potential savings opportunities. Similarly, the Coupa Source Together program offers customers the ability to pool spend for bespoke sourcing events, driving better outcomes across price, quality, and terms. 
Coupa Community Connections
Our Community Connections capabilities connect industry practitioners across companies to foster best practice knowledge sharing and mutually beneficial relationships in the BSM space. These capabilities are embedded throughout our platform and include, for example: informative discussion forums surfaced in-context to users as they make spend decisions within Coupa; the ability to find and message BSM professionals at other organizations; and a spend matchmaking capability that automatically recommends connections with community experts to provide input or work together on a sourcing event, among others. These capabilities, combined with the scale of Coupa’s customer base and the volume of educational content and programming produced on Coupa for the entire BSM community, produce a network effect that enables us to provide more value to our customers.
Coupa Community Insights
Our Community Insights capabilities, which extend across our BSM platform, provides information to Coupa customers by applying artificial intelligence-powered analysis to the structured, normalized data collected from the comprehensive set of business spend transactions that have occurred on the Coupa platform. This innovative analysis provides Coupa customers with prescriptive recommendations to optimize their spend decisions, improve operational efficiency, and reduce risk based on best practices from the Coupa community. Participating customers are able to contribute to and benefit from Community Insights, with use cases spanning various areas of spend management, including: Supplier Insights and Supplier Risk Management which help companies find and evaluate new and existing suppliers to reduce risk levels; operational insights which help businesses measure their own performance on key operational metrics against other Coupa customers and follow best practices to drive efficiency and savings, Commodity and Procurable Insights which help companies identify spend consolidation and savings opportunities, and Spend Guard, which leverages artificial intelligence on behavior patterns to automatically surface potential errors and fraud across all business spend.

We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs, including such programs with our strategic relationships. For example, we have joint marketing programs and sponsorship agreements with KPMG, Deloitte, and Accenture.
Our principal marketing programs include:
•our annual Coupa Inspire conferences which are held in multiple jurisdictions and over multiple days to connect customers, disseminate best practices, and reinforce our brand among existing and new customers.

Recent Acquisitions
In February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pana Industries, Inc. (“Pana”), a corporate travel booking solution company that puts an emphasis on the traveler experience. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid aggregate cash of approximately $48.5 million, and issued 23,822 shares of our common stock.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to extend our sales capabilities and coverage, to broaden and complement our application offerings, and to provide a broad array of services that lie outside of our primary areas of focus.
Our partnerships increase our ability to grow and scale quickly and efficiently and allow us to maintain greater focus on executing against our strategy.
•Referral Partners. Our referral partners provide global, national and regional expertise in business spend management, procurement and expense management. They help organizations through operational transformation by leveraging process, best practices and new technology. These partners may refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to them. In return, we typically pay these partners a percentage of the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer.
•Implementation Partners. In order to offer the full breadth of implementation services, change management, and strategic consulting services to our customers, we work with leading global systems integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte and KPMG, as well as boutique and regional consulting firms. Our strategy is to enable the majority of our projects to be led by implementation partners with additional specialized support from us. Our implementation partners are highly skilled and trained by our team. When working with implementation partners, we are typically in a “co-sell” arrangement where we will sell our subscription directly to the customer and our partner will sell its implementation services directly to the customer.
•Reseller Partners. Our reseller partners enhance our customer impact and extend our global presence with integrated technologies, applications, business process outsourcing (BPO) services and region-specific offerings. All of our reseller partners have been trained to demonstrate and promote our applications suites.
•Financial Services Company Partners. Our financial services company partners provide deep expertise as well as transactional solutions for executing payments. Partners include leading card issuers American Express, Bank of America, Barclaycard, Citibank, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, and money-movement provider Transfermate, as well as others. These partner-provided solutions let customers use their existing bank relationships to move money globally.
•Technology Partners. Our technology partners provide market-leading technology, complementary products and infrastructure-related services that power and extend our suite of cloud-based business spend management applications. Our technology partners span a wide range of solutions providers including MuleSoft, Dell, Ecovadis, and DocuSign that enhance the capabilities of our platform by facilitating integrations that can deliver a higher level of value to customers. As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to extend our sales capabilities and coverage, to broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that lie outside of our primary areas of focus. Many of these partners are featured in the Coupa App Marketplace.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
The technologies used to build our platform and solution capabilities are cloud-native and designed to scale to millions of users. We utilize a modern technology stack to take advantage of advancements in web design, open-source technologies, scalability and security. We have implemented industry-standard security practices to help us protect our customers’ critical information.
We have partnered with leading hosting and infrastructure companies to provide the hardware and infrastructure to support our BSM platform. With these partnerships, we are able to easily scale the service during peak load periods, allowing us to continuously add users and customers without significant downtime or lead-time to procure new capacity. We also have the ability to offer our solutions globally across various different physical locations, such as the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Research and Development
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our applications. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing applications.
Competition
We believe the overall market for BSM software is highly competitive, marked by rapid consolidation, fragmented, and rapidly evolving due to technological innovations. We have been recognized, however, as a technology and market leader.
Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
•Large enterprise software vendors such as Oracle Corporation, SAP AG and Workday that predominantly focus on database and ERP software solutions;
•Niche software vendors that either address only a portion of the capabilities we provide or predominantly focus on narrow industry verticals.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•focus on customer success;
•ability to deliver measurable value and savings;
•ability to offer a comprehensive BSM platform;
•ease of use;
•widespread adoption by users;
•time to deployment;
•cloud-based architecture;
•total cost of ownership;
•configurability and agility;
•rich reporting capabilities;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•independence;
•adoption by suppliers;
•ability to deliver prescriptive insights based on aggregated, anonymized data;
•ability to leverage extensive data to detect supplier and employee risk; and
•community-driven collaboration and savings opportunities.
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not compare favorably with respect to some or all of the factors above.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.
We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We also actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective protection of our technology and intellectual property rights may not be available to us in every country in which our software or services are available.
We and others in our industry have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Moreover, many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications, and have asserted claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies, have asserted patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights within the industry. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Government Regulations
Various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, applicable to us have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our business, our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position could be negatively impacted. Refer to Item 1A. titled “Risk Factors” for further information, including the risks described under the caption “Government, Regulatory and Tax-Related Risks.”
Our Customers
As of January 31, 2022, our customers are doing business in more than 70 countries and our products are offered in more than 30 languages. We generally define a customer as a separate and distinct entity (such as a company or an educational or government institution), a distinct business unit of a large corporation or a partner organization, in each case that have an active contract with us to access our services. Our customers include leading businesses in a diverse set of industries, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals, retail, financial services, manufacturing, and technology.
Human Capital
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee well-being. As of January 31, 2022, we had 3,076 full-time employees globally, of which 1,590 work in the U.S. and 1,486 work in our international locations. Coupa was named on Fortune's “Best Workplaces in Technology” for 2021, Fortune's “100 Best Medium Workplaces” for 2021 and 2020.
Culture and Values
Coupa’s culture plays a critical role in guiding how we identify, develop and deploy our human capital resources. We have built our culture around three principles:
•Ensure customer success
•Focus on results
•Strive for excellence
We believe these principles set clear expectations for those who join our community; help ensure our employees are working towards the same goals; and guide how we treat one another, our customers, and the communities we serve.
We conduct an annual employee survey to better understand and improve the employee experience. Part of the survey seeks to measure the extent to which these three principles have been adopted by our workforce. In 2021, 71% of our global employees participated in our annual survey, 93% of our employees believe the organization works hard to ensure customer success, 94% believe there is a strong focus on results, and 93% are encouraged to strive for excellence day to day. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that diversity and inclusion must be embedded into the way that we do business because we know that companies thrive when they are powered by a diversity of people and culture, while people thrive in a culture that promotes dignity, equity, and respect. We work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through attraction, education, and advocacy. Our aim is to ensure that our employees feel a strong sense of belonging and are comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work every day, and our employee resource groups help support that. These groups consist of volunteer Coupa employees who provide personal and professional support to our diverse communities, beyond the scope of their core job duties. Our employee resource groups include the following:
Coupa Empower. Empower's mission is to break down barriers to women’s success by creating a community of individuals and organizations working together to unleash the impact of women in business. The three pillars of Empower are as follows:
•Discover. Focused on the individual, Discover provides development tools for career growth to build a gender balanced pool of leaders who can create and sustain a positive culture.
•Connect. Focused on driving company initiatives, Connect partners with other organizations to expand beyond its existing internal network to develop bonds and impact change across our shared ecosystem of women's leadership.
•Impact. Focused on the community we live in and the world around us, Impact provides opportunities to work with socially responsible programs and organizations that benefit the global community.
Coupa Illuminate. Illuminate’s purpose is to support our LGBTQ+ community by inspiring connection, inclusiveness, and diversity. We respect gender fluidity and non-traditional family units, advocate for equality and fairness, and foster opportunities for stewardship and growth in our local communities.
Coupa Engage. Engage stands to uplift and expand the underrepresented community at Coupa. This group provides a personal and professional platform to support colleagues of color to network and form closer relationships with allies within the company. This group sets its principles on three major pillars: leadership development, inclusion and equity, and community enrichment.
Coupa Green: Launched in 2021, this employee led group is focused on having a positive impact on our environment both in the workplace and at home through educating employees on environmental issues and encouraging action.  
Growth and Development
We foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their career progression and professional development. Our Coupa University platform provides our employees with access to a wide range of training and development programs, as well as virtual learning resources on-demand to help them excel in their careers. Employees may also participate in our student loan repayment assistance program to help pay off their student loans faster.
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that typically include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards that vest subject to continued service. We also offer an employee stock purchase plan which allows our employees to contribute a portion of their wages towards the purchase of our stock at a discount. During the year ended January 31, 2022, our overall ESPP participation rate was approximately 74% which remains strong relative to the global benchmark. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term incentives provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan.
Health, Safety and Wellness
We believe we maintain a high-quality work environment, and we strive to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We endeavor to comply with applicable local laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program, and maintaining robust emergency and disaster recovery plans. We also offer our employees with a wide range of virtual on-demand fitness programs to promote regular physical fitness. 
COVID-19 Response
The spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices. Focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families, at the beginning of the pandemic, we closed our offices globally and required our employees to work remotely. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we have implemented a phased-in approach in re-opening certain of our offices and invited our employees to return to work on a voluntary basis if they wished to do so. Our employees' health and safety is our top priority, and we will continue to monitor local restrictions across the world, the administration of vaccines, and the number of new cases. Any incidents of actual or perceived transmission may require us to temporarily close any impacted office. Additionally, due to concerns over risks related to travel and large gatherings, for the last two fiscal years we have replaced our in-person, annual Inspire conferences and other in-person marketing events with other web-based virtual events. As the pandemic continues, the health and well-being of our workforce remains our top priority while we work to ensure the productivity and enablement of our workforce as they continue to work from home.
Corporate Social Responsibility: “Coupa Cares”
A core part of our corporate social responsibility efforts is engaging employees through various initiatives. This includes Coupa Cares, our social impact program that is focused on three key areas:
•Serve: We support employees in dedicating their time and skills for social and environmental causes. This includes mobilizing employees to volunteer and utilize 16 hours of annual “Volunteer Time Off” benefits; organizing Coupa’s “Global Volunteer Day”; and organizing in-person and virtual volunteer events.
•Give: We invest in our local communities. This includes providing funding to charitable organizations, administering an employee donation matching and volunteer rewards program with a $250 annual match, and awarding educational scholarships.
•Lead: We inspire our employees and broader Coupa Community to take action and amplify our collective impact around the world by collaborating with our employee resource groups and partnering with external organizations. 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Impact
Coupa is committed to advancing our sustainable business practices and strives to drive environmental and social impact for our customers and in our communities. We continue to work on our ESG program through a cross-functional working group that helps drive our strategic initiatives. We understand the importance of transparency and in 2021 we published our first annual ESG report, in which we outlined our priorities and communicated the details of our initiatives and progress.
