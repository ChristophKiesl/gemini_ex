Unitil had an investment in Net Utility Plant of $1,193.2 million at December 31, 2020. Unitil’s total operating revenue was $418.6 million in 2020. Unitil’s operating revenue is substantially derived from regulated natural gas and electric distribution utility operations. A fifth utility subsidiary, Unitil Power, formerly functioned as the full requirements wholesale power supply provider for Unitil Energy, but 
 
3 

  currently has limited business and operating activities. In connection with the implementation of electric industry restructuring in New Hampshire, Unitil Power ceased being the wholesale supplier for Unitil Energy in 2003 and divested substantially all of its long-term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity associated with those contracts. 
 Unitil has three other wholly-owned non-utility subsidiaries: Unitil Service, Unitil Realty, and Unitil Resources. Unitil Service provides, at cost, a variety of administrative and professional services, including regulatory, financial, accounting, human resources, engineering, operations, technology and energy supply management services on a centralized basis to its affiliated Unitil companies. Unitil Realty owns and manages the Company’s corporate office in Hampton, New Hampshire. Unitil Resources is the Company’s wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary. Usource, Inc. and Usource L.L.C. (collectively, Usource), which the Company divested in the first quarter of 2019, were indirect subsidiaries that were wholly-owned by Unitil Resources. Usource provided energy brokering and advisory services to large commercial and industrial customers in the northeastern United States. See additional discussion of the divestiture of Usource in “Divestiture of Non-Regulated Business Subsidiary” in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For segment information relating to each segment’s revenue, earnings and assets, see Note 3 (Segment Information) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this report. All of the Company’s revenues are attributable to customers in the United States of America and all its long-lived assets are located in the United States of America. 
 OPERATIONS 
 Natural Gas Operations 
 Unitil’s natural gas operations include gas distribution utility operations and interstate gas transmission pipeline operations. Revenue from Unitil’s gas operations was $191.4 million in 2020, which represents about 46% of Unitil’s total operating revenue. The Company’s GAAP Gas Gross Margin was $92.8 million in 2020. The Company’s Gas Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) was $122.6 million in 2020, or 57% of Unitil’s total Adjusted Gross Margin. See “Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures for the periods presented. 
 Natural Gas Distribution Utility Operations 
 Unitil’s natural gas distribution operations are conducted through two of the Company’s operating utilities, Northern Utilities and Fitchburg. The primary business of Unitil’s natural gas utility operations is the local distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territories in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. Northern Utilities’ C&I customers and Fitchburg’s residential and C&I customers are entitled to purchase their natural gas supply from third-party competitive suppliers, while Northern Utilities or Fitchburg remains their gas distribution company. Both Northern Utilities and Fitchburg supply gas to those customers who do not obtain their supply from third-party competitive suppliers, with the approved costs associated with this gas supply recovered on a pass-through basis through regulated reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted. 
 Natural gas is distributed by Northern Utilities to 69,404 customers in 47 New Hampshire and southern Maine communities, from Plaistow, New Hampshire in the south to the city of Portland, Maine and then extending to Lewiston-Auburn, Maine to the north. Northern Utilities has a diversified customer base both in Maine and New Hampshire. Commercial businesses include healthcare, education, government and retail. Northern Utilities’ industrial base includes manufacturers in the auto, housing, rubber, printing, textile, pharmaceutical, electronics, wire and food production industries as well as a military installation. Northern Utilities’ 2020 gas operating revenue was $150.9 million, of which approximately 38% was derived from residential firm sales and 62% from C&I firm sales. 
 Natural gas is distributed by Fitchburg to 16,170 customers in the communities of Fitchburg, Lunenburg, Townsend, Ashby, Gardner and Westminster, all located in Massachusetts. Fitchburg’s 
 
4 

  industrial customers include paper manufacturing and paper products companies, rubber and plastics manufacturers, chemical products companies and printing, publishing and associated industries. Fitchburg’s 2020 gas operating revenue was $34.0 million, of which approximately 59% was derived from residential firm sales and 41% from C&I firm sales. 
 Gas Transmission Pipeline Operations 
 Granite State is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company, operating 86 miles of underground gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. Granite State provides Northern Utilities with interconnection to major natural gas pipelines and access to domestic natural gas supplies in the south and Canadian natural gas supplies in the north. Granite State had operating revenue of $6.5 million in 2020. Granite State derives its revenues principally from the transportation services provided to Northern Utilities and to third-party suppliers. 
Electric Distribution Utility Operations 
   Unitil’s electric distribution operations are conducted through two of the Company’s utilities, Unitil Energy, and Fitchburg. Revenue from Unitil’s electric utility operations was $227.2 million in 2020, which represents about 54% of Unitil’s total operating revenue. The Company’s GAAP Electric Gross Margin was $69.1 million in 2020. The Company’s Electric Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) was $92.9 million in 2020, or 43% of Unitil’s total Adjusted Gross Margin. See “Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures for the periods presented. 
 The primary business of Unitil’s electric utility operations is the local distribution of electricity to customers in its service territory in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. All of Unitil Energy’s and Fitchburg’s electric customers are entitled to choose to purchase their supply of electricity from third-party competitive suppliers, while Unitil Energy and Fitchburg remain their electric distribution company. Both Unitil Energy and Fitchburg supply electricity to those customers who do not obtain their supply from third-party competitive suppliers, with the approved costs associated with electricity supply being recovered on a pass-through basis through regulated reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted. 
 Unitil Energy distributes electricity to 77,204 customers in New Hampshire in the capital city of Concord as well as parts of 12 surrounding towns, and all or part of 18 towns in the southeastern and seacoast regions of New Hampshire, including the towns of Hampton, Exeter, Atkinson and Plaistow. Unitil Energy’s service territory consists of approximately 408 square miles. Unitil Energy’s service territory encompasses retail and recreation centers for the central and southeastern parts of the state and includes the Hampton Beach recreational area. These areas serve diversified commercial and industrial businesses, including manufacturing firms engaged in the production of electronic components, wire and plastics, healthcare and education. Unitil Energy’s 2020 electric operating revenue was $159.4 million, of which approximately 58% was derived from residential sales and 42% from C&I sales. 
 Fitchburg is engaged in the distribution of both electricity and natural gas in the greater Fitchburg area of north central Massachusetts. Fitchburg’s service territory encompasses approximately 170 square miles. Electricity is distributed by Fitchburg to 29,873 customers in the communities of Fitchburg, Ashby, Townsend and Lunenburg. Fitchburg’s industrial customers include paper manufacturing and paper products companies, rubber and plastics manufacturers, chemical products companies, printing, publishing and associated industries, and educational institutions. Fitchburg’s 2020 electric operating revenue was $67.8 million, of which approximately 61% was derived from residential sales and 39% from C&I sales.

Seasonality 
 The Company’s results of operations are expected to reflect the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Annual gas revenues are substantially realized during the colder weather seasons of the year as a result of higher sales of natural gas used for heating related purposes. Accordingly, the results of operations 
 
5 

  are historically most favorable in the first and fourth quarters. Fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions may have a significant effect on the result of operations. Sales of electricity are generally less sensitive to weather than natural gas sales, but may also be affected by the weather conditions and the temperature in both the winter and summer seasons. 
 Unitil Energy, Fitchburg and Northern Utilities are not dependent on a single customer or a few customers for their electric and natural gas sales. 
 Non-Regulated and Other Non-Utility Operations 
 Unitil’s non-regulated operations were conducted through Usource, a subsidiary of Unitil Resources. The Company divested Usource in the first quarter of 2019. Usource provided energy brokering and advisory services to large commercial and industrial customers in the northeastern United States. See additional discussion of the divestiture of Usource in “Divestiture of Non-Regulated Business Subsidiary” in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The results of Unitil’s other non-utility subsidiaries, Unitil Service and Unitil Realty, and the holding company, are included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations. The results of these non-utility operations are principally derived from income earned on short-term investments and real property owned for Unitil’s and its subsidiaries’ use and are reported, after intercompany eliminations, in Other segment income. For segment information, see Note 3 (Segment Information) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this report. 
RATES AND REGULATION 
 Regulation 
 Unitil is subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities. Unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the FERC under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 with regard to certain bookkeeping, accounting and reporting requirements. Unitil’s utility operations related to wholesale and interstate energy business activities also are regulated by the FERC. Unitil’s distribution utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions, with regard to their rates, issuance of securities and other accounting and operational matters: Unitil Energy is subject to regulation by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC); Fitchburg is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU); and Northern Utilities is regulated by the NHPUC and Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC). Granite State, Unitil’s interstate natural gas transmission pipeline, is subject to regulation by the FERC with regard to its rates and operations. Because Unitil’s primary operations are subject to rate regulation, the regulatory treatment of various matters could significantly affect the Company’s operations and financial position. 
 Unitil’s distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or natural gas to all customers in their service territory, at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Unitil’s distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a historical test year, and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets. In addition, the Company’s distribution utilities and its natural gas transmission pipeline company may recover certain base rate costs, including capital project spending and enhanced reliability and vegetation management programs, through annual step adjustments and cost tracking rate mechanisms. 
 Fitchburg is subject to revenue decoupling. Revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utility’s distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales. The difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted revenue decoupling amounts is recognized as an increase or a decrease in the current portion of Accrued Revenue which forms the basis for resetting rates for future cash recoveries from, or credits to, customers. These revenue decoupling targets may be adjusted as a result of rate cases and other authorized adjustments that the Company files with the MDPU. The Company estimates that revenue decoupling applies to approximately 27% and 11% of Unitil’s total annual electric and natural gas sales volumes, respectively. 
 Also see Note 7 (Energy Supply) and Note 8 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on rates and regulation.
