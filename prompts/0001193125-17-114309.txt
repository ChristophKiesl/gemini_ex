The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations on pages 17 through 27 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Description of Business 
 Product Overview 
 AstroNova leverages its expertise in data visualization technologies to design, manufacture and market specialty printing systems, test and measurement systems and related services for select growing markets on a global basis. The business consists of two segments, Product Identification, which includes specialty printing systems sold under the brand name QuickLabel® and Test & Measurement (T&M), which includes test and measurement systems sold under the AstroNova brand name. Refer to Note 13, Nature of Operations, Segment Reporting and Geographical Information, in our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for financial information regarding the Companys segments. 
 Products sold under the QuickLabel brand are used in industrial and commercial product packaging, branding and labeling applications to digitally print custom labels and corresponding visual content on demand. Products sold under the AstroNova brand acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data streams and sensors. The recorded data is processed and analyzed and then stored and presented in various visual output formats. In the aerospace market, the Company has a long history of using its data visualization technologies to provide high-resolution airborne printers. 
 Product Identification 
 QuickLabel brand products include tabletop and work cell-ready digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems as well as a full line of consumables including labels, tags, inks, toner and thermal transfer ribbons. In addition, the Product Identification segment sells special software used to design labels and print them on an automated basis and also provides training and support on a worldwide basis via highly trained service technicians. 
 Through the QuickLabel line, our Product Identification segment offers a broad range of entry-level, mid-range, and high-performance digital label printers, providing customers a continuous path to upgrade to new labeling solutions designed, manufactured and sold by the Company. Product Identification segment products are primarily sold to manufacturers, processors, and retailers who label products on a short-run basis. QuickLabels customers benefit from the efficiency, flexibility and cost-savings of digitally printing their own labels on-site and on-demand. Industry segments that commonly benefit from short-run label printing include chemicals, cosmetics, food and beverage, medical products, and pharmaceuticals, among many others. 
 Current QuickLabel models include the Kiaro! family of high-speed inkjet color label printers, the QL-111 industrial color label printer and the QL-800 wide format color label printer, as well as a family of barcode printers. 
 T&M 
 Products sold under the AstroNova T&M brand acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data streams and sensors. The recorded data is processed and analyzed and then stored and presented in various visual output formats. The Company supplies a range of products and services that include hardware, software and consumables to customers who are in a variety of industries. 
 Our T&M products include the Daxus® portable data acquisition system, TMX® high-speed data acquisition system, DDX100 SmartCorder® portable data acquisition system, EVX multi-channel chart recording system, ToughWriter®, Miltope-brand and RITEC-brand airborne printers and ToughSwitch® ruggedized Ethernet switches.

AstroNova airborne printers are used in the flight deck and in the cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft, including navigation maps, arrival and departure procedures, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and various air traffic control data. ToughSwitch Ethernet switches are used in military aircraft and military vehicles to connect multiple computers or Ethernet devices. The airborne printers and Ethernet switches are ruggedized to comply with rigorous military and commercial flightworthiness standards for operation under extreme environmental conditions. The Company is currently furnishing ToughWriter airborne printers for numerous aircraft made by Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, Bombardier, Lockheed, Gulfstream and others. 
 The Companys family of portable data recorders is used in research and development (R&D) and maintenance applications in aerospace and defense, energy discovery and production operations, rapid rail, automotive, and a variety of other transportation and industrial applications. The TMX data acquisition system is designed for data capture of long-term testing where the ability to monitor high channel counts and view a wide variety of input signals, including time-stamped and synchronized video capture data and audio notation is important. The Daxus and DDX 100 SmartCorder are both powerful instruments designed for portability and ease of use in facilities maintenance applications, field work, test cells and transportation. Daxus and DDX100 SmartCorder can be linked to increase channel count and can also be networked for distributed data collection. 
 Technology 
 Our core technologies are data visualization technologies that relate to (1) acquiring data, (2) conditioning the data, (3) displaying the data on hard copy, monitor or electronic storage media, and (4) analyzing the data. 
Patents and Copyrights 
 We hold a number of product patents in the United States and in foreign countries. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our technology and brand name. While we consider our intellectual property to be important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on the Companys business taken as a whole. 
Manufacturing and Supplies 
 We manufacture many of the products that we design and sell. Raw materials and supplies are typically available from a wide variety of sources. We manufacture most of the sub-assemblies and parts in-house including printed circuit board assemblies, harnesses, machined parts, and general final assembly. Many parts are standard electronic items available from multiple sources. Other parts are designed by us and manufactured by outside vendors. There are a few parts that are sole source, but these parts could be sourced elsewhere with appropriate changes in the design of our product. 
Product Development 
 We maintain an active program of product research and development. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent $6.3 million, $6.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, on Company-sponsored product development. We are committed to continuous product development as essential to our organic growth and expect to continue our focus on research and development efforts in fiscal 2018 and beyond. 
Marketing and Competition 
 The Company competes worldwide in multiple markets. In the specialty printing field, we believe we are a market leader in tabletop color label printing technology and in aerospace printers. In the data acquisition area, we believe that we are one of the leaders in portable high speed data acquisition systems. 
 
5 
 
We retain a leadership position by virtue of proprietary technology, product reputation, delivery, technical assistance, and service to customers. The number of competitors varies by product line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our product lines, but include technology, quality, service and support, distribution network, and breadth of product and service offerings. 
 Our products are sold by direct field salespersons as well as independent dealers and representatives. In the United States, the Company has factory-trained direct field salespeople located in major cities from coast to coast specializing in either Product Identification or AstroNova T&M products. Additionally, we have direct field sales or service centers in Canada, China, France, Germany, Mexico, Southeast Asia and the United Kingdom staffed by our own employees, some of whom are third party contractors. In the rest of the world, we utilize approximately 90 independent dealers and representatives selling and marketing our products in 57 countries. 
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in either of the last three fiscal years. 
 International Sales 
 In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue from customers in various geographic areas outside the United States, primarily in Canada and Western Europe, amounted to $28.6 million, $26.4 million and $26.8 million, respectively. Refer to Note 13, Nature of Operations, Segment Reporting and Geographical Information, in our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further financial information by geographic areas. 
Order Backlog 
 Our backlog varies regularly. It consists of a blend of orders for end-user customers as well as original equipment manufacturer customers. Manufacturing is geared to forecasted demands and applies a rapid turn cycle to meet customer expectations. Accordingly, the amount of order backlog may not indicate future sales trends. Backlog at January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $17.6 million, $18.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively. 
Employees 
 As of January 31, 2017, we employed 312 team members. We are generally able to satisfy our employment requirements. No employees are represented by a union. We believe that employee relations are good. 
Other Information 
 The Companys business is not seasonal in nature. However, our revenue is impacted by the size of certain individual transactions, which can cause fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter. 
Available Information 
 We make available on our website (www.astronovainc.com) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are also accessible on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating AstroNova, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of 
 
6 
 
 the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact our business operations. 
 AstroNovas operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. 
 Any decline in our customers markets or in their general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. For example, although we have continued to experience measured progress, as sales have increased steadily from prior years, we are still affected by the continued global economic uncertainty. Some of our customers may be reluctant to make capital equipment purchases or may defer certain of these purchases to future quarters. Some of our customers may also limit consumable product purchases to quantities necessary to satisfy immediate needs with no provisions to stock supplies for future use. Also, if our customers markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and could limit our ability to continue to remain profitable. 
 AstroNovas future revenue growth depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance of these new products and services. 
 The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and accelerating product introduction cycles. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. The success of our new products will also depend on our ability to differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings, price our products competitively, anticipate our competitors development of new products, and maintain high levels of product quality and reliability. AstroNova spends a significant amount of time and effort related to the development of our airborne and color printer products as well as our Test and Measurement data recorder products. Failure to further develop any of our new products and their related markets as anticipated could adversely affect our future revenue growth and operating results. 
 As we introduce new or enhanced products, we must also successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands. The introduction of new or enhanced products may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing existing products in anticipation of the new products. Additionally, when we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand, manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new products. Any customer uncertainty regarding the timeline for rolling out new products or AstroNovas plans for future support of existing products may cause customers to delay purchase decisions or purchase competing products which would adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 AstroNova faces significant competition, and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We operate in an environment of significant competition, driven by rapid technological advances, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the demands of customers to become more efficient. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms. We compete on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully in the markets we 
 
7 
 
 currently serve and to expand into additional market segments. Additionally, current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products. To remain competitive, we must develop new products, services and applications and periodically enhance our existing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. 
 AstroNova is dependent upon contract manufacturers for some of our products. If these manufacturers do not meet our requirements, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. 
 We subcontract the manufacturing and assembly of certain of our products to independent third parties at facilities located in various countries. Relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks, including: 
 

 | Limited control over the manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Potential absence of adequate production capacity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Potential delays in production lead times;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | Unavailability of certain process technologies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | Reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If one of our significant subcontractors becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes or fails to meet our quality standards, we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors or we will have to take over the manufacturing ourselves. Additional qualified subcontractors may not be available, or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis. Any interruption in the supply or increase in the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors or failure of a subcontractor to meet quality standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 For certain components, assembled products and consumables, AstroNova is dependent upon single or limited source suppliers. If these suppliers do not meet demand, either in volume or quality, then we could be materially harmed. 
 Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we purchase certain components, assembled products and consumables used in the manufacture of our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. If the supply of a key component, assembled products or certain consumables were to be delayed or curtailed or, in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or assembled products, our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations and financial position could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Additionally, if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components, assembled products or consumables in required volumes, we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components. Alternative sources may not be available, or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis. Any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components, assembled products and consumables provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Any future action by the U.S. Congress lowering the federal corporate income tax rate, and/or limiting deductions and credits, and/or eliminating the federal corporate alternative minimum tax could result in the reduction of our deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge against earnings. 
 The net deferred tax asset reported on our balance sheet represents the net amount of income taxes expected to be received upon the reversal of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities as measured 
 
8 
 
 by enacted tax laws, and their bases as reported in the financial statements. As of January 31, 2017, the Companys net deferred tax asset was computed using the federal statutory rate of 34%. 
 The President of the United States and members of Congress have announced plans to lower the federal corporate income tax rate from its current level of 35% and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. If these plans ultimately result in the enactment of new laws lowering the corporate income tax rate and/or eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, our net deferred tax asset would be re-measured resulting in a reduction of the deferred tax asset in the period of the law change and a corresponding charge against earnings. 
 The decision by British voters to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations. 
 The June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (Brexit) adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. As the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union, volatility in exchange rates and in U.K. interest rates may continue. In the near term, a weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars; a weaker British pound compared to other currencies increases the cost of goods imported into our U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of our U.K. operations; and a higher U.K. interest rate may have a dampening effect on the U.K. economy. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. 
 AstroNova has significant inventories on hand. 
 We maintain a significant amount of inventory. Although we have provided an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, could have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Compliance with rules governing conflict minerals could adversely affect the availability of certain product components and our costs and results of operations could be materially harmed. 
 SEC rules require disclosures regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have determined that we use gold, tin and tantalum, each of which are considered conflict minerals under the SEC rules, as they occur in electronic components supplied to us in the manufacture of our products. Because of this finding, we are required to conduct inquiries designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals contained in our products originated or may have originated in the conflict region or come from recycled or scrap sources. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including performing due diligence in regards to the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation or other changes to products, processes or services of supplies that may be necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. As we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect AstroNovas results of operations and financial position. 
 Because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Revenue from international operations, which includes both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the U.S., accounted for approximately 30% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2017, and we anticipate 
 
9 
 
 that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we have employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 
 

 | Interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Customer and vendor financial stability;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | Changes in a specific countrys or regions environment including political, economic, monetary, regulatory or other conditions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Difficulty in managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining adequate staffing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Differing labor regulations;
--+-----------------------------


 | Differing protection of intellectual property;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 AstroNovas profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and to control our cost structure. 
 Our success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services which provides a reasonable return to our shareholders. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our products and services may decline from previous levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset the effect of currency devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are continually reviewing our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including but not limited to downsizing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. From time to time we also engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to maintain process and systems changes resulting from cost reduction and prior restructuring actions, our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. 
 AstroNova could incur liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. 
 AstroNova has incurred and could incur additional liabilities as a result of installed product failures due to design or manufacturing defects. Our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers. These defects could result in among other things, a delay in recognition of sales, loss of sales, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation. We could be subject to material claims by customers, and may incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects. 
 In addition, through our acquisitions, we have assumed, and may in the future assume, liabilities related to products previously developed by an acquired company that have not been subjected to the same level of product development, testing and quality control processes used by us, and may have known or undetected errors. 
 
10 
 
 Some types of errors may not be detected until the product is installed in a user environment. This may cause AstroNova to incur significant warranty and repair or re-engineering costs, may divert the attention of engineering personnel from product development efforts, and may cause significant customer relations problems such as reputational problems with customers resulting in increased costs and lower profitability. 
 AstroNova could experience disruptions in, or breach in security of our information technology system or fail to implement new systems or software successfully which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We employ information technology systems to support our business. Any security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, compromise our information and that of our customers and suppliers, and expose us to liability which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We also collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches and our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, catastrophic events or other unforeseen events. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Companys brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 AstroNova is subject to laws and regulations; failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. In addition, we must comply with regulations restricting our ability to include lead and certain other substances in our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted. 
 Certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations, and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business. 
 In certain industries and for certain products, such as those used in aircraft, we must obtain certifications for our products by regulators or standards organizations. If we fail to obtain required certifications for our products, or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that the Company or any of its subsidiaries has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance 
 
11 
 
 with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by those of our employees or agents who violate our policies. 
 Certain of our operations and products are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may result in substantial compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, including those that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, establish standards for the use, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, and govern the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have used and continue to use various substances in our products and manufacturing operations, and have generated and continue to generate wastes, which have been or may be deemed to be hazardous or dangerous. As such, our business is subject to and may be materially and adversely affected by compliance obligations and other liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect ongoing operations and require capital costs and operating expenditures in order to achieve and maintain compliance. 
 Adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our investments or impair our liquidity. 
 At the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately $24.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments held for sale. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in a mix of money market funds, bank demand deposit accounts and foreign bank accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our financial position. Our investment portfolio consists of state and municipal securities with various maturity dates, all of which have a credit rating of AA or above at the original purchase date; however, defaults by the issuers of any of these securities may result in an adverse impact on our portfolio. 
 The agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. 
 On February 28, 2017, we entered into a secured credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as lender, pursuant to which we borrowed a term loan in the amount of $9.2 million and established a $10.0 million revolving line of credit. All amounts borrowed pursuant to the credit facility are required to be paid in full no later than January 31, 2022. 
 The agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to: 
 

 | Incur future indebtedness;
--+---------------------------


 | Place liens on assets;
--+-----------------------


 | Pay dividends or distributions on our and our subsidiaries capital stock;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Repurchase or acquire our capital stock;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | Conduct mergers or acquisitions;
--+---------------------------------


 | Sell assets; and/or
--+--------------------


 | Alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 
 
These restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests. 
 AstroNova may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact AstroNovas overall business. 
 We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our June 2015 acquisition of the aerospace printer business from RITEC. We may continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete we cannot be certain that: 
 

 | We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 In certain instances as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks. 
 We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: 
 

 | Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. 
 If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or able to realize expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, AstroNovas business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
