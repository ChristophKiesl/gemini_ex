 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  INTRODUCTION 
  Kidoz Inc. (TSXV: KIDZ) is a mobile advertising technology company and owner of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network (www.kidoz.net) and the Kidoz Publisher Software Development Kit ("SDK").  By developing solutions for app developers to monetize with safe, relevant, and fun ads we help keep the Google and Apple app stores safe and free for children.  Our commitment to children's privacy and safety has created one of the fastest growing mobile networks in the world.  Unlike most digital advertising, every campaign on the Kidoz platform is free of location information, device identifiers, behavioural data, and other trackers used by advertisers to identify and track users across the Internet commonly known as IDFA and AAID.  Our technology does not rely on any permanent identifiers, and as Google and Apple begin to disallow persistent trackers from being employed by any network (child-directed or not), Kidoz's strength increases. '
  2020 was another pivotal year for the Company as we recorded record revenue, user growth, and profit on the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network. Powerful consumer, market and regulatory trends are fueling Kidoz's growth.  Advertisers spend their budgets where there are high concentrations of users and as the Kidoz kids user base is the largest, the Company expects to capture an increasing portion of the child and family directed advertising spend in the market.  Advertisers are searching for new and innovative ways to reach their audiences and while mobile advertising is not new, marketers of toys and other child directed products have overly relied on television in the past.  As television viewing declines and new channels such as mobile are tested by marketers, a shift in the child-directed advertising landscape increasingly unfolds.
  By addressing the privacy concerns of all our users, we ensure regulatory compliance with privacy laws including Google and Apple's strict rules for mobile apps on the Android and iOS platforms.  Since Google's certification of Kidoz and Apple's rules endorsing Kidoz's methodologies, the Company is experiencing unprecedented demand for its safe advertising solutions which now reaches more than 300,000,000 kids a month.  Advertisers benefit from the brand safety that our technology creates and the compliant contextual targeting opportunities that we deliver.  However, the greatest benefit of the Kidoz solution is enjoyed by Kidoz advertising customers in the high quality media spots on the network.  As Kidoz is a mobile network, our users are highly engaged on their devices at the time advertising is delivered which results in excellent performance.
  Kidoz is the market leader in child and pre-teen safe mobile advertising and the segment is only beginning to develop as new rules and stricter regulations are being enacted and enforced by Google, Apple, and governments around the world who demand privacy and safety for children online.  The Kidoz proprietary advertising technology is installed in thousands of different apps, making it the most 
  Page 3
  popular child focused mobile solution in the market.  Our KIDOZ Safe Ad Network offers publishers a unique technology and monetization solution that every app with kids traffic can use to compliantly monetize their content. '
  Driving our revenue growth is strong underlying system growth for both users and publishers that are using our Kidoz technology.  Media budgets continue to shift from linear TV to digital platforms like Kidoz as brands seek to engage their customers where kids spend most of their screen time.  As mobile penetration among kids continues to increase the global usage of mobile is steadily increasing.  In addition, regulation at the government level is positively influencing growth of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network. COPPA in America and GDPR in Europe have forced advertisers and publishers to ensure their data and advertising methodologies are safe. Regulators in America are considering updating COPPA to further enhance child safety online, and regulators in China, India and other regions are considering similar measures. As Kidoz is compliant, the Company benefits from all child-safe advertising regulation.'
  As we invest in Kidoz products and methodologies to protect kids and help our mobile partners to monetize their content safely, we increase the value that we can provide to our advertisers.  Our strong 2020 results are an indication of Kidoz's importance in a large and growing market.  Management believes that our strategy will continue to be a success in 2021.'
  Kidoz's mobile products include the Kid Mode Operating System installed on millions of OEM tablets worldwide, Rooplay (www.rooplay.com) the cloud-based EduGame system for kids to learn and play, Garfield's Bingo (www.garfieldsbingo.com) live on Facebook Messenger, Android, and iOS; and Trophy Bingo (www.trophybingo.com), live across mobile platforms.

  Development of the Business'
  The focus of Kidoz Inc. is the development and expansion of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network which provides a safe and securely curated environment for our kids focused advertisers. The size of the child directed advertising market is estimated in excess of $1.7 billion so the percentage spent on mobile advertising is small but growing quickly.  It is our intention to explore expanding, either through new uses of our advancing technology systems to access the wider mobile advertising ecosystem, or via synergistic M&A opportunities. As developments in privacy laws in almost every country worldwide move to provide additional protection to digital minors by controlling digital services and, potentially in some cases, raising the age of minority, Kidoz's importance in the digital advertising eco-system increases.  
   Kidoz Inc. Domain Names
  Kidoz Inc. owns the domain names Kidoz.net, Rooplay.com, Shoalgames.com, Shoalgames.net, Shoalmedia.com, Garfieldsbingo.com, Trophybingo.com, Trophybingo.ca and many other smaller domains.  
  BUSINESS OVERVIEW
  Kidoz Inc. is an AdTech software developer and owner of the leading mobile KIDOZ Safe Ad Network (www.kidoz.net). We help create a free and safe Internet for children, by enabling content producers to monetize their apps and video with safe, relevant, and fun ads.  Our commitment to children's privacy and safety has created one of the fastest growing mobile networks in the world.  
 Product Strategy
  Kidoz builds and maintains the Kidoz SDK that app developers install into their apps before releasing them into the App Stores.  The Kidoz SDK is the core of the advertising technology that enables Kidoz to have advertising impressions available for sale.  The Kidoz proprietary advertising system is compliant with COPPA, GDPR-K and other regulations adopted to protect children in a complex digital world.  While a closed proprietary system design made sense for the initial phase of Kidoz, digital
 Page 5
  advertising systems are constantly evolving and Kidoz is no exception.  Kidoz continues to upgrade its advertising systems to be compatible with the latest IAB specifications for real-time-bidding, header bidding, and server-to-server direct connections.  Our design of these upgrades incorporates a view to their utilization, not only in the kid's marketplace but to the entire advertising market. The upgrades in the Kidoz platform increases our commitment to protect children, increases the value we offer to our publishing partners, and increases the transparency we provide to the advertisers on the Kidoz system. In addition, we are building the foundation to increase the capabilities of our technology to handle more types of mobile advertising thereby significantly increasing the reach and the size of our addressable market. 
 Marketing & Distribution Strategy
  Each new app that installs the Kidoz SDK increases our user base and increases the number of available impressions that Kidoz can monetize.  The adoption of the Kidoz SDK has been very rapid over the years as app developers have very few choices when it comes to sources of safe, compliant, and relevant ads for their users.  Kidoz has built its brand and reputation as the market leader for safe child and family mobile advertising technology and this has enabled our SDK to become quickly adopted.  It is our strategy to invest in our systems and build alliances with the largest software companies in the world.  Since Google's certification of Kidoz and Apple's updated rules endorsing Kidoz's methodologies the Company is experiencing unprecedented demand for its safe advertising solutions which now reaches more than 300,000,000 kids a month. 
 Sales & Pricing Strategy
  Kidoz has a global sales agency partnership strategy that places local sellers into many national and international markets.  Through our direct sales and marketing channels we locate, recruit and sign new international sales houses.  As the Kidoz network is a unique advertising platform in the market, it commands high prices and media sales houses want to represent the Company.  Kidoz has found the agency partnership strategy to be highly effective as once sales houses are recruited and the first few campaigns are delivered with success, repeat customers are established and the region begins to grow.  After years of development with this strategy, Kidoz has many established sales houses in the largest economies of the world and is now tasked with finding new sales partnerships in regions that are large, but less developed economically.  As Kidoz is able to monetize a higher percentage of the impressions available on the network growth will continue to increase.  
 Growth Strategy
  Building on Kidoz's high-growth performance in 2020, management plans to further invest in similar growth strategies in 2021.  Our sales, product, and operational strategies are custom fit to match the favourable regulatory, consumer, and technological trends occurring in the market. Kidoz is actively recruiting the biggest and most successful apps in the world to offer our technology to their kids audiences for monetization.  Each time a new app adopts our technology, our advertising inventory increases and we offer increased value to our advertising partners.  The Company is developing technology to access a wider range of inventories app types so that we can continue to increase Kidoz's capabilities and importance in the market.  
  Furthermore, while the focus of the Company is the development and expansion of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network, we are investigating options to use our technology to expand into new markets, either through new connections to the wider mobile advertising market, or via synergistic M&A. 
   Acquisition of Kidoz Ltd. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Kidoz Ltd. ("Kidoz"), an Israel-based industry-leader in the global kids' content distribution and monetization marketplace.

  number of devices the Kidoz Kid Mode OS is installed. The Company is continuing to look for new licenses and to grow our existing agreements. 
   Rooplay
  The Company owns Rooplay (www.rooplay.com) the cloud-based EduGame system for kids to play multiple games to learn and play. The platform is live ' on the Google's Android system and has stand-alone games available on Apple's iOS and Google's Android systems.  
 Trophy Bingo & Garfield's Bingo
  The Company has the social bingo games Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo which are available on Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Amazon Android systems.  Revenue is generated in the games via in-app purchases and advertising. 
 OPERATIONS 
  Employees
  As of December 31, 2020, we had fourteen full-time employees, not including temporary personnel, consultants, and independent contractors in Canada and Israel. Since 2006 it has been, and continues to be, the Company's objective to control its costs by retaining consultants, as needed, to provide special expertise in developing internal strategic, marketing, accounting and technical services. None of our employees or consultants are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and consultants is good.
  We are substantially dependent upon the continued services and performance of J. M. Williams, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Eldad Ben Tora, Co-Chief Executive Officer and T. M. Williams, Executive Chairman.  The loss of the services of these key individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not carry any key man life insurance on any individuals.
  Competition
  Kidoz competes with other advertising technology providers that offer safe, COPPA compliant, products.  These companies include Super Awesome and Google's Admob.  As the technology barriers are high to enter the market with a mobile advertising network, few competitors exist for Kidoz.  Kidoz offers a highly customized and targeted offering to advertisers that management believes will enable the Company to grow and succeed in the market.'
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
  The Company is in the business of developing and marketing mobile products and services for kids in a digital world. To the best of our knowledge, no federal, state or local environmental laws are applicable to our business.
