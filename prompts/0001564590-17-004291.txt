Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. Our pipeline consists of small molecule product candidates that target cancer signaling pathways, and we intend to pair them with molecular or cellular diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to respond to treatment. We intend to advance our product candidates through a combination of internal development and strategic partnerships and maintain significant development and commercial rights.
 Precision medicine is an approach to the treatment of cancer in which treatment decisions are made based upon the presence or absence of specific molecular or genetic biomarkers that characterize an individual’s tumor. As diagnostic testing of cancer patients has become more widespread, we are learning that tumors arising in diverse sites in the body may share the same types of molecular or genetic alterations, and it is those alterations that drive the cancer rather than the tissue of origin. In addition, research and clinical data suggest that some tumors have specific alterations that render them highly susceptible to product candidates that target those specific alterations.
 Our lead product candidate, tipifarnib, is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. Tipifarnib has been studied in more than 5,000 cancer patients and has demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients with a manageable side effect profile. We are evaluating tipifarnib in four Phase 2 clinical trials: the first in patients with locally advanced solid tumors that carry mutations in the Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, or HRAS, gene; the second in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, or PTCL; the third in patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS; and the fourth in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML. Our goals with our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib are to confirm the clinical activity of tipifarnib in each disease indication, to validate biomarker hypotheses and to optimize dose and schedule for each disease to build a data package supporting advancement to pivotal study.
 Our second product candidate is KO-947, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal related kinase, or ERK, which we are advancing as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have mutations in, or other dysregulation of, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, signaling pathway. KO-947 demonstrates prolonged pathway inhibition, both in cells, or in vitro, and in animal models, or in vivo, enabling the potential for intermittent dosing on schedules up to once weekly. Additionally, the drug properties of KO-947 support an intravenous formulation, which may allow for higher drug concentration, and potentially improved tolerability in the clinic. We submitted an investigational new drug, or IND, application for KO-947 to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which became effective in December 2016, and we anticipate initiation of our Phase 1 clinical trial of KO-947 in the first half of 2017.
 Our third program is KO-539, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the menin-mixed lineage leukemia, or menin-MLL, protein-protein interaction. Chromosomal translocations of the MLL gene play a causative role in the onset, development and progression of a subset of acute leukemias, and the activity of the MLL fusion proteins are critically dependent on binding the protein menin. Our preclinical data demonstrates that inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction induced robust and durable regressions in multiple models of MLL-fusion leukemias. We nominated KO-539 as a development candidate for this program in December 2016.

Precision Medicines in Cancer Treatment
 Advancements in cancer genetics and new molecular diagnostic tools are helping define why some patients respond to a specific therapy while other patients receive little to no clinical benefit. This new era in cancer drug discovery and development offers the potential for innovative treatments that are safer and more effective for patients with specific cancers. We aim to improve patient outcomes and contribute to the reduction in healthcare costs by matching targeted therapeutics to the patients who will derive the most benefit. We are developing a pipeline of small molecule product candidates designed to inhibit the mutated or abnormally functioning cellular pathways that drive cancer growth and intend to pair them with molecular diagnostics to identify those patients with tumors most likely to respond to treatment. This approach to treatment is known as precision medicine. 
 A pioneering example of a precision medicine in cancer was the development of small molecule inhibitors against epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, in patients with advanced lung cancer. Researchers discovered that a subset of a lung cancer was associated with dysregulation of EGFR, and several small molecule product candidates, including erlotinib (Tarceva®) and gefitinib (Iressa®), were discovered and advanced into clinical testing. During the clinical trials, investigators realized that patients who had mutations in EGFR experienced a much higher response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with meaningful tumor shrinkage on their clinical imaging scans, relative to an unselected patient population when treated with Tarceva or Iressa. Specifically, patients with EGFR mutations have a response rate in the 65% range, as opposed to the 10% range noted in unselected lung patients. Tarceva was subsequently approved in the United States as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer characterized by EGFR mutations. Other examples of approved agents developed using precision medicine approaches include inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK, inhibitors of the Philadelphia chromosome, or BCR-ABL, and inhibitors of B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, or BRAF.
 Precision medicine has a several advantages over traditional drug development. We believe evidence-based selection of patients who are more likely to respond to a targeted therapy based on tumor biology provides the potential for: higher translatability from preclinical to clinical studies; increased overall response rates requiring fewer patients for clinical development; and expedited clinical development in areas of high unmet need. We believe the precision medicine approach has the potential for more efficient drug development with reduced risks, costs and timelines. However, achieving success through a precision medicine approach is predicated on a thorough understanding of tumor biology and the mechanism of action of the product candidate. To develop this understanding, we have conducted extensive translational research on each of our programs.

Our Approach to Development of Precision Medicines in Oncology
 Translational research is the practice of synthesizing our knowledge of basic research, preclinical and clinical data to develop a “bench-to-bedside” understanding of the potential of our product candidates, and it is the principal methodology we utilize to guide our precision medicine approach. We evaluate our product candidates through both in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate their potential as therapeutics. One of the key tools we employ are patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models. PDX models mostly retain the principal histologic and genetic characteristics of their donor tumor and have been shown in many instances to be predictive of clinical outcomes and are increasingly being used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biologic studies and personalized medicine strategies. We evaluate our product candidates in preclinical PDX studies seeking to corroborate clinical data and in our preclinical programs, to identify potential clinical indications.
 In our experience, preclinical studies in PDX models are likely to be more informative late in preclinical development once we have generated a product candidate that we believe sufficiently inhibits the therapeutic target of interest. PDX models can be selected based on tumor types or on predefined molecular subtypes if that information is known and of interest, or both. We typically follow a two-step approach. In the first step, we use a limited number of models and test them with our product candidate at doses and schedules known to be effective and pharmacologically active in earlier preclinical studies. Data from the first step can be used to proceed to a second step and to refine model selection based on molecular understanding of responsive models. In the second step, a larger repertoire of models can be treated. The results of such a PDX campaign can inform our decision of whether to proceed to clinical development and which indications and biomarkers to prioritize in the clinical phase.
 Because we often target molecular and/or genetic alterations that are detectable, companion diagnostic tests can be developed to identify these alterations. Once we have identified a target, we will initially use existing diagnostic tools to identify patient subsets that we believe will derive increased benefit from our product candidates. As we advance our product candidates clinically and determine the most important screening criteria, we intend to develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to seek to identify patients, and if our clinical development programs are successful, to support the potential registration and marketing of our product candidates.
 Our clinical development strategy employs a disciplined approach designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. Based upon the data from our preclinical studies as well as any data from any third party preclinical and clinical data, we seek to evaluate our product candidates in well-defined patient populations and believe this gives us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach is intended to allow for early insight into the therapeutic potential of a product candidate and the possibility for rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies. 
 We are employing some or all the steps above across our various programs as we advance our pipeline of targeted therapies. We believe the advantages of such an approach are the potential for higher translatability from preclinical to clinical studies, our ability to leverage clinical and pathology trends towards comprehensive tumor profiling and the potential for expedited clinical development.

Clinical Programs and Pipeline
 The following table summarizes our current product pipeline:

Tipifarnib —An Oral Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor
 Overview
 Tipifarnib is a new chemical entity, or NCE, and a member of a class of product candidates called farnesyl transferase inhibitors, or FTIs. Protein farnesylation is a key cell signaling process implicated in various cancer processes, including survival, growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Tipifarnib has been studied in more than 5,000 oncology patients and was observed to be generally well tolerated with a manageable side effect profile as a single agent. Although tipifarnib has a well-established safety profile and has demonstrated compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients, its activity has not been sufficient in any prior clinical trial to support marketing approval by the FDA. However, clinical and preclinical data suggest that, in certain selected patient populations, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options. Objective responses with evidence of durable clinical benefit have previously been observed in each of the four cancer types currently under Phase 2 study at Kura. We in-licensed tipifarnib from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, or Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, in December 2014, and have worldwide rights in all indications other than virology.
Development Strategy for Tipifarnib 
 Our development strategy employs a stepwise, disciplined approach, building upon prior observations of clinical benefit and designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. Based upon clinical data from us and others, including Janssen, as well as data from our preclinical studies, we seek to evaluate tipifarnib in well-defined patient populations that we believe give us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a compelling clinical benefit.
 We currently have four company sponsored Phase 2 clinical studies ongoing with tipifarnib: the first in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, or SCCHN, that carry HRAS mutations, and patients with HRAS mutant thyroid cancer; the second in patients with PTCL; the third in patients with lower-risk MDS; and the fourth in patients with CMML. Tipifarnib is also being evaluated in an investigator sponsored clinical trial in patients with urothelial carcinoma tumors characterized by HRAS mutations. 
 Our goals with our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib are to confirm the clinical activity of tipifarnib in each disease indication and to optimize dose and schedule for each disease to build a data package supporting advancement to

pivotal study. In addition, we are seeking to address a set of criteria, which if satisfied, would support further clinical development. Those criteria include: biomarker validation; evidence of durable clinical benefit, potential for rapid clinical development; potential to move into earlier lines of therapy; attractive U.S. oncology commercial market; and potential for patent and regulatory exclusivity.
 We anticipate we will have additional data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in HRAS mutant solid tumors and from our Phase 2 clinical trial in PTCL in 2017 and data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in lower-risk MDS and our Phase 2 clinical trial in CMML in the first half of 2018. If the data from one or more of these Phase 2 clinical trials supports further clinical development, we would plan to initiate a registrational clinical trial of tipifarnib in at least one disease indication.
 Protein Farnesylation and Tipifarnib
 Tipifarnib is a potent and selective inhibitor of protein farnesylation. Certain cellular proteins must associate with the intracellular membrane to function. One of the mechanisms by which proteins are associated with the membrane is protein farnesylation, which modifies the protein by attaching a farnesyl group. Another, related mechanism is protein geranylgeranylation, which is attachment of a geranylgeranyl group to the protein. Protein farnesylation and protein geranylgeranylation, collectively called protein prenylation, cause intracellular proteins to become anchored to the inside of the cell membrane due to the hydrophobic nature of the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups.
 The enzyme that catalyzes the attachment of the farnesyl groups to proteins is called farnesyl transferase. Small molecule inhibitors of the FTIs have been discovered, and several including tipifarnib have been evaluated in human clinical trials. Many proteins involved in cellular signaling undergo prenylation because they must be associated with other proteins at the inner cellular membrane of the tumor cell to function. Treatment of tumors with FTIs results in the reversal of several hallmarks of cancer, including mitotic arrest, induction of apoptosis, growth inhibition, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth, as well as induction of tumor regression in animal models. 
 Among the hundreds of proteins that are estimated to be prenylated, most are either exclusively farnesylated or geranylgeranylated; some are both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, and others are naturally farnesylated but become geranylgeranylated, when farnesyl transferase is inhibited. HRAS is an example of a protein that is exclusively farnesylated while Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, or KRAS, and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog, or NRAS, are two proteins that are naturally farnesylated but may become geranylgeranylated upon treatment with FTIs.
 One of our strategies is to identify the farnesylated proteins and signaling pathways, the inhibition of which is responsible for the antitumor effects of tipifarnib. In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with HRAS mutant SCCHN, our initial clinical activity demonstrates that HRAS is one such protein. Similarly, our preclinical data in PDX models of SCCHN also demonstrate consistent and significant anti-tumor activity. In our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with CMML, we are evaluating our hypothesis that tipifarnib may be less efficacious in patients with mutations in either NRAS or KRAS, which we believe is due to their ability to utilize the geranylgeranyl transferase for localization to the intracellular membrane and leads to resistance to tipifarnib. 
 With an improved understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of farnesylation as well as new approaches and technologies, including next-generation sequencing, or NGS, we believe we can identify proteins critically important to tumor cells and that are uniquely farnesylated. This may both enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of tipifarnib, and enable us to select patients whose tumors are sensitive to inhibition of farnesyl transferase and who are more likely to respond to these treatments.
 HRAS Mutant Tumors
 Market Opportunity
 Retrovirus-associated DNA sequences, or RAS, is a family of membrane-associated proteins that are involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. HRAS is a member of the RAS family, which includes two other proto-oncogenes: KRAS and NRAS. Collectively, the three RAS genes constitute one of the most frequently mutated families of oncogenes in human cancers. Although HRAS mutations are less common overall relative to KRAS and NRAS mutations, they have a relatively high prevalence in cancers of the upper digestive tract, skin, thyroid and urinary bladder. 
 Collectively, cancers that have an HRAS mutation are estimated to have an annual incidence of approximately 8,000 patients in the United States. SCCHN and squamous non-small cell lung cancer, or Sq-NSCLC, are together estimated to 
 
6


represent more than half the total, with an estimated annual U.S. incidence of approximately 2,800 to 3,400 patients for SCCHN and 1,000 to 1,700 patients for Sq-NSCLC. 
 SCCHN is a cancer that arises from a squamous cell. Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. SCCHN develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat and is classified by its location. SCHNN is caused by a variety of factors that can alter the DNA in cells. The strongest risk factors for developing this form of cancer are tobacco use, including smoking or using chewing tobacco, and heavy alcohol consumption. In addition, infection with certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, is linked to the development of SCCHN. HPV infection is one of the factors that accounts for the increasing incidence of SCCHN among younger people.
 Researchers have identified mutations in many genes in people with SCCHN; however, it is not yet clear what role most of these mutations play in the development or progression of cancer. One gene implicated in the development and progression of SCCHN is HRAS, and HRAS mutant SCCHN represents a significant unmet medical need. The relapsed and/or refractory SCCHN patient population has an overall survival of approximately six to eight months and few therapeutic options, and new therapies, including immunotherapy, typically show a response rate in the range of 10-20%.
 In addition to HRAS mutations present at the time of initial diagnosis, both published preclinical and clinical data suggest that the proportion of patients with HRAS mutations increases as HRAS is a mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in SCCHN. HRAS mutations have been shown to be a mechanism of resistance to both erlotinib and cetuximab in SCCHN cell lines, and RAS-mediated acquired resistance to cetuximab has been observed in SCCHN patients. As cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy represents a current standard of care for the front-line treatment of patients with SCCHN, the potential presence of HRAS mutations as a mechanism of acquired resistance could enlarge the potential market opportunity for tipifarnib as a treatment for HRAS mutant SCCHN.
 HRAS as a Human Oncogene
 The HRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. Growth factors act by binding cell surface receptors that span the cell’s plasma membrane. Once activated, receptors stimulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm, a process by which proteins and second messengers relay signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus and instruct the cell to grow or divide. HRAS is localized in the plasma membrane, and is an early player in many signal transduction pathways. HRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch – once HRAS is turned “on” it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of the receptor’s signal. In certain tumors, mutations in HRAS or its upstream regulators cause HRAS to be permanently “on,” resulting in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth. FTIs work to prevent the aberrant growth and proliferation of cells that are dependent on these signaling pathways by inhibiting protein farnesylation and subsequent membrane localization of HRAS, thereby switching HRAS “off.” HRAS membrane localization is solely dependent on protein farnesylation, and therefore we believe that tipifarnib has the potential for the treatment of HRAS mutant solid tumors.
 Clinical Development in HRAS Mutant Tumors
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in May 2015 to test the hypothesis that tipifarnib can be used as a treatment for advanced tumors with a known HRAS mutation. We designed this clinical trial based on preclinical data which demonstrated that tipifarnib inhibits HRAS mutant cell proliferation and HRAS tumor growth in mouse models. Sponsorship of the investigational new drug application, or IND, for tipifarnib previously filed by Janssen has been transferred to us. The clinical trial is designed to enroll 2 cohorts of 18 patients each. Cohort 1 is enrolling subjects with malignant thyroid tumors with HRAS mutations, independently of thyroid histology. Cohort 2 was initially designed to enroll any subject with a non-hematological HRAS mutant tumor other than thyroid cancer who meets the eligibility criteria. This clinical trial has a two-stage study design to minimize the number of study subjects treated if tipifarnib is not sufficiently efficacious. If more than one response is observed in the cohort, seven additional subjects will be enrolled (stage 2). If one or no objective response is observed in a cohort after the first 11 evaluable patients, the cohort will be closed to further enrollment. The clinical trial will be considered positive if at least four responses are observed in a cohort (out of 18 subjects). The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and tumor response assessments will be conducted according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria (confirmation of response is required). 
 In March 2017, we presented data from stage 1 of our ongoing Phase 2 HRAS clinical trial at the 15th International Congress on Targeted Anticancer Therapies, including data from a small cohort of three patients with HRAS mutant SCCHN as well as data from preclinical studies. We reported that, among the three patients with HRAS mutant SCCHN treated with 
 
7


tipifarnib, we had observed two patients with confirmed partial responses, who had been on study for more than 16 months and 10 months, respectively, as well as a third patient who experienced disease stabilization for seven months. We also reported data on a small cohort of patients with HRAS mutant salivary gland cancer, who experienced prolonged disease stabilization. 
 Our clinical and preclinical data suggests that, among cancers with HRAS mutations, squamous cell tumors, such as SCCHN and Sq-NSCLC, are among the more sensitive tumors to treatment with tipifarnib. Based upon the clinical activity we observed in patients with HRAS mutant SCCHN treated with tipifarnib, we have amended the protocol of our Phase 2 clinical trial to focus enrollment in the second stage of the second cohort entirely on patients with HRAS mutant SCCHN. To facilitate enrollment, we are adding additional clinical sites outside the United States and are engaging with third party laboratories to provide screening of patient samples for HRAS mutant status. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities to evaluate the activity of tipifarnib in HRAS mutant Sq-NSCLC.
 Investigator Sponsored Trial in HRAS Mutant Urothelial Carcinoma
 In addition to the company sponsored Phase 2 clinical trials, a Phase 2 investigator sponsored clinical trial of tipifarnib for the treatment of advanced, previously treated urothelial carcinomas that carry HRAS mutations, was initiated in November 2015. This clinical trial is sponsored by the Samsung Medical Center and designed to enroll at least 18 patients. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is objective response rate, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety.
Companion Diagnostics
 Patients are currently being enrolled in the Phase 2 HRAS mutant tumor clinical trials based either upon information from the clinical sites on the patients’ tumor HRAS mutation status or upon this information obtained from third party laboratories who conduct genetic screening on patient samples for the clinical sites. If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial in HRAS mutant SCCHN cancer are positive, we plan to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients with HRAS mutant tumors in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib and to prepare and submit an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for use of the assay in such clinical trials. We expect that the companion diagnostic test will either be a qualitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, -based assay or an NGS-based assay. A qPCR-based assay would be technically similar to the qPCR-based assay already developed and approved by the FDA for KRAS. We expect that regulatory approval of tipifarnib as a treatment for patients with HRAS mutant tumors will require FDA approval of an HRAS assay in the form of a companion diagnostic test that has been validated for accuracy, precision and reproducibility.
Peripheral T-Cell Leukemia
 Market Opportunity
 Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer. The two main forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or HL, and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL. Lymphoma occurs when cells of the immune system called lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. Cancerous lymphocytes can travel to many parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, or other organs, and form tumors. The body has two main types of lymphocytes that can develop into lymphomas: B-cells and T-cells.
 PTCL consists of a group of rare and usually aggressive (fast-growing) NHLs that develop from mature T-cells. PTCLs collectively account for about five to ten percent of all NHL cases, corresponding to an annual incidence of approximately 5,000 patients per year in the United States. By some estimates, the incidence of PTCL is growing significantly, and the increasing incidence may be attributable to an aging population.
 PTCLs are sub-classified into various subtypes, each of which are typically considered to be separate diseases based on their distinct clinical differences. Most of these subtypes are rare; the three most common subtypes are PTCL not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, or AITL, and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, or ALCL, that collectively account for approximately 70 percent of all PTCLs in the United States.
 
8


Treatment Options for PTCL
 For most PTCL subtypes, the frontline treatment regimen is typically combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), EPOCH (etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone), or other multi-drug regimens.
 Patients who relapse or are refractory to frontline treatments are typically treated with gemcitabine in combination with other chemotherapies, including gemcitabine, vinorelbine (Navelbine®) and doxorubicin (Doxil®) in a regimen called GND, or other chemotherapy regimens such as DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin) or ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, and cisplatin).
 Because most patients with PTCL will relapse, some oncologists recommend giving high-dose chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant to some patients who had a good response to their initial chemotherapy. Non-cytotoxic therapies that have been approved for relapsed or refractory PTCL, such as pralatrexate (Folotyn®), romidepsin (Istodax®) and belinostat (Beleodaq®), are associated with relatively low objective response rates (25-27% overall response rate, or ORR) and relatively short durations of response (8.2-9.4 months). Accordingly, we believe the treatment of relapsed/refractory PTCL remains a significant unmet medical need.
 The five-year survival for patients with PTCL is low—roughly 35% by most published records—and few treatment options provide a durable treatment effect. Treatments in the relapsed or refractory setting are not very effective. Therefore, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines currently recommend that patients seek participation in a clinical trial for the initial treatment.
 Previous Phase 2 Experience with Tipifarnib in the Treatment of PTCL
 A prior Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted at the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa from 2004 to 2009 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. As part of that study, 93 patients with various B-cell and T-cell lymphomas were enrolled, including 17 patients with T-cell lymphoma, and patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. Tipifarnib was generally well tolerated on this dose and schedule. Across all 93 patients, the grade 3 or 4 toxicities were primarily reversible myelosuppression, with 11% anemia, 37% neutropenia, and 32% thrombocytopenia.
 Although the clinical trial enrolled a relatively small number of patients with T-cell lymphomas, a 41% response rate (seven responses out of 17 patients) was observed in patients with T-cell NHL, including four objective responses out of eight patients with PTCL (three complete response, or CR, and one partial response). We believe the results observed from this Phase 2 clinical trial suggest that tipifarnib can be administered for prolonged periods and may produce durable responses as a single agent in relapsed lymphoma in a group of patients who were heavily pretreated, including those with PTCL.
 Clinical Development in PTCL
 Based on the promising results observed in the Phase 2 lymphoma study at the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in September 2015 to test the hypothesis that tipifarnib can be used as a treatment for relapsed or refractory PTCL. This clinical trial is being conducted under the IND that was transferred to us from Janssen. Our goals with the Kura-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial are to confirm the clinical activity of tipifarnib, to validate biomarker hypotheses and to optimize dose and schedule for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. 
 The current study protocol has a two-stage design for a total number of 18 eligible patients. If one or no objective response is observed after the first 11 evaluable patients (stage 1), the study will be closed to further enrollment. If more than one response is observed, seven additional patients will be enrolled (stage 2). The clinical trial will be considered positive if at least four responses are observed (out of 18 patients). The primary endpoint is objective response rate, and tumor response assessments are conducted according to the International Workshop Criteria for the assessment of responses in lymphoma. Potential biomarkers that may contribute to the identification of patients who may benefit from tipifarnib therapy will be investigated in the study. These include genes that are expressed and/or mutated in tumor samples, and blood circulating cytokines.

In March 2017, we reported that both stage 1 and stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial have been fully enrolled. We have observed initial signals of clinical activity, including three objective responses, and one additional patient is pending best response assessment. In addition, potential biomarkers have been identified that may allow us to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from treatment with tipifarnib. Based on this preliminary data we have amended the trial protocol to enroll approximately 12 additional patients to seek to verify the initial observations.
 Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 Market Opportunity
 MDS are a group of hematopoietic stem cell malignancies with significant morbidity and mortality. MDS is characterized by ineffective blood cell production, or hematopoiesis, leading to low blood cell counts, or cytopenias, and high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. MDS is a highly heterogeneous disease, and the severity of symptoms and disease progression can vary widely among patients. The current standard clinical tool to evaluate risk stratification, including survival and risk for AML transformation, and treatment options is the revised International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS-R. The IPSS-R differentiates patients into five risk groups (Very Low, Low, Intermediate, High, Very High) based on evaluation of cytogenetics, percentage of blasts (undifferentiated blood cells) in the bone marrow, hemoglobin levels, and platelet and neutrophil counts.
 According to the American Cancer Society, or ACS, the annual incidence of MDS is approximately 13,000 patients in the United States, the majority of which are 60 years of age or older. The estimated prevalence is over 60,000 patients in the United States. Approximately 75% of patients fall into the IPSS-R risk categories of Very Low, Low, and Intermediate, collectively known as lower risk MDS, which is our target patient population for our planned Phase 2 MDS clinical trial.
 Treatment Options for MDS
 Therapeutic options fall into three categories including supportive care, low intensity therapy and high intensity therapy. Supportive care includes the use of red blood cell and platelet transfusions as well as administration of hematopoietic cytokines such as erythropoiesis stimulating agents or colony stimulating factors to improve blood counts. Low intensity therapies include hypomethylating agents such as azacytidine (Vidaza®) and decitabine (Dacogen®), biological response modifiers such as lenalidomide (Revlimid®), and immunosuppressive treatments such as cyclosporine A or antithymocyte globulin. High intensity therapies include chemotherapeutic agents such as idarubicin, cytarabine, fludarabine and topotecan, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
 National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, guidelines recommend that lower risk patients (IPSS-R groups Very Low, Low, Intermediate) receive supportive care or low intensity therapies with the major therapeutic goal of hematologic improvement, or HI. A substantial portion of lower risk MDS patients lack effective therapies, and NCCN guidelines recommend clinical trials as additional therapeutic options. We believe that treatment of MDS remains a significant unmet need requiring the development of novel therapies.
 Previous Phase 2 Experience with Tipifarnib in the Treatment of MDS
 A prior Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib was sponsored by Johnson & Johnson and conducted at 19 sites in seven countries from 2002 to 2006 in adult patients with intermediate to high risk MDS. This study also included patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Eighty-two patients with IPSS-R scores of Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and High risk MDS were enrolled in the study, and patients received tipifarnib 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. The median age of patients was 67 (range 39-86 years). The median time since diagnosis was 8.8 months (range 0-128 months) and 37% (30 of 82) had been received prior therapy. The ORR for all patients was 31.7% (26 of 82), with 14.6% (12 of 82) CR and 17.1% (14 of 82) HI. In the 12 complete responders, the median response duration was 11.5 months (range 2.0-21.9 months), and the median TTP was 12.4 months (3.9-23.8 months). Median duration of HI was 18 weeks (range six to 76 weeks). Median OS was 11.7 months for all patients.

Tipifarnib was generally well tolerated. Ten patients died during the treatment period with five deaths due to progressive disease and five due to an adverse event of which only one was considered drug-related. This death was due to coronary insufficiency triggered by anemia and severe internal bleeding in the context of nonresponsive MDS with persistent Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events were primarily neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, and were reported as possibly drug-related in 15 patients (18%), 26 patients (32%), and 15 patients (18%), respectively. We believe the results of this study suggest that tipifarnib may produce durable responses as a single agent in patients with intermediate to high risk MDS.
 Clinical Development in MDS
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the anti-tumor activity of tipifarnib in patients with lower risk MDS in the second quarter of 2016. We have prioritized lower risk MDS because of the prevalence of this disease and our belief that treatment of lower risk MDS remains a significant unmet medical need. We expect that the activity of tipifarnib in lower risk MDS will be no less than the activity observed in the previously investigated intermediate/high risk setting, which is a more aggressive form of the disease. Our Phase 2 study in lower risk MDS is designed to investigate the activity of tipifarnib in approximately 58 eligible subjects, and has a primary endpoint of transfusion independence according to the adult Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms International Working Group criteria or related response assessment system. Based on anecdotal evidence of hematological improvement observed in several patients enrolled in the study, we have amended the protocol to explore dose regimens to seek to optimize those initial observations.
 Exploratory Biomarkers
 We have identified potential biomarkers that could be predictive of response to tipifarnib in MDS patients. One of these potential biomarkers is the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS2, or KIR2DS2, which is commonly expressed on natural killer cells and some T-cells and serves to regulate their activity. Autoimmunity is known to play a key role in the onset of lower risk MDS, and KIR2DS2 has been shown to predispose patients to onset of both MDS and autoimmune diseases. KIR2DS2 is present in approximately 60% of MDS patients.
 Our interest in KIR2DS2 and other killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, or KIRs, was triggered by the results of our retrospective analysis of gene expression from bone marrow samples in 34 previously untreated poor-risk and elderly AML patients who were treated with tipifarnib in a prior Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP 20, Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Twenty-five of the patients in CTEP 20 had prior MDS. We observed that expression of several markers, including KIR2DS2, strongly correlated with clinical benefit, including complete response rate, progression free survival, and OS.
 We hypothesize that tipifarnib may influence the signaling of KIR2DS2 through its inhibition of protein farnesylation, either of RAS proteins or other farnesylated proteins in the cell. Through this mechanism, we believe that tipifarnib could improve patient outcomes. Because KIR2DS2 and the related receptor KIR2DS5 are known to predispose to autoimmunity and the onset of MDS, we believe that tipifarnib could attenuate the autoimmune process that causes severe cytopenias in lower risk MDS. This hypothesis is being evaluated in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in lower risk MDS.
 Companion Diagnostics
 If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial in MDS are positive, and KIR2DS2 or other immune cell markers are shown to be predictive of response to tipifarnib, we would expect to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib in this patient population. Genetic assays and semi-quantitative gene expression assay detecting the presence or absence of certain of these markers are already available and used in some instances in bone marrow transplantation. 
Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
 Market Opportunity
 CMML is a disorder of bone marrow stem cells in which an increase in white blood cells, or monocytosis, is a defining feature. The clinical presentation of CMML varies from predominantly myelodysplastic, an ineffective production of blood cells, to predominantly myeloproliferative, an overproduction of blood cells. CMML is primarily a disease of the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 65 to 75 years, and an estimated annual incidence of approximately 1,100 patients in the United States. 
 
11


Treatment Options for CMML
 The prognosis for patients with CMML is poor, with median survival of two to three years and a 15% to 20% risk of transformation to AML. The three-year survival for patients with CMML is low — roughly 29% by most published records — and few treatment options provide a durable treatment effect. Management of CMML typically focuses on supportive care as therapeutic options are limited. Accordingly, we believe treatment of adult CMML remains an unmet medical need.
 Previous Phase 2 Experience with Tipifarnib in the Treatment of CMML
 In a prior Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib sponsored by Johnson & Johnson and in adult patients with intermediate to high risk MDS, of the 82 patients treated, 19 were classified as having CMML according to the French American British classification. Based on an intent to treat analysis of these CMML patients using the International Working Group (2000) response criteria for MDS, responses were observed in four of the 19 patients (21%), with one CR and three complete responses with incomplete platelet recovery, or CRp. Median duration of response was 225 days and median time to transformation to AML was not estimable. Median overall survival in these patients was 440 days. Tipifarnib was generally well tolerated. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported across all patients were primarily myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. We believe the results observed from this Phase 2 clinical trial suggest that tipifarnib may produce durable responses as a single agent in patients with CMML.
 Clinical Development in CMML
 We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in CMML in October 2016. Our Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of tipifarnib in CMML. As part of the study, we also plan to test a biomarker hypothesis, which may allow us to identify those patients most likely to experience durable responses. We anticipate that the clinical trial would recruit approximately 20 patients.
 Exploratory Biomarkers
 We have identified potential biomarkers that could be predictive of response to tipifarnib in CMML patients. Two of these potential biomarkers are the proto-oncogenes NRAS and KRAS. Like the HRAS homolog, NRAS and KRAS proteins are involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. In certain tumors, mutations in KRAS or NRAS cause those proteins to be permanently “on,” resulting in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth. Mutations in NRAS or KRAS are present in approximately 30% of CMML patients.
 KRAS and NRAS are similar to HRAS in that they can utilize the protein farnesylation pathway for membrane localization; however, KRAS and NRAS are distinct from HRAS in that they can also utilize an alternate enzyme, the geranylgeranyl transferase, for membrane localization and become resistant to FTI treatment. We hypothesize that patients with NRAS mutant CMML will be less sensitive to treatment with tipifarnib relative to patients with the wild-type NRAS because NRAS will remain a driver of the disease even upon treatment with tipifarnib. If we validate our hypothesis in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, the likely development path for tipifarnib in CMML would be in the NRAS wild-type CMML population.
Companion Diagnostics
 If the results of our Phase 2 clinical trial in CMML are positive, and wild-type NRAS or KRAS are shown to be predictive of response to tipifarnib, we would expect to partner development and validation of a companion diagnostic test to aid in the selection of patients in subsequent clinical trials of tipifarnib in this patient population. Genetic assays detecting the presence or absence of certain of these genes and markers are already commercially available.
Registration Strategy for Tipifarnib
 Our goals with our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib are to confirm the clinical activity of tipifarnib in each disease indication, to validate biomarker hypotheses and to optimize dose and schedule for each disease to build a data package supporting advancement to pivotal study. For each disease indication, we plan to evaluate a number of criteria in determining whether to advance tipifarnib. These criteria include: biomarker validation, evidence of durable, clinical benefit, potential for rapid clinical development, potential to move into earlier lines of therapy, the potential for patent and regulatory exclusivity and the commercial potential. 
 
12


We anticipate we will have additional data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in HRAS mutant solid tumors and from our Phase 2 clinical trial in PTCL in 2017 and data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in lower-risk MDS  and our Phase 2 clinical trial in CMML in the first half of 2018. If the data from one or more of these Phase 2 clinical trials supports further clinical development, we would plan to initiate a registrational clinical trial of tipifarnib in at least one disease indication. The use of regulatory pathways such as orphan drug or breakthrough therapy designation will be driven by the specific patient population and data from the Phase 2 clinical trials.
 ERK Inhibitor Program
 Overview
 We are advancing KO-947, a small molecule inhibitor of ERK, as a potential treatment for patients with tumors that have dysregulated activity due to mutations or other mechanisms in the MAPK pathway, including lung cancers, colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers. We anticipate initiation of our Phase 1 clinical trial of KO-947 in the first half of 2017. We acquired KO-947 from Araxes Pharma LLC, or Araxes, a private biopharmaceutical company.
 Aberrant signaling caused by mutations or dysregulation of the MAPK pathway are frequent contributors to the development of cancer in humans and are associated with numerous tumor types. Many cancers harbor genetic mutations in components of the MAPK pathway, especially in protein kinases, that lock transformed cells in a pro-growth state, even in the absence of external growth signals. Studies have shown that such aberrations in the MAPK pathway, including mutations in KRAS or BRAF, and other components of the pathway, are frequent contributors to the development of cancer in humans. Targeted cancer drugs, including vemurafinib (ZELBORAF®) and dabrafenib (TAFINLAR®), trametinib (MEKINIST®) and cobimetinib (COTELLIC®), which are small molecule inhibitors of the proteins BRAF and MEK, respectively, and have been approved by the FDA for treatment of BRAF V600E mutant metastatic melanoma, are currently being investigated in other tumor types. We believe that these drugs have validated the use of small molecule inhibitors of the MAPK pathway in cancer. Although inhibitors of BRAF and MEK have demonstrated clinical activity in selected patients, durable responses in patients are limited, as median time to disease progression is approximately six to seven months and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the ERK signaling pathway. Accordingly, we believe that a therapeutic product candidate that can block signaling of the MAPK pathway through potent, selective and prolonged inhibition of ERK should reduce or prevent cancer growth and may have a beneficial effect for patients.
 KO-947 is a potent and selective inhibitor of ERK, exhibits potent anti-proliferative activity across a broad panel of tumor cell lines with mutations in BRAF, NRAS or KRAS and induces tumor regressions at tolerable doses in in vivo models. KO-947 demonstrates prolonged pathway inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo, enabling the potential for intermittent dosing on schedules up to once weekly. Additionally, the drug properties of KO-947 support an intravenous formulation, which may allow for increased drug concentration and potentially improved tolerability in the clinic. We believe these properties of KO-947 differentiate it from other ERK inhibitors currently in development.
Market Overview
 Activating mutations in the KRAS gene are commonly found in a wide variety of tumor types. Among cancer indications with large patient populations, KRAS mutations are found in approximately 93 percent of pancreatic cancers, approximately 40 percent of colorectal cancers and approximately 12 percent of NSCLC. According to the ACS in 2017, there are estimated to be over 54,000 cases of pancreatic cancer, 135,000 cases of colorectal cancer and over 190,000 cases of NSCLC diagnosed each year in the United States. We believe this corresponds to approximately 49,000 cases of KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, 54,000 cases of KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and 23,000 cases of KRAS mutant NSCLC each year in the United States. These cancers typically present relatively late in their clinical course, when locally directed therapy (surgery and radiation) is not curative. The treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cancers represents a significant unmet medical need.
Preclinical Data for KO-947 
 KO-947, demonstrates potent inhibition of the ERK kinase and high selectivity relative to a panel of approximately 400 kinases. KO-947 also demonstrates prolonged inhibition of the MAPK pathway in vivo. Following a single dose in vivo, KO-947 demonstrated a near complete inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling for more than72 hours. The prolonged inhibition of the pathway supports the potential for intermittent dosing schedules.
 
13


KO-947 has been evaluated in a panel of more than 100 different PDX models comprising 20 different clinical indications, utilizing intermittent dosing, to identify and prioritize potential lead clinical indications. Results obtained from these studies demonstrate that KO-947 induces tumor regressions in BRAF or RAS mutated tumor models as well as in tumor models lacking BRAF/RAS mutations but characterized by other dysregulations of the MAPK pathway. In each of these subsets of tumors characterized by mutation or dysregulation of the MAPK pathway, KO-947 demonstrated response rates of greater than 50%. Preclinical data for KO-947 was published in a poster presented at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, or EORTC, in Munich, Germany in November 2016.
 Through our preclinical studies we have identified potential development opportunities including KRAS and BRAF mutant cancers and squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, we have identified potential biomarkers to enable patient selection strategies for clinical development. Our goal is to identify those indications with the potential for single agent activity, enabling accelerated development. We believe the advantages of a precision medicine-based approach to the development of KO-947 include the potential for translatability from preclinical PDX studies to human clinical studies, the ability to leverage clinical and pathology trends towards comprehensive tumor profiling and the potential for meaningful single agent activity to permit more rapid clinical development and commercialization.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 We submitted an IND application for KO-947 to the FDA, which became effective in December 2016, and we anticipate initiation of our Phase 1 clinical trial of KO-947 in the first half of 2017. Our planned Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, of KO-947 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a recommended phase 2 dose will be determined. In addition, extension cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and seek to provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. The clinical trial is planned to be conducted at multiple centers in the United States and the European Union. 
 Menin-MLL Program
 Overview
 We are developing orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction, including the development candidate, KO-539, for the treatment of MLL-r and MLL-Partial Tandem Duplication, or MLL-PTD, acute leukemias, a genetically defined subtype of the two most common forms of acute leukemia, AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL. We licensed the menin-MLL program from the Regents of The University of Michigan, or the University of Michigan.
 The MLL gene is a common target of chromosomal translocations found in patients with AML and ALL, which affects both children and adults. Fusion of MLL with one of over 50 different partner genes forms oncogenes encoding MLL fusion proteins, which play a causative role in the onset, development and progression of MLL-r leukemias. MLL fusion proteins up-regulate expression of target genes involved in the malignant transformation of blood cells, however, the fusion protein is critically dependent on binding the oncogenic co-factor menin to function. This implies that the menin-MLL interaction represents a valuable target for molecular therapy.
 MLL-r leukemias are an aggressive subtype of two of the most common forms of acute leukemia, ALL and AML. The estimated five-year OS rate for adult patients with the MLL-r subtype of AML ranges from approximately 5% to 24%. Patients with MLL-r leukemias are routinely diagnosed using existing technologies that are commonly used in clinical settings. As a result, there is high awareness of MLL-r leukemias among oncologists. The disease predominantly occurs in two different demographics—an adult population and an infant/pediatric population. While they share a common genetic alteration, the adult disease is frequently a secondary leukemia resulting from prior chemotherapy for a different, unrelated cancer, and the childhood disease arises de novo. MLL-r leukemias are caused by a chromosomal translocation involving the MLL gene.
 Another subset of AML carries the MLL-PTD mutation that shares many of the hallmarks of MLL-r leukemias. MLL-PTD typically confers a worse prognosis with shortened overall and event free survival in childhood and adult AML. The annual incidence of MLL-r and MLL-PTD patients is estimated to be 3,500 patients in the United States, and those patients currently have limited options other than chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant. There are no approved therapies specifically indicated for either the MLL-r or MLL-PTD leukemias. We believe there remains a significant unmet medical need.
 
14


In preclinical studies, inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of the proliferation of MLL-r leukemia cell lines. We have further demonstrated that the inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction results in the down-regulation of MLL-r target genes, and an up-regulation of markers of differentiation. In vivo studies show robust and durable efficacy in multiple models of MLL-r leukemia, and demonstrate a strong correlation with the gene expression endpoints. Data was published in a poster presented at the EORTC in Munich, Germany in November 2016.
 Opportunity for Kura Oncology
 Our menin-MLL development program is aimed at identifying product candidates with the potential to effectively treat patients with MLL-r leukemias—a subset of adult and pediatric patients who today have no effective therapy—as well as MLL-PTD leukemias, a subset of AMLs that have no effective therapy. Additionally, we are evaluating oncology indications where menin dysregulation may play a role in the onset, development and progression of these cancers. We nominated KO-539 as a development candidate in December 2016.
 License and Asset Purchase Agreements 
 Janssen Pharmaceutica NV
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen, which was amended in June 2016, which grants us exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize tipifarnib in all indications other than virology and includes the right to grant subli
censes. We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tipifarnib and, with the exception of the transfer to us without cost of Janssen’s existing inventory of tipifarnib material, we are re
sponsible for all future development and commercialization costs for tipifarnib. Under the license agreement, Janssen has a first right to negotiate for an exclusive license back from us to develop and commercialize tipifarnib on terms to be negotiated in 
good faith. Janssen may exercise this right of first negotiation during the 60-day period following completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of tipifarnib in 
HRAS mutant patients in oncology and delivery by us to Janssen of a complete data package from such clinical trial.
 Under the terms of the license agreement, in January 2015 we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million to Johnson & Johnson Innovation—JJDC, Inc., which automatically converted into shares of common stock in our March 2015 private placement. When and if commercial sales of tipifarnib begin, we are obligated to pay Janssen tiered royalties of low double digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets in the event of generic competition or compulsory licenses, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering the licensed product in the field in such country, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity with respect to such product in such country, and ten years from our first commercial sale. We are also required to make regulatory milestone payments to Janssen of up to $25 million in the aggregate, if specified regulatory approvals are achieved for the first indication and additional payments for each subsequent indication if specified regulatory approvals are achieved. In addition, we are required to make sales milestone payments of up to $50 million in the aggregate if specified sales thresholds are surpassed. If we grant sublicenses under the license from Janssen, we are required to pay to Janssen a percentage of any upfront, lump-sum or milestone payments received from our sublicensee, subject to certain exclusions for regulatory milestone payments due under the license agreement.
 The license agreement with Janssen will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Janssen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the license agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Janssen can terminate the license agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tipifarnib.
 Araxes Pharma LLC
 In December 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Araxes, which was amended and restated in February 2015, under which we purchased all of Araxes’ patent rights in the ERK program, including KO-947 and additional backup compounds, and related intellectual property. When and if commercial sales of a product candidate covered by the purchased patent rights begin, we are obligated to pay Araxes tiered royalties of low single digit percentages of our net sales, depending on the amount of our net sales with standard provisions for royalty offsets. We are also required to make development and regulatory milestone payments to Araxes of up to $9.7 million in the aggregate if specified development events and regulatory approvals are achieved. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, in December 2014 we issued 
 
15


a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $0.5 million to Araxes, which automatically converted into shares of common stock in our March 2015 private placement.


16


The University of Michigan
 In December 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Michigan, which was amended in March 2015, July 2015, September 2016 and February 2017, under which we received certain license rights for a non-refundable upfront license, annual maintenance fees and payments upon achievement of certain development and sales-based milestones. The licensed asset consists of several compounds, which are in the lead discovery/lead optimization phase. All future development, regulatory and commercial work on the asset will be completed fully and at our sole expense. The University of Michigan retains the right to use the asset for non-commercial research, internal and/or educational purposes, with the right to grant the same limited rights to other non-profit research institutions. Furthermore, the agreement stipulates contingent consideration for the issuance of shares equivalent to a set dollar value upon the occurrence of a qualified financing or a change of control event, as defined in the amendment to the agreement, consistent with the terms issued to any future investors or the per share consideration to be received by other shareholders. As a result of our March 2015 private placement, we issued to the University of Michigan 79,113 shares of our common stock at a fair value of $0.5 million. The agreement will terminate upon the last-to-expire patent rights, or may be terminated by us at any time with 90 days written notice of termination or terminated by the University of Michigan upon a bankruptcy by us, payment failure by us that is not cured within 30 days or a material 
breach of the agreement by us that is not cured within 60 days.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses were $20.4 million and $17.8 million, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Part II – Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities.
Competition
 The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Although we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly, or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
17


Tipifarnib Competition
 Although there are currently no approved drugs targeting farnesyl transferase, we are aware of several compounds that are now or have previously been in clinical development, including Merck’s lonafarnib, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMS-214662, Astellas Pharma’s (formerly OSI) CP-609,754, and AstraZeneca’s AZD3409. To our knowledge, there are no ongoing clinical trials evaluating any of these agents for the treatment of cancer. However, the initiation of clinical development of another of these agents in an oncology setting could become competitively significant, and if tipifarnib or our other product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 Even if we are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in the targeted therapeutic indications of PTCL and MDS. Competitive drugs currently approved for PTCL include belinostat (Beleodaq®) and pralatrexate (Folotyn®), marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, romidepsin (Istodax®), marketed by Celgene, and brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris®) (for ALCL), marketed by Seattle Genetics. Competitive drugs currently approved for MDS include azacytidine (Vidaza®) and lenalidomide (Revlimid®), marketed by Celgene, and decitabine (Dacogen®) marketed by Otsuka and Johnson & Johnson. Although there are currently no drugs approved specifically for the treatment of HRAS-mutant solid tumors, there are several targeted therapies approved for the treatment of SCCHN including Eli Lilly’s/Merck KGaA’s cetuximab (Erbitux®), Bristol Myers Squibb’s nivolumab (Opdivo®) and Merck’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), and thyroid cancer, including AstraZeneca’s vandetanib (Caprelsa®), Bayer’s sorafenib (Nexavar®), Exelixis’ cabozantinib (Cometriq®) and Eisai’s lenvatinib (Lenvima®). There are no targeted therapies approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer or CMML.
 ERK Inhibitor Competition
 While there are currently no approved drugs targeting ERK, we are aware of several compounds that are in clinical development, including Roche/Genentech’s ravoxertinib (RG-7842/GDC-0994) BioMed Valley Discoveries’ ulixertinib (BVD-523), Eli Lilly’s LY-3214996, Merck’s MK-8353 and Novartis’ LTT-462. Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or preclinical development of compounds targeting ERK. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve clinical activity, regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our compounds, constraining the ability of our compounds to gain significant market share. Although we believe that KO-947 presents several potential advantages relative to these aforementioned candidates, including potency, prolonged pathway inhibition and the ability to be administered as an intravenous infusion, these results may not translate to superior therapeutic benefit in clinical trials.
Menin-MLL Inhibitor Competition
 There are no drugs, to our knowledge, approved or in clinical trials targeting the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction. Although there are no targeted therapies approved specifically for the treatment of MLL-r leukemias, there are several products in clinical development, including Epizyme’s EPZ-5676 and Novartis’s midostaurin, as well as Pfizer’s palbociclib (IBRANCE®), which has received accelerated approval in combination with letrozole, for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer as initial endocrine-based therapy for their metastatic disease.
Commercialization
 We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in discovery, preclinical or early clinical development. We anticipate that we will aim to retain commercial rights in North America for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We may also seek to retain commercial rights in Europe for any of our product candidates for which we may in the future receive marketing approvals. We currently anticipate that, if and when appropriate, we will seek to access the North American or European oncology markets through a focused, specialized, internal sales force.
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused internal sales and marketing team in North America to sell our products. We may also build a focused internal sales and marketing team in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an approach will enable us to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our current product candidates are being developed. Outside of regions where we maintain commercial rights, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions.
 
18


We also aim to build a marketing and sales management force to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we may in the future market through our own sales teams and to oversee and support our sales force. We anticipate that our goals for any such marketing force include developing educational initiatives with respect to any approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.
 We currently expect that any third parties with which we may collaborate in the future on the development of any commercial companion diagnostics for use with our therapeutic products will most likely hold the commercial rights to those diagnostic products. We expect that we would coordinate closely with any future diagnostic collaborators in connection with the marketing and sale of such diagnostic products and our related therapeutic products.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. Under our license agreement with Janssen, Janssen has provided us with its existing inventory of clinical supply of tipifarnib, which we believe will support our ongoing and planned Phase 2 clinical trials of tipifarnib. Janssen also provided us with its existing inventory of the crude drug substance and bulk key intermediate for manufacture of drug substance for tipifarnib. If needed, we aim to engage, by entering into a supply agreement or through another arrangement, third party manufacturers to provide us with additional tipifarnib clinical supply. For all our product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA.
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we or our collaborators may develop.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies, including novel biomarker and diagnostic discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties.
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file or license patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding composition-of-matter of these product candidates, as well as biomarkers that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for use of any of our product candidates, formulations, processes and methods of using these product candidates in the treatment of various cancers. We own or in-license a patent portfolio consisting of over 30 patent families, including issued U.S. patents and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, pending U.S. patent applications, pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We have exclusively licensed from Janssen a portfolio of approximately 20 patent families. The in-licensed Janssen composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents expired in the United States and Europe in 2016. We have also exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center a patent family pertaining to a method of use of tipifarnib. We have exclusively licensed from the University of Michigan or co-own multiple families of patent applications pertaining to our menin-MLL program. Other patent applications we own include composition-of-matter and method-of-use applications covering KO-947. We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file for patents in the United States with counterparts in major market countries in Europe and other key markets in the rest of the world. 
 In addition to the patent applications that we have filed to date, we plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional inhibitor compounds of oncology molecular targets and their derivatives. Specifically, we anticipate that we will seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds, their intermediates and/or metabolites, the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies and the use of biomarkers for patient selection for these compounds. However, these or other patent applications that we may 
 
19


file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents, and any issued patents may cover limited claims that reduce their value and/or may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In addition to patents, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party.
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 If the NDA holder for the reference drug and/or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of an NDA for a listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon FDA approval of an NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that the FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. Five-year NCE exclusivity does not block the submission, review or approval of a 505(b)(1) NDA.
 Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND application and NDA submission—plus all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term, including the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of NDA approval.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and 
 
20


Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
 FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a specific indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter clinical trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on 
 
21


mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the fees are typically increased annually.
 FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 12 months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP—a quality system regulating manufacturing—is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, for FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the 
 
22


filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Under the Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by FDA.
 If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.
 Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee waivers, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or 
 
23


disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested prior to submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. This policy is described in an August 2014 FDA guidance document.
 FDA has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a premarket approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. We believe that FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments 
 
24


involves coordination of review by FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by FDA. FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals.
 Clinical Trials and IDEs
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device.
 All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients pursuant to FDA regulations, the FDA must approve an IDE application prior to initiation of investigational use. IVD trials usually do not require an IDE, as the FDA does not judge them to be a significant risk because the results do not affect the patients in the study. However, for a clinical trial where the IVD result directs the therapeutic care of patients with cancer, we believe that the FDA may consider the investigation to present significant risk and require an IDE application.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients. A non-significant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. Both significant risk and non-significant risk investigational devices require approval from IRBs at the study centers where the device will be used.
 During the critical trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and 
 
25


record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with applicable requirements.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
 Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws, which generally will not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include transparency laws, anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and regulation regarding providing drug samples, among others.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties, including the False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information used and disclosed by covered entities and their business associates that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Many states and foreign jurisdictions also have laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, and such laws often vary from one another and from HIPAA.
 
26


The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and certain manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Our activities may also be certain state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information that may not be preempted by HIPAA, as well as additional tracking and reporting obligations regarding payments to healthcare providers and marketing expenditures.
 Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations
 In addition to regulatory schemes that apply, or may in the future apply, to our business, we are or may become subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, laboratory procedures and any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development activities. We do not presently expect such environmental, health and safety laws or regulations to materially impact our present or planned future activities.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any of our product candidates that may be approved will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of the product will be covered by third party payors. Third party payors may limit coverage to an approved list of products, or formulary, which might not include all drug products approved by the FDA for an indication. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by third party payors, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in the future to demonstrate the medical necessity and/or cost effectiveness of any such product. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown increased interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Continued interest in and adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates we are developing.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access.

United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a specific focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner by which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
 In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates.
