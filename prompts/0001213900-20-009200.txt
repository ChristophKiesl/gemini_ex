Item 1. Business
Overview
 
HyreCar Inc. was formed as a corporation in the State of Delaware on November 24, 2014. Our founders identified the need for a car-sharing platform for individuals who wanted to drive for ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. (“Uber”) and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), but whose automobiles could not meet the standards imposed by the ride-sharing companies. For example, Uber maintains strict guidelines regarding the types of cars a driver can use. Although guidelines relating to cars can differ by state, in general the use of two door coupes, motorcycles and cars that are 12 years or older are excluded. Our founders, before deciding to purchase qualifying sedans that met Uber’s strict guidelines, first inquired as to whether there were any rental options available from Uber that would allow them to drive for the ride-sharing platform. To their surprise, there were no rental options available, other than a shadow industry of individuals renting cars to one another.
 
HyreCar is a car-sharing marketplace that allows car owners (collectively, “Owners”) to rent their idle cars to ride-sharing service drivers (collectively, “Drivers”). By sourcing vehicles from individual Owners, part-time Drivers may easily enter and exit the market and our business model allows us to satisfy fluctuating transportation demand in cities around the United States by matching Owners and Drivers. In 2019 we began to diversify our vehicle supply to include commercial owners of vehicles including car dealerships and fleet owners, which has helped us to increase our activity levels later in the year, and now commercial vehicles account for more than three-quarters of the rental days on our platform.
 
Our business is based on a proprietary car-sharing marketplace developed to (i) onboard Owners and Drivers, (ii) facilitate the matching of Owners and Drivers and (iii) log rental activity for Owners and Drivers. All transactions related to the rental (including, but not limited to, background checks, rentals, deposits and insurance costs) are run securely through the HyreCar platform. Drivers and Owners access their rental or car dashboards through a unique login. Drivers can easily initiate, terminate or extend a rental through the platform while Owners can manage their car or fleet of cars through the platform.
 
We believe we have a competitive advantage with our commercial automobile insurance policy that covers both Owners and Drivers. The policy is specifically designed to cover the period of time in which a Driver is operating an Owner’s vehicle while not actively operating a vehicle on a ride-sharing platform, such as Uber or Lyft. During the periods when Drivers are actively operating on a ride-sharing platform, the insurance subordinates to the state mandated insurance provided by the ride-sharing business. To our knowledge, we are the only provider of this car-matching service which is made possible by this unique insurance product.
 
To date, the majority of our growth has been from the dealer sales efforts to build sustainable vehicle supply focused on key markets through the United States. Our car supply has changed from mostly individuals which is where we started to now more the three quarters of our car supply and rental days coming from the commercial side of the business – consisting primarily of dealers and large fleet owners. We have seen a particular emphasis on states in the southern portion of the United States in late 2019, and now the majority of our daily rental days come from a handful of states in the Southern United States including California, Georgia, Maryland and Texas. We have also increased driver leads matched in those same kay markets, which has been achieved through organic search traffic and paid search advertising. Going forward we will direct advertising dollars strategically because we believe that online channels and offline brand awareness will provide substantial opportunities for growth.

Industry and Market Opportunities
 
Our company was founded to capitalize on a combination of two growth markets: ridesharing (an industry led by Uber and Lyft) and car-sharing (an industry led by companies such as Turo, Inc. and ZipCar, Inc.). Our customers are the Drivers that use our car-sharing platform to rent a car and then use that car to make money driving for either Uber or Lyft. Finding enough cars and drivers to meet demand has been a problem for ride-sharing companies. Recently we have expanded our business to add additional delivery services with companies like Instacart and Postmates,
 
The transportation industry represents a massive market. In the United States alone, consumer expenditures on transportation were approximately $1.3 trillion in 2019, and transportation was the second largest household expenditure after housing and was almost twice as large as healthcare and three times as large as entertainment. We believe we are still in the very early phases of capturing this massive opportunity. In 2019, ridesharing accounted for just seven percent of total vehicle miles travelled in the United States and in a 2016 survey, 57% of U.S. respondents who used sharing services said that well-priced and convenient offerings could cause them to give up ownership altogether.
 
We have added over 25,000 Drivers, matching them with Owner vehicles that have been used on the Uber and Lyft platforms over the past several years. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we added approximately 11,000 and 7,000 new Drivers, respectively, into cars so that they could drive for Uber and Lyft. These numbers represent an equivalent 157.1% growth rate in new drivers onto the HyreCar platform year over year.
 
Ride-sharing Industry (Uber and Lyft)
 
The growth in ridesharing over the past few years has kicked off a transportation revolution. Smart phones are now used as ride hailing apps, transactions are processed seamlessly through online platforms and transportation as a service is becoming more and more personalized. The industry has experienced tremendous traction. According to a July 2016 post on TechCrunch, it took Uber six years, to December 2015, to complete a billion rides and by the end of 2019, Uber announced that it had completed its two-billionth ride.
 
Transportation Network Companies (“TNCs”) like Uber and Lyft have reported high demand from Drivers but many of these Drivers do not own a car that qualifies for their platforms. Uber reported that it had 3.9 million drivers and Lyft reported that it had 1.9 million drivers in North America at the end of 2018. In 2016, a spokesperson for Uber estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of their potential drivers/partners do not own a qualifying car. Further, Lyft estimates that there are approximately 60,000 people in the city of Chicago alone that want to drive for their platform, but do not currently own a qualifying car, and General Motors also estimates that there are approximately 160,000 potential drivers in the DC Metro area, Baltimore, Chicago and Boston who do not own a qualifying car.
 
Accordingly, TNCs are actively taking steps to satisfy their driver demand by setting up programs designed to get eligible drivers into qualified cars, including such programs as the Enterprise/Uber partnership, the Lyft Express Driver partnership with Hertz and Pep Boys and the General Motor’s Maven program. These programs serve as a validation that there is a healthy market to pair eligible drivers with qualified cars.
 
Food and Package Industry (Instacart and Grubhub)
 
With the growth in food, package and grocery delivery services such as Uber Eats, Postmates, Grubub and Instacart, Hyrecar expects driver demand for services like HyreCar to continue into 2021. With expected revenues for all food delivery companies to top $123B in 2020 and expectations to increase to $164B by 2024. Drivers participating into the Gig economy are diversifying their sources of income across many different TNCs and delivery services. Over 61% of all HyreCar drivers are active drivers for both rideshare and delivery service companies. The package and food delivery companies have seen tremendous demand in the first quarter of 2020, and expect continued growth into 2021 as more and more households move away from traditional in store purchase to online and mobile purchases for the same goods.
Car-sharing Industry
 
Shared mobility market began to rapidly develop around 2010-2011 when the total number of its users exceeded one million. In 2017, there were already around 10 million people using this type of service, and according to a study by Frost & Sullivan, by 2025 their numbers will reach 36 million, maintaining the annual growth rate of 16.4%. Global Market Insights forecasts the value of the global car sharing market in 2024 at $11 billion. At present, the leading shared mobility markets are the U.S. and Western Europe, while experts predict that Asia will experience the fastest growth in this field. HyreCar will be able to capitalize on this opportunity as existing demand from traditional taxi and public transportation options is transferred to shared transportation. Further, growth is expected from this opportunity as the accelerating trend of the mass ease-of-use and availability of shared transportation permanently shifts driving habits away from personal vehicle ownership. Evidence of this decline, while not yet a national trend, can be seen in large cities as vehicle ownership is beginning to decline. Longer term, we envision a potential impact on the auto industry as a whole from a subset of people permanently changing their driving habits and selling their cars entirely in favor of using shared transportation.

Competition
 
The key differentiator between HyreCar and our competitors is our asset light model, which allows us to connect excess car inventory to drivers without actually owning or managing the vehicles. This allows our prices to be competitive with other vehicle solutions because we do not have the monthly vehicle overhead or infrastructure costs that our competitors may have. Other advantages include the following:

1. | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers using our platform are not locked into lengthy lease agreements, monthly contracts or subscription fees. Our payment model is upfront and transparent. While our competitors engage in auto-debiting payment for the rented vehicle from the Drivers’ accounts, regardless of their current account balance, under our platform Drivers pay for the term of rental up-front, extend if they are financially able, and return the rented vehicle whenever they need with no “strings” attached. We are the only company providing this type of fluid and frictionless car transaction for Uber and Lyft drivers. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Convenience: In some cases, drivers are renting a car from their neighbors. They walk down the street, take the keys and go. With Hertz, FlexDrive, Fair or Avis, only one or two retail outlets participate in the Uber and Lyft programs. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Fungibility: For most of HyreCar’s drivers, the ability to use the same car for rideshare and food delivery is an important reason why they choose our platform. Coupled with a comprehensive protection program that includes insurance and other services, drivers are attracted to this unique service not offered by our competition.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Among vehicle solutions for ride-sharing rentals, there are Hertz, FlexDrive, Fair, Avis and HyreCar. These car rental companies are similar in one way: they operate in the U.S. and provide cars drivers to rent and drive on the Uber or Lyft platform. However, their business models vary widely.
 
Fair.com (“Fair”) was a very strong competitor starting in mid-2019 after it entered into a vehicle supply partnership with Uber, following Uber’s spring 2019 Initial Public Offering. Fair was offering promotional weekly rates to Uber drivers which presented a competitive threat in certain marketing, particularly in California. The partnership came to an end in February 2020 when Uber announced it was ending this “Fair Go” partnership, and as a result Fair has exited the weekly rental business and began repossessing cars from more than 10,000 drivers mostly in the state of California in March 2020.

Our Strengths
 
Using our website platform or mobile applications (iOS and Android), vehicle Owners can post their cars to our marketplace and Drivers can browse car inventory prior to rental. Once a Driver finds a car, he or she creates a profile, enters his or her personal information and credentials (including, address, city, state, a copy of applicable state issued driver’s license, Uber or Lyft credentials and social security number) and submits a credit card for payment. We then perform a criminal background check, DMV driving record check, Homeland Security Watch-list and Sex Offender database check. HyreCar’s screening criteria is stricter than Uber and Lyft’s background check and we are focused on maintaining a safe user experience and ensuring that all transactions between owners and drivers are processed through a secure web platform. The attraction and vetting of qualified gig economy drivers is a primary reason why commercial automobile businesses around the country are increasingly working with the Company.
Why Drivers Use Our Service
 

● | Attractive Market: Drivers’ ability to earn income by driving for a ride-sharing business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers are not locked into long-term lease agreements, long-term monthly payments or subscription fees. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenience: Drivers can pick up the car from someone close by. Time from registration to getting behind the wheel currently averages under 48 hours. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparency and Trust: There are no hidden fees and only Owners that have been properly screened are permitted to use the platform. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Experience: Application of game-design elements (i.e. gamification) of the platform keeps Drivers engaged. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Owners Use Our Service
 
Data from a national survey of driving behavior indicates that private vehicles are in use 5% or less during any given day, or about one hour per day. Given the excess capacity of vehicle hours, higher vehicle utilization rates, and lower vehicle ownership rates, we expect a consumer shift towards acceptance of car-sharing. Based on the results of the survey, we believe our platform is advantageous for the following reasons:

● | Passive Income: We often match Owners with long term Drivers, which provides the Owners with a steady source of passive income resulting from our seamless re-booking process. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance: Liability policy fills the gaps left by personal and ride-sharing policies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Review of Drivers: Drivers must pass our extensive background checks and most Drivers have also passed the Uber and Lyft background checks. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance Coverage
 
A key component to our business is our commercial auto insurance coverage. The two-sided nature of our platform means that we need to insure both the Driver and the Owner. Prior to any rental the Driver and Owner are provided an insurance ID card that lists the driver’s name and the vehicle identification number. Insurance is typically generated twenty-four hours in advance of the commencement of the rental through to when the Owner confirms drop-off of the rented vehicle by the Driver. The vehicle pick-up and drop-off is all managed through our platform. An Owner takes pictures of his or her vehicle prior to pressing the “Confirm Pick-up” button on the HyreCar mobile app. (If pictures are not taken and the button is not pressed, it provides grounds for a claim denial; subsequent liability and/or physical damage rests solely on the Driver and Owner.) After the rental is completed, the Owner presses the “Confirm Drop-off” button on the HyreCar mobile app and the rental ends.

American Business Insurance Services (“ABI”) is our insurance broker and YRisk is our mobility-focused managing general underwriter, YRisk was sold by our incumbent insurance company American International Group (NYSE: AIG) to The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) in December 2018 and is currently a subsidiary of HIG. We moved our annual car insurance policy to The Hartford for the plan year from April 2019 to May 2020 under superior pricing and terms. ABI handles all of our back-end insurance generation and processing through an API connection with HyreCar databases. ABI is a top broker in the United States for the Taxi and Livery business. Mr. David Haley, president of ABI, sits on our strategic advisory board.
 
For insurance purposes a vehicle rental is broken into four distinct driving periods. Period 0 is when the Driver has picked a vehicle up from the Owner and is driving with the Uber or Lyft app turned-off. Period 1 is when the Driver has the Uber or Lyft app turned-on but has not yet accepted a fare. Period 2 is when the Driver has accepted a fare and is on the way to pick-up a passenger. Period 3 is when a passenger is in the vehicle. The HyreCar policy is specifically written to cover periods in which the Drivers are operating HyreCar vehicles OFF the Uber or Lyft platform (period 0). During the periods when Drivers are operating ON the Uber or Lyft platform (periods 1, 2 and 3), the HyreCar insurance subordinates to state mandated insurance provided by Uber and Lyft. This enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state mandated insurance policies provided by the TNCs.
 
Business Structure and Strategy
 
We operate out of our corporate office in Los Angeles, California. Our technology platform allows for a relatively small staff compared to the size and reach of our business. For example, our platform matches drivers and owners in all 50 U.S. States and the District of Columbia with no physical presence in those states, with the exception of California. Our business structure is divided into three distinct departments: General and Administrative, Sales and Marketing and Research and Development.
 
Sales and Marketing are vital to our future profitability and growth. Most of our customers need to be sold into a car because they are initially reluctant to pay upfront fees. Early interactions with our customers indicated that if customers were walked through the process once by a member of our sales and marketing team, the customers were more inclined to use and continue to use our services for a longer period of time.
 
We have expanded the sales team to a total of 42 employees, including 3 managers, which are divided into a Driver team and an Owner team. The Driver team has a total of 16 sales agents and Driver team members make a large volume of calls a day to new customer leads with a mandate to facilitate drivers into cars via the HyreCar platform. The Owner team has a total of 14 sales agents split evenly into the following three regions: west coast states, central states and east coast states. The Owner sales team’s primary objective is to get Owners to list their cars on the HyreCar platform. As the sales team has become more efficient as we have scaled, we don’t expect the need to add headcount as rapidly through 2020 in order for us to continue to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates.
 
Leveraging headcount more efficiently is a key assumption that we believe drives profitability. The ability to grow topline revenue without significant increases to operating expense is achieved through a combination of marketing, sales, support and technology. Attribution of organic bookings is directly related to the quality of marketing leads generated and user interface/experience enhancements (UI/UX) per technology development. HyreCar has invested in a partnership with a leading SEO firm to continue maximizing organic rankings on Google search pages. Additionally, new market automation tools have allowed HyreCar to communicate directly with its drivers with specially curated messaging to increase awareness of available vehicles and incentive programs for each target DMA and market segment. The company’s expectation is that both aspects contribute to low operating expense growth in relation to revenue, which in-turn, the company believes, will lead to higher gross profit in 2020.
 
We currently operate with one technology development team in the United States, including multiple full-time developers based out of our home office in Los Angeles. These teams are tasked with maintaining the current codebase and website, and incrementally adding enhancement to the Owner and Driver application and website to support our expansion into institutional car supply nationally.
 
Support and operations underpin the company. New Dealer onboarding, insurance claims management, owner payment resolutions, Driver payment resolutions, collections, chat support, email support, phone support, late rentals, car recovery, Driver verifications, insurance generation and insurance verification all work together to create what we believe is a “best in class” customer service experience. Currently, we have 14 in-house customer support staff in our Los Angeles office as well as 40 independent contractors located in the Central Time Zone through our outsourced partner who we added in mid-2019. Our plan is to focus our domestic customer support team on being client-facing for larger commercial accounts and scale by outsourcing as we continue to grow. We believe that customer service is critical to our goal of bringing new Drivers/Owners onto the platform and retaining those customers who have already utilized our services.

Revenue Model
 
We  generate revenue by taking a fee out of each rental processed on our platform. Each rental transaction represents a Driver renting a car from an Owner. Drivers pay a daily rental rate set by the Car Owner, plus a 10% HyreCar Driver Fee and direct daily insurance costs. Owners receive their daily rental rate minus a 15-25% HyreCar Owner Fee. For example, as of December 31, 2019, the average daily rental rate of a HyreCar vehicle nationally is approximately $38.00 (“Daily Rental Rate”), plus a 10% HyreCar Driver fee ($3.80) and daily direct insurance fee of $13.00, totaling $54.80 in total daily gross billings in paid by the Driver via a credit card transaction. On average approximately 80% of the daily rental or $30.40 is transferred to the Owner via our merchant processing partner. HyreCar earns revenues from the two revenue share fees and the insurance totaling approximately $24.40 per day. Accordingly, the GAAP reportable revenue recognized by HyreCar is $24.40 in this example transaction as detailed in the following table:

Daily Gross Revenue Example | Daily Net (GAAP) Revenue Example
-----------------------------------+---------------------------------
National Avenger Daily Rental Rate | $ | 38.00 | HyreCar Owner Fee (20% Avg) | $ | 7.60 
Driver Fee | $ | 3.80 | HyreCar Driver Fee (10% rate) | $ | 3.80 
Daily Insurance Fee | $ | 13.00 | Insurance Fee (100% of fee) | $ | 13.00
Daily Gross Billing Paid by Driver | $ | 54.80 | Daily Avenger Net Revenue | $ | 24.40

 
Gross billings is an important measure by which we evaluate and manage our business. We define gross billings as the amount billed to Drivers, without any adjustments for amounts paid to Owners or refunds. It is important to note that gross billings is a non-GAAP measure and as such, is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements as revenue. However, we use gross billings to asses our business growth, scale of operations and our ability to generate gross billings is strongly correlated to our ability to generate revenues. Gross billings may also be used to calculate net revenue margin, defined as the company’s GAAP reportable revenue over gross billings. Using the definition of net revenue margin and the example above, HyreCar’s net revenue margin is equal to approximately 44.3% ($15,854,924 HyreCar’s GAAP revenue over $35,819,000 Total Gross Billings). A breakout of revenue components is provided in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements.
 
Marketing Plan
 
Our marketing team periodically reviews keyword searches using Google Analytics. Thirty keywords and phrases were chosen and analyzed, allowing the team to determine in which cities the persons searching for the keywords and phrases were located. For example, approximately 400,000 people in Los Angeles googled key words like, “rent a car for Uber,” “Uber,” and “Uber Leasing.” Overlaying our customer demographics with the Google search results created a Driver/Owner affinity population of approximately 25 million potential customers, with the bulk of the 25 million concentrated in 16 core geographic locations. Our key geographies currently consist of ten key metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) based on the driver demand for ridesharing and delivery activity as part of the gig economy with large population bases. As we built out the institutional car supply through year ended December 31, 2019, our historical car supply constraints were addressed. Further, we have started focusing more locally on approximately ten key metropolitan markets primarily in the southern United States. Currently more than 75% of our car supply comes from commercial versus individual sources, with half of our rental days come from four southern states.

Insurance Opportunity
 
A large percentage of our cost of revenues is direct insurance expense, which we pay to the insurance company. The premiums are broken into two categories, liability insurance and physical damage. The unique nature of our insurance enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state mandated insurance policies provided by the Transportation Network Companies.
 
In addition to self-insurance, the company is also working with our Managing General Underwriter (“MGU”) to develop new and innovative insurance products. The company has proposed a new type of owner “lay-up” insurance and higher insurance level for fleet vehicle owners on the HyreCar platform. Lay-up insurance replaces the need for an owner’s personal auto insurance policy and would represent significant cost savings when compared to other insurance options available in the market today. Offering this type of insurance product benefits the company in multiple verticals, including reduced insurance claim expense, greater customer retention and stickiness to the HyreCar platform. Our MGU has begun piloting lay-up insurance to vehicle owners.


Regulation
 
The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) was the first state regulatory body to impose rules and guidelines for ridesharing in the United States. The CPUC designated Uber and Lyft as “transportation network companies” or TNCs. The CPUC guidelines became the standard for all states across the U.S. Most states have adopted some form of the guidelines. California is one of the strictest states when it comes to regulating the TNCs. Our insurance works within the California guidelines which make it easily adoptable by future state mandates outside of California.
 
Changes in government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices or our operational results. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Sometimes those changes may have not just prospective but also retroactive effect; this is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have either more or less impact on us than on ride-sharing businesses, depending on the circumstances. Potential changes in law or regulation that may affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, data security and rate regulation.
 
In addition, our operations also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in the fuel supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or other problem, such as the devastation caused by hurricane Harvey, affecting the petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
