ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
COMPANY HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001 under the name Altus Explorations Inc. (Altus) as a company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. The company has not been able to secure sufficient financing to act on oil and gas investment opportunities as they were identified. Therefore, we did very little business and showed very limited activity, with no profitability. In September 2010 we chose to enter the expanding field of training of peace and law enforcement officers as well as other professionals involved in the fields of security and safety oriented civilian training at both the individual and corporate levels. and entered into an agreement, in principle, to purchase Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. from UWD Unitas World Development Inc. (UNITAS), a private Canadian company. We refer to this asset purchase transaction as the Acquisition. On October 1, 2010, Altus entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Unitas. Pursuant to the Agreement, Altus issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition of 450 shares of common stock of The Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc., representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which were held by UWD. On November 4, 2010, Altus changed its name to Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. (CTTA) (the Company subsequently changed its name to Earth Life Sciences Inc. on June 2, 2014) and increased the authorized share capital from 40,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and then further from 250,000,000 to 450,000,000.
INVESTMENT IN CANADIAN TACTICAL TRAINING ACADEMY INC.

The CANADIAN TACTICAL TRAINING ACADEMY (CTTA), a wholly owned subsidiary, was an educational organization to provide professional training and operational objectives by offering the tools and guidance required to enhance careers and ensure the survival of its participants. CTTA offers specialized programs such in Executive Protection, Investigation and Surveillance, Rapid Integrated Survival Kombat (RISK) System, Tactical Firearms, Handcuffing, Airport and Airline Security (IATA and ICAO standards), Ports Facilities and Maritime Security (ISPS Code), Basic SWAT Techniques, Corporate Safety Awareness, and much more. Our civilian training programs are recognized by numerous notable corporations, and our instructors are proud members of several prestigious law enforcement and security associations.
 
The operations of CTTA started in October of 2010 and ended on December 31, 2015. Sales revenue peaked in 2013 at $75,044. The subsidiary incurred losses in every year and was unable to continue and provide professional services.
  

INVESTMENT IN WHITE CHANNEL MINERAL CLAIMS
 
On June 19, 2015, the Company entered into an option agreement (Agreement) with Song Bo, a private mineral holder, to earn a 100% beneficial interest in certain mineral concessions known as the White Channel mineral claims (the Property). Under the terms of the Agreement the Company will have the right to purchase the right, title, and interest in the Property as well as enter onto the Property to conduct reconnaissance, exploration, and development work on the Property. In exchange, the Company shall issue 225,000,000 restricted shares and pay the sum of $180,000 payable in instalments of $30,000 on the 15th of every month commencing July 15, 2015 through December 15, 2015. In addition, the Company shall pay a further $50,000 on each anniversary of the Agreement for a period of four years commencing June 19, 2016 through June 19, 2019.
 
The Property is subject to a 4% NSR on precious metals, and also subject to royalty payments of $0.25 per tonne (2206 lbs.) on the sale of pit run products or processed products; or $0.35 per tonne on the sale of processed mineral products where the selling price of the processed minerals products sell for a price in excess of $35 per metric ton; or an amount of $1.00 per tonne on the same of processed mineral products where the selling price of the processed mineral products sell for a price in excess of $100 per tonne. 50% of the NSR can purchased by the Company for $1,000,000 at any time before the fifth year anniversary of the Agreement.
 
The Property consists of the following claims located in the caribou Mining Division in the province of British Columbia:
 

Tenure | Tenure | | Map | Mining 
-------+---------+-----------+---------+---------
Number | Type | Ownership | Number | Division
399611 | Mineral | 100% | 093A024 | CARIBOO 
399044 | Mineral | 100% | 093A024 | CARIBOO 
416708 | Mineral | 100% | 093A024 | CARIBOO 

Geology – Technical
 
The local geology represents typical Cariboo complexity wit flow remnants of Miocene Basaltic age, with occasional window displaying underlying white channel clasts, being part of a much older Cariboo basement with origin to the North-East. These gravels consist of well-rounded white quartz and minor micaceous sericite clays rather loosely cemented made up of 1 cm to 10 cm of white aggregates within the clays. The East and Northeast parts of the Claim Group are covered by older Triassic volcanics, mostly grey to green Alkali Basalts, when oxidized appears red to maroon on the surface. The northern part of property was reported on by Kruchowski (1978) identifying a cohesive blue clay over and underlying the quartz gravels passing downward into well sorted and rounded coarse quartz sand. To the west, the flat-lying Miocene Flows are evident along a front of over 2 km. South to North substantial areas of white channel material are covered up. The claims have been the subject of a series of trench works to the west of China Cabin Lake. All previous testing has resulted in consistent grading of roughly 20% sericite clay matrix and 80% of a fairly uniformly graded ¾ inch quartz clasts. The trench work covers some 5 acres and displays a uniform grading to a depth of 6 metres.
Geology – General
 
The claims are an excellent footprint of industrial silica. The silica conglomerate outcrops are found on ridges to the west of China Cabin Lake. The known deposit has a spotty outcropping thought to contain at least 100,000 cubic yards of silica rich material (approx. 250,000 tonnes). This material can be used for a host of product lines including landscape rock, cement additives, silicon feed, mica, artisan clays, concrete aggregate, agricultural fillers, paint, window and bottle glass, fibre optics, porcelain and ceramics. Half a metric tonne of plus 3 inch clasts have been hand cobbed from the various trench exposures and surface outcrops across the White Channel claim. The cobbles are uniformly distributed across the south and western edges of the property. For the initial testing, 2048 grams of split samples were submitted for crushing tests. The clasts were only run through a jaw crusher and the materials screened for particle size development. In the test crushing (1 opening jaw) of the cobbles sampled from the property the following size chart was obtained:

0V0681RA | Cobble#(1-5) + 200 mesh | 390.6 | | 0.45% 
0V0681RA | Cobble#(1-5) + 400 mesh | 249.8 | | 0.29% 
0V0681RA | Cobble#(1-5) - 400 mesh | 89.9 | | 0.10%

These results indicate that only primary crushing of the product is required to obtain a host of finer products without any additional processing costs. The samples are available to be viewed at the Company offices.
 
The chart above details the weight percent of the crushing product with a clear working size of ½ inch to 10 mesh as a primary size split. The finer products will become greater as the materials is re-handled. However, each current grain size has its own industrial application.
 
Without a great deal of processing, the White Channel property offers an industrial mineral source for white decorative aggregate. The product can be mined in a fashion similar to a normal sand and gravel deposit. The main product produced from the property will be coarse grained, rounded and frosted white quartz pebbles. The product can be bulked shipped and potentially bagged on site for sale into the landscape markets in Western Canada and the west coast of the United States. The product can be either direct shipped by truck and transfer or trans-loaded at a rail siding in Williams Lake, which is 65 kilometers west of the property.
 
Location and Access
 
The property is located approximately two kilometers west of the town of Horsefly. The claim consists of 20 units or 500 hectares, with five units running north south and four units running east west. The rectangular claim block is bordered on the north by the main paved all weather regional highway running east, 51 kilometers from 150 Mile House to Horsefly. Logging road access is right to the center of the claim off the main paved road. Additional logging roads allow access to the southeast and southwest corners of the claim.
 
Elevations range roughly from 800 to 900 metres ASL with the property being slightly hilly with substantial tree cover. Four small, distinct lower boggy areas are noted across the property with streams bordering the northern and eastern edges. China Cabin Lake is wholly contained along the eastern border of the claim. The lake is fed and then emptied by a stream system running due north and south of the main lake. China Cabin Lake sits at an elevation of 827 metres ASL.
 
Heavy equipment for developing and processing the pebbles and subsequent additional minerals is readily available from Horsefly and surrounding towns such as Williams Lake. A local work force is also present.
 
The climate in the Caribou region is generally mild but can become harsh for extended periods in the winter. The operation would have to be suspended during the winter months due to the problems with equipment freeze up. Full production could be possible on the property roughly from May to November each year. The region has a large logging business and land clearing could be accomplished during the winter months when the lower elevations are frozen to allow equipment traffic. This would also facilitate trench exploration work during the non-production periods. The general positioning of the property makes it an excellent candidate to sustain a commercial extraction and production operation.
 
Facilities
 
In the center of the property is a large metal building. Approximate size is 20 feet by 65 feet. The building is suitable to house any sorting and packaging equipment that may be required to process the White Channel silica to produce a saleable product. Power and water are close by. Some improvement to the forestry roads would be required.
Economics
 
The biggest questions are connected to the availability of markets and the cost of shipping. The Company is evaluating the possibilities of shipping to the railhead in Williams Lake and the connecting shipping costs. The Company has produced some product prototypes, although the cheapest and most attractive product is simply small white architecture stone. Other products could follow a successful launch of a main product.
