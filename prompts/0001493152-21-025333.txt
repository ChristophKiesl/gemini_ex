EEG iGaming:
 
In the EEG iGaming vertical, we have a best-in-class esports betting platform with full casino and sportsbook functionality. Our in-house gambling software platform, Phoenix, is a modern reimagined sportsbook that caters to both millennial esports bettors as well as traditional sports bettors. Phoenix is being developed through the assets and resources of FLIP Sports Limited, a software development company, that we acquired in September 2020.
 
EEG’s goal is to be a leader in the large and rapidly growing sector of esports real-money wagering, offering fans the ability to wager on professional esports events in a licensed and secure environment. From February 2021, under the terms of our Maltese Gaming Authority (MGA) license, we are now able to accept wagers from residents of over 180 jurisdictions including countries within the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, on our ‘‘Vie.bet’’ platform.
 
Alongside the Vie.bet esports focused platform, EEG owns and operates:
 

● | Argyll Entertainment’s flagship Sportnation.bet online sportsbook and casino brand, licensed in the UK and Ireland, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lucky Dino’s 5 online casino brands licensed by the MGA on its in-house built iDefix casino-platform, and 
● | The recently acquired Bethard online sportsbook and casino brands, operating under MGA, Spanish, Irish and Swedish licenses. 

 
On August 17, 2020, we announced entry into a multi-year partnership with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc, now Bally’s Corporation, to launch their proprietary mobile sports betting product, ‘‘Vie.gg’, in the state of New Jersey, as we intend to have this platform, which was previously licensed in Curacao, live in the state in prior to December 31, 2021, as a real-money wagering ‘’skin’’ of Bally’s Atlantic City, the holder of a New Jersey Casino License, Internet Gaming Permit and Sports Wagering License.

In total, we currently hold five Tier-1 gambling licenses (Malta, UK, Ireland, Spain and Sweden) and are in the process of obtaining a casino service industry enterprise (‘’CSIE’’) license in New Jersey.

Competition/Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 
The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Most of EEG’s current competitors, including Unikrn, bet365, William Hill, Betway, and Pinnacle Sports, have far greater resources than us.
 
We believe the following strengths position us for sustainable growth:

Helix LAN Center Expertise: Our Helix team prides themselves on building LAN Centers in an efficient manner and programming the centers to engage local communities. This programming (community tournaments, after-school camps, pro-team watch parties) is what drives traffic to these centers on a day-in day-out basis. Because of the team’s expertise in this area, we plan to drive further engagement through universities, theme parks and pro sports teams by building and managing centers on their properties.
 
Growth Strategy
 
In the future, we intend to:
 

● | Expand our Esports services into more of the 41 states where skill-based gambling is legal, enhance our Product offering, as well as create relationships with players that will migrate into our Vie.gg real-money wagering platform. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand our Esports Wagering services into more jurisdictions, utilizing the MGA gaming license, which provides opportunity for access into over 180 countries, as well as the recent multi-year partnership with Bally’s Corporation, to launch our proprietary mobile sports betting product in the State of New Jersey, as a real-money wagering ‘’skin’’ of Bally’s Atlantic City, the holder of a New Jersey Casino License, Internet Gaming Permit and a Sports Wagering License. In accordance with standard practice, prior to our CSIE Licensure, we will request approval from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (‘’DGE’’) to operate pursuant to a transactional waiver order. 
● | Continue with our M&A strategy in the iGaming and Traditional Sports Betting space, to acquire profitable operators in different jurisdictions, that will also allow for cross-pollination of services (Sportsbook, Casino and Esports). 

Future Products and Services:
 
Online Esports Tournament Play
 
EEG intends to offer players from around the world, including the United States, (unless prohibited in a state or international jurisdiction), the ability to enter and participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes, via our enhanced EGL Tournament platform. Online esports tournament play consists of two or more people playing against each other in a game from their personal phones or computers, where such players do not necessarily have to be playing in real time. These events could be held over the course of a day, a week or even a month and the winner will be the one with the top score or the fastest time at the conclusion of the event. Cash-based tournaments involving games of skill are not considered gambling in most U.S. states because the generally accepted definition of gambling involves three specific things: (1) the award of a prize, (2) paid-in consideration (meaning entrants pay to compete) and (3) an outcome determined on the basis of chance. As a result, games of skill are not generally subject to the same laws and regulations as our esports event wagering service. We expect participants in our tournaments being able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We anticipate collecting a tournament entry fee for our tournaments, as well as a percentage of total winnings that are paid to users (typically 10% of the entry fees) and thus none of their money will be at risk or otherwise dependent on the outcome. We intend to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in small groups to major tournaments. The tournament platform will also serve as a tool to help them determine which markets they are finding the most esports players. We believe using the tournament platform to penetrate the US market will allow us to grow our brand within the esports community and lead to lower customer-acquisition-costs for our wagering platform.

International Market Expansion
 
EEG received a Gaming Service License for online betting from the Malta Gaming Authority in April 2020, established a brick and mortar office in such jurisdiction and commenced online gaming operations in that jurisdiction in February 2021, through the Vie.gg and Argyll Brands. The Lucky Dino and Bethard brand acquisitions added additional Spanish and Swedish licenses, together with UK and Irish licenses that Argyll already operates under. In order to effectively penetrate international markets, we intend to translate our website into several additional languages and offer customer service and technical support in the local language of key markets.

Although the Vie.gg brand is focused solely on offering online wagering on the widest range of esports events broadcast from around the world, the acquisition of Lucky Dino included the acquisition of iDefix, a modern online casino platform licensed in Malta, that the Lucky Dino online casino brands operate on. iDefix provides a full technical solution for casino operations, with various management tools as well as in-depth business intelligence reporting and analysis. The Argyll and Bethard Brands offer online users traditional casino style games such as roulette, blackjack, or slots, as well as offering online wagering on traditional sporting events such as soccer, horse racing and football.
 
On the Vie.gg esports-focused wagering platform, a player can place a bet on a team participating in any number of tournaments which are scheduled to be held in the upcoming weeks. They also maintain a “how to play” section on the website which provides players with instructional videos on placing bets as well as other pieces of information that may be beneficial to an inexperienced player or a new user of our website. Additionally, we maintain a “frequently asked questions” section which provides customers with the ability to easily navigate general questions relating to the website, personal account information, payment processing, betting rules and procedures as well as tips.
 
Marketing and Sales Initiatives
 
The Company has several sponsorship marketing agreements in place for its website as well as an extended marketing agreement with Dignitas, an esports brand owned by Harris Blitzer sports and entertainment with multiple professional teams playing several titles with over a million fans worldwide.
 
EEG is looking to expand into new geographic territories by obtaining licenses to operate in those territories. The need for hands-on implementation in these territories and support will require investment in additional marketing activities, offices, and other overhead.
 
We will also accelerate our expansion if we find complementary businesses that we are able to acquire in other markets. Marketing efforts to expand into new territories have included esports team and tournament sponsorship, affiliate marketing, social media advertising, content creation, and attendance at esports and gaming events in addition to personal contact with other industry leaders.
 
We plan to increase our marketing efforts and awareness of our brands through our websites, www.vie.gg and www.sportnation.bet, as well as future offerings by:
 

● | Educating sports betting consumers to bet on esports and we want gamers to start betting on esports.

Regulations Affecting our Business
 
The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various national, federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, “gaming authorities”). Gambling laws are usually based on public policy declaration designed to protect the integrity of the gaming industry and its consumers, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism and to increase tax revenue. To accomplish these goals, gambling laws require EEG to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for EEG, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s outstanding equity unless waived as a passive institutional investor). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough and sometimes lengthy investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look, at a minimum, to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality, security and regulatory compliance of the applicant’s online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, and (iii) the history and associations of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of EEG fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, EEG may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever its relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with EEG, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis.
 
On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law that barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions and made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game. Since the Supreme Court’s decision, sports gambling has commenced in numerous states and many more states have enabling legislation pending. We plan to explore expansion of our esports online wagering platform into other US States, at the appropriate time, and seek licenses in the United States in addition to the New Jersey license
 
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIEGA”) made it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison, for a business to accept payments “in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful internet gambling.” In support of such new prohibitions, the UIGEA uses a variety of terms — some of which are ambiguous or undefined. Initially, the UIGEA broadly defines a “bet or wager” as: the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.

Further, a “bet or wager” specifically includes a chance on a lottery or prize awarded predominantly by chance; a “scheme” as defined in Title 28, U.S.C. § 3702 relating to government-sponsored amateur or professional sports betting and, “any instructions or information pertaining to the establishment or movement of funds by the bettor or customer in, to, or from, an account with the business of betting or wagering.” While this final prohibition incorporates the term “business of betting or wagering,” that term is not specifically defined anywhere in the UIGEA. The only reference to that term comes in § 5362(2), which states: The term “business of betting or wagering” does not include the activities of a financial transaction provider, or any interactive computer service or telecommunications service.
 
Nonetheless, the law does contain specific prohibitions. In order to establish a violation of the UIGEA, it must be shown that:
 

1. | A “person” was engaged in the business of betting or wagering; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | That person knowingly accepted a financial instrument or proceeds thereof; and, 
3. | That instrument was accepted (by the person) in connection with the participation of another person in “unlawful Internet gambling.” 

 
In the context of this statute “unlawful Internet gambling” is defined as follows:
 
To place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by any means which involves the use, at least in part, of the Internet where such bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal or State law in the state or tribal lands in which the bet or wager is initiated, received, or otherwise made.
 
Therefore, the UIGEA only applies to online gambling transactions that are already prohibited by other state, federal, or tribal laws. Therefore, in order for the financial transaction to be prohibited by § 5363 of the UIGEA, the bet or wager must be “initiated, received, or otherwise made” in a place where such activity (the bet of wager) violates preexisting state, federal, or tribal law.


Similarly, several other laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. As with UIEGA, these enforcement laws include the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of the UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a State or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a State or foreign country in which such betting is legal. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act. The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not limited to wagering on sporting events or contests, and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ’s new opinion. On January 20, 2021, the First Circuit reaffirmed the district court’s decision. The DOJ did not appeal to the Supreme Court. However, while a positive result, arguably the case is binding precedent only within the First Circuit, and only applies to the specific parties in the lawsuit. Accordingly, the Wire Act could still impact our ability to engage in online internet gaming in the future


At the current time, we are able to accept wagers on our vie.gg website from residents of over 149 jurisdictions including Canada, Japan, Germany and South Africa. We do not accept wagers from United States residents at this time and therefore the bet or wager on our platform is not “initiated, received, or otherwise made” in a place where such activity violates preexisting state, federal, or tribal law.
