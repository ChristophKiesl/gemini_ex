Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 Saia, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a transportation company headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia (Saia, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Saia). We provide less-than-truckload (LTL) services through a single integrated organization. While more than 97% of our revenue is derived from transporting LTL shipments, we also offer customers a wide range of other value-added services, including non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services across North America.
 Founded in 1924, Saia Motor Freight Line, LLC (Saia LTL Freight) is a leading LTL carrier that serves 44 states and provides LTL services to Canada and Mexico through relationships with third-party interline carriers. Saia LTL Freight specializes in offering its customers a range of LTL services including time-definite and expedited options. Saia LTL Freight primarily provides its customers with solutions for shipments between 100 and 10,000 pounds.
 As of December 31, 2020, Saia LTL Freight operated a network comprised of 174 owned and leased facilities, including three general offices and owned approximately 5,700 tractors and 17,400 trailers, including equipment acquired with finance leases. 
 In May 2017, Saia initiated a strategy to provide direct service to the portions of the continental United States not then serviced by the Company. The focus began with the Northeast and includes additional investments in density and service in our legacy geographies.  Since that time the Company has opened 23 new terminals.  Over the past five years, Saia has invested more than $1 billion in capital expenditures, primarily for revenue equipment, real estate and technology.  These investments have reduced the age of Saia’s fleet, improved fuel economy, reduced carbon emissions, enhanced safety and supported Saia’s plans for additional volume growth. Saia has also invested substantially in technology, training and business processes to enhance the Company’s ability to monitor and manage customer service, safety, operations and profitability.
 In 2020, Saia generated revenue of $1.8 billion and operating income of $180.3 million. In 2019, Saia generated revenue of $1.8 billion and operating income of $152.6 million. In 2020, the average Saia LTL Freight shipment weighed approximately 1,314 pounds and traveled an average distance of approximately 879 miles.
 None of our approximately 10,600 employees is represented by a union. In recent years, due to competition for quality employees, the compensation divide between union and non-union carriers has closed dramatically. However, there are still significant differences in benefit costs and work rule flexibility. In addition, non-union carriers have more work rule flexibility with respect to work schedules, routes and other similar items. Work rule flexibility is a major consideration for us as flexibility is important to meet the service levels required by customers.  We believe this provides for better communications and employee relations, stronger future growth prospects, improved efficiencies and customer service capabilities.
 Industry
 The trucking industry consists of three segments: private fleets and two “for-hire” carrier groups. The private carrier segment consists of fleets owned and operated by shippers who move their own goods. The two “for-hire” carrier groups, truckload and LTL, are defined by the typical shipment sizes handled by the transportation service companies. Truckload refers to providers generally transporting shipments greater than 10,000 pounds and LTL refers to providers generally transporting shipments less than 10,000 pounds. Saia is primarily an LTL carrier. In addition to the three main trucking segments, Saia also competes with small package carriers, final mile delivery services, railroads, air freight carriers, third party logistics providers and other emerging digital competitors.
 LTL carriers typically pickup numerous shipments, generally ranging from 100 to 10,000 pounds, consolidate them at local carrier-operated freight terminals and then transport the shipments from the terminal to the carrier-operated destination terminal for delivery to the ultimate destination. As a result, LTL carriers require expansive

networks of pickup and delivery operations around local freight terminals and linehaul operations to transport freight between the local terminals.
 The truckload segment is the largest portion of the “for-hire” truck transportation market. Truckload carriers primarily transport large shipments from origin to destination with no intermediate handling. 
 Because truckload carriers do not require an expansive network to provide point-to-point service, the overall cost structure of truckload carriers is typically lower and more variable relative to LTL carriers. However, the lack of a network subjects their drivers to extended periods away from home thus resulting in higher driver turnover and periodic driver shortages. The truckload segment is comprised of several major carriers and numerous small entrepreneurial players. At the most basic level, a truckload company can be started with capital for rolling stock (a tractor and a trailer), insurance, a driver and little else. As size becomes a factor, capital is needed for technology, infrastructure and some limited facilities. Saia LTL Freight may participate in the truckload market as a means to fill empty miles in lanes that are not at capacity. Saia also offers its customers the truckload and expedited offerings of its non-asset operations.
 Capital requirements are significantly higher in the traditional LTL segment versus the truckload segment. In the LTL sector, substantial amounts of capital are required for a network of freight terminals, shipment handling equipment and revenue equipment (both for city pick-up, delivery and linehaul). In addition, investment in technology has become increasingly important in the LTL segment largely due to the number of transactions and number of customers served on a daily basis. Saia LTL Freight picks up approximately 29,000 shipments per day, each of which has a shipper and consignee, and sometimes a third-party payor, all of whom need access to information in a timely manner. More importantly, technology plays a key role in improving customer service, operations efficiency and compliance, safety and yield management. As a result of the significant infrastructure required to operate an LTL carrier, the LTL segment is more concentrated than the truckload segment with the largest LTL players operating nationally or in regional markets. Driver turnover in the LTL sector is significantly lower relative to the truckload sector, although LTL carriers also face periodic driver shortages.
 Business Strategy
 Saia has grown historically through a combination of organic growth and geographic integration or “tuck-in” acquisitions of smaller trucking and logistics companies. More recently Saia has grown largely through organic growth.
 Key elements of our business strategy include:
 Continue to focus on operating safely.
 Our most valuable resource is our employees. It is a corporate priority to continuously emphasize the importance of safe operations to reduce both the frequency and severity of injuries and accidents. This emphasis on safe operations is focused not only on protecting our employees and the communities in which we operate, but with the continued escalation of commercial insurance and healthcare costs, it is important to maintain and improve stockholder returns. Operational safety has a broader impact on the communities we serve and we expect regulatory requirements to become an increasing priority.

Manage yields and business mix.
 This element of our business strategy involves managing both the price we charge for our services and the mix of freight we transport to operate our network more profitably. Improvements in the economy coupled with the tightening of available capacity in the industry over the last several years allowed the Company to implement pricing initiatives to increase the Company’s yield and revenue per shipment.
 Increase density in existing geographies.
 We gain operating leverage by growing volume and density within existing geography. Depending on pricing and the specific lanes, we estimate that the potential incremental profitability on growth in current markets can be as much as 20 percent or more. This improves margins, asset turnover and return on capital. We actively monitor opportunities to add freight terminals where there is sufficient market potential. Future volume growth at Saia could result from improvements in the general economy, industry consolidation, geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions, as well as specific sales and marketing initiatives.
 Continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service.
 The foundation of Saia’s growth strategy is consistent delivery of high-quality service through on-time delivery and reduced claims for lost and damaged freight. Commitment to service quality is valued by customers and allows us to charge fair compensation for our services and positions us to improve market share.
 Continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies.
 Saia has operating initiatives focused on continuing to improve efficiency, including by optimizing our linehaul scheduling and pick-up and delivery operations. These initiatives help offset a variety of structural cost increases like wages, healthcare benefits, casualty insurance, workers’ compensation claims and casualty claims and parts and maintenance expense. Optimizing our linehaul scheduling and pick-up and delivery operations provides the opportunity to better utilize assets and thus reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. We believe Saia continues to be well positioned to manage costs and utilize assets. We believe we will continue to see new opportunities for cost savings.
 Prepare the organization for growth and expand geographic footprint.
 While our immediate priority is to improve profitability in our existing geography, we plan to further pursue geographic expansion and build additional density in legacy markets to promote profitable growth and improve our customer value proposition over time. As a result, we plan to continue to invest in new terminals, in our tractor and trailer fleet and in new technology to enable us to efficiently handle the increased freight flows we anticipate to and from new and existing markets.  In addition to direct expansion through adding new terminals, management may consider acquisitions from time to time to help expand geographic reach and density while gaining the business base of the acquired entity.
 Continue to address environmental and social issues.
 We are dedicated to building on our strong, positive culture by being a leading corporate citizen for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and shareholders. In recent years, we have invested heavily in our tractor and trailer fleet to improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, while also improving reliability and lowering maintenance expenses.  We are also working to optimize our linehaul scheduling and pick-up and delivery operations to better utilize our assets and thus further reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions.  We are undertaking pilot programs involving the use of alternative fuels for our operations, including testing of tractors powered by compressed natural gas and electricity.  The Company has implemented new procedures designed to reduce the risk of spills of hazardous materials we transport and to quickly and efficiently react to any environmental incidents.  At our terminals, we have implemented electricity-saving procedures and have conservation initiatives in place to recycle used oil, scrap metal, paper and cardboard.  Additionally, for new construction terminals we are using best practices of including green initiatives where possible.

We are focused on maintaining strong relationships with our employees.  We invest in our employees through training and professional development programs, safety training, wellness programs, internal employee communications and employee recognition programs, along with providing competitive wages and employee benefit programs.  We have recently added a Vice President in charge of promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of our organization and have created a Diversity Council to foster a diverse workforce and promote a culture of respect for all employees.  As part of the upgrade of our tractor fleet, we have added accident avoidance technology in our new over-the-road tractors, including active braking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning systems and roll stability control, designed to make our drivers safer and to protect the communities where we operate.
 Seasonality
 Our revenues are subject to seasonal variations. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher as a percent of revenue in the winter months primarily due to lower capacity utilization and weather effects. Generally, the first quarter is the weakest quarter while the second and third quarters are the strongest quarters in terms of revenue and profit. Quarterly profitability is also impacted by the timing of salary and wage increases and general rate increases which have varied over the years.
Human Capital
 We believe our success as a company depends on the strength of our workforce.  Our Vice President of Safety and Human Resources, reporting to our President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy.  This includes recruiting, hiring, training and retention as well as the development of our compensation and benefits programs.  
 Our 10,600 union-free employees are comprised of about 52% licensed commercial drivers, about 23% dock workers (approximately one-third of whom are part-time) and the remaining 25% work in sales, technology and administration to support our business.  Of Saia’s workforce, approximately 90% are male.  Approximately 48% of all employees have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races. Additionally, nearly 80% of our workforce is under the age of 55, while our driver average tenure is almost nine years.
 As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, we offer benefits that support their physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to affordable and convenient medical programs intended to meet their physical and emotional needs and the needs of their families, with 97% of employees participating.  To foster retention, employees with ten or more years of service do not pay premiums for participation in the medical program. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer eligible employees dental and vision coverage.  Additionally, Saia strives to help employees lead healthier lives through a voluntary wellness program aimed at engaging employees to promote proactive evaluation, tracking and management of major health and wellness indicators, such as blood pressure, weight, and routine blood laboratory analysis. The program has an annual participation rate of approximately 65% of our employee base. 
 As an added benefit for employees, we offer a 401(k) savings plan with a Company match as well as paid vacation and personal days. These benefits are in addition to the Company’s market-based compensation program designed to maintain competitive compensation packages for all employees. We assess the competitiveness of our compensation by principal job classifications in markets across the country through periodic compensation surveys.  Company-wide wage increases are also implemented from time-to-time, the most recent one being approximately 3.5% awarded to employees on January 1, 2021. 
 Recruiting, Hiring, Training and Professional Development.
 We seek to hire employees with the desire they spend their career with us to retirement.  With that in mind, identifying qualified candidates and attracting them with competitive compensation and benefits is key to our success.  We have regional recruiting managers across the Company to facilitate our hiring needs. If necessary and to attract the most qualified candidates, we offer periodic signing bonuses to new hires.

We have more than 300 driver trainers, who assist in providing all new drivers with over 40 hours of onboarding training. To further our drivers’ training, Saia annually trains all drivers in the Smith System defensive driving program and provides weekly safety training through various mediums, including safety videos and group and individual presentations on safety topics.  Saia’s tractor fleet is equipped with extensive safety technology, including video recording systems which enable managers to provide coaching and feedback to drivers throughout the year.   Our dock employees also receive onboarding training which is supplemented with on-going safety and job training.  Employees who express an interest in a long-term driving career can enroll in a Company-sponsored dock-to-driver program to obtain the necessary commercial driver certifications.  Annual safety awards and recognition are given to both drivers and dock employees who qualify. 
 Diversity and Inclusion.
 Saia is committed to fostering a work environment that values and promotes diversity and inclusion.  We pride ourselves in the fair treatment of our employees and strive to have a high level of employee satisfaction and productivity.  We use periodic employee engagement surveys as well as compensation surveys to measure our success in meeting our employees' needs in the workplace.
 Our Vice President of Organizational Development, Diversity & Inclusion and Talent is charged with promoting diversity across our organization and leads our efforts to foster an inclusive, empowering work environment for our employees.  We seek to promote workplace diversity and to create a spirit of inclusivity in our Company that encourages authenticity, celebrates our differences and supports collaborative effort gathered from the unique experiences and diverse perspectives of our employees.  
 In early 2021, we launched a Diversity Council offering a cross-functional employee perspective of diversity-related issues within our Company.   The goal of the leaders in our Company and of the Council is to promote a culture where individual differences are respected and all employees are valued for the skills and contributions they bring to the business.  The Council is responsible for continually examining the processes and systems in place to ensure that attraction, engagement, development and retention of a diverse workforce is encouraged by inclusive leadership principles. 
 Engagement.
 We focus on driving employee engagement throughout our organization.   We believe it is important to our success as an organization for our employees to understand how their work contributes to our overall performance.  We communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication. Saia communication starts with an employee’s manager and is supplemented by a variety of means, including regular industry updates, a monthly magazine, reports on quarterly performance directly from the CEO and executive team and annual employee engagement surveys. 
COVID-19 Response.
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, the health and safety of our employees and their families has been our top priority as we remain open for business as an essential service provider to our customers.  Our Company has established policies and procedures designed to mitigate the potential for transmission of COVID-19 amongst our employees, customers and vendors.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the form of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer have been made available to employees at all locations.  Workplaces have been configured to provide for maximum social distancing where possible and, where job functions will allow, employees have worked remotely.  New house-keeping and sanitization procedures have been implemented and, in instances where the workplace is exposed to an individual with a positive test result for COVID-19, an outside vendor is retained to do an extensive sanitization of the impacted facility.  In an effort to further the wellness of our employees and their families, the Company offered all hourly employees an additional five days of paid time off in 2020 to allow employees to take the necessary time to focus on their health or the health of their family.  Additionally, in July 2020, the Company paid virtually all employees a one-time $250 bonus.
Corporate Culture.

Saia’s mission is to safely drive our customers' success with custom solutions built on the three pillars of our service-focused values: people, purpose and performance. Our core values place the Customer First as they are the heart of the business.  Safety is a unifying fundamental behavior and practice that supports our Company’s purpose and goals.  Taking Care of Each Other is rooted in our leadership team caring for our employees and our employees caring for each other. Every employee deserves to be treated with Dignity and Respect.  Our emphasis on Do the Right Thing focuses on making the ethical choice.  Ultimately, we all seek and embrace our responsibility to the Community in which we live and operate.
 The Company has sought to adhere to our core values with a commitment to communicating with employees, providing long-term growth and by providing development opportunities and a leading and comprehensive employee compensation and benefits program. We believe this focus has fostered a positive company culture and great success with our employees and customers.
 Competition
 Although there has been some tightening of capacity and some industry consolidation, shippers continue to have a wide range of choices. We believe that service quality, price, variety of services offered, geographic coverage, responsiveness and flexibility are the important competitive differentiators.
 Saia focuses on providing LTL services in a highly competitive environment against a wide range of transportation service providers. These competitors include a small number of large, national transportation service providers in the long haul and two-day markets and a larger number of shorter-haul or regional transportation companies in the two-day and overnight markets. Saia also competes in and against several modes of transportation, including LTL, truckload and private fleets. The larger the service area, the greater the barriers to entry into the LTL trucking segment due to the need for additional equipment and freight terminals associated with this coverage. The level of technology investment required and density needed to provide adequate labor and asset utilization make larger-scale entry into the LTL market difficult. Saia also competes with small package carriers, final mile delivery services, railroads, air freight carriers, third party logistics providers and other emerging digital competitors.
 Regulation
 Over the past 40 years, the trucking industry has been substantially deregulated and rates and services are largely free of regulatory controls. Nevertheless, the trucking industry remains subject to regulation by many federal and state governmental agencies, and these authorities have broad powers over matters ranging from the authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, insurance requirements, fuel efficiency and emissions standards, and the transportation and handling of hazardous materials.
 Key areas of regulatory activity include:
 Department of Homeland Security.
 The trucking industry is working closely with government agencies to define and implement improved security processes. Federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to implement anti-terrorism measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) continues to focus on trailer security, driver identification, security clearance and border-crossing procedures. These and other safety and security measures, such as rules for transportation of hazardous materials and cargo-security regulations, could increase the cost of operations, reduce the number of qualified drivers and disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries to customers.
Department of Transportation.
 Motor carrier and freight brokerage operations are subject to safety, insurance and bonding requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and various state agencies.

Within the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has issued rules including hours of service regulations that limit the maximum number of hours a driver may be on duty between mandatory off-duty hours.  Our operations have been adjusted to comply with these rules, and while our base operations have not been materially affected, we did experience deterioration in the cost, availability and reliability of purchased transportation. Revisions to these rules could further impact our operations, further tighten the market for qualified drivers and put additional pressure on driver wages and purchased transportation costs. 
 The FMCSA’s Compliance Safety Accountability Program (CSA) could adversely affect our results and ability to maintain or grow our fleet. CSA is an enforcement and compliance model that assesses a motor carrier’s on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety and performance ratings in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicators. The evaluations are used to rank carriers and individual drivers and to select carriers for audit and other interventions.
 The FMCSA has established the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, which is a database that discloses drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers. The clearinghouse was established by the FMCSA in an effort to help better identify drivers who are prohibited from operating commercial motor vehicles based on drug and alcohol violations and ensure drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations by changing jobs or locations. The clearinghouse launched on January 6, 2020 and requires us to check for current and prospective employee’s drug and alcohol violations and annually query for violations of each driver we currently employ.
 Environmental Protection Agency.
 The EPA has issued regulations reducing sulfur content of diesel fuel and reducing engine emissions. These regulations increased the cost of replacing and maintaining trucks. Future environmental laws in this area could further increase our costs and impact our operations.
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, and costs associated with the leakage or discharge of hazardous materials we transport for our customers, among others. Although we have programs in place designed to monitor and control environmental risks and to promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable environmental laws or regulations or spills or other accidents involving hazardous substances can still occur and may subject us to cleanup costs, liabilities not covered by insurance, substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.
 Other countries have implemented laws that limit greenhouse gas emissions. If the U.S. enacted environmental laws further limiting greenhouse gas emissions, our costs could increase and our operations could be adversely impacted. The EPA and DOT have announced Fuel Efficiency Standards for medium and Heavy-Duty Trucks, which require a reduction of up to 25 percent in carbon emissions over the next decade. The EPA could also decide to further reduce nitrogen oxide emissions and to develop a NOx standard, which could impose substantial costs on us. In 2020, both the EPA and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) published proposals to further reduce engine emissions from heavy-duty engines.  The United States rejoined the Paris climate accord in 2021 and, as a result, the United States may take further action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which, could adversely affect our business. Individual states are also implementing emissions regulations, such as the CARB regulations that apply not only to California intrastate carriers, but also to carriers outside the state who own or dispatch equipment in California.

Food and Drug Administration.
 As a transportation provider of foodstuffs, we are subject to rules and regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide for the security of food and foodstuffs throughout the supply chain. The FDA has issued a final rule to establish certain requirements under the Sanitary Food and Transportation Act (SFTA) for vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training, recordkeeping and waivers. The rule is designed to promote the continuance of best practices in the industry concerning cleaning, inspection, maintenance, loading and unloading of, and operation of vehicles. Under the SFTA requirements, carriers are required to develop and implement written procedures subject to recordkeeping that specify its practices for cleaning, sanitizing, and inspecting vehicles and transportation equipment. Continued compliance with current and future SFTA requirements may cause us to incur additional expenses and affect our operations.
 Data Privacy Regulations.
 There have been increased regulatory efforts regarding data protection and transparency in how customer data is used and stored in the U.S. and other countries. For example, the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 2018, imposes strict rules on controlling and processing data originating from the EU. Other governments have enacted similar data protection laws, including the State of California’s California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and extended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. As a transportation and logistics provider, we collect and process significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. Complying with the new data protection laws may increase our compliance costs or require alterations to our data handling practices. Violations or noncompliance could result in significant fines from governmental or consumer actions and negative impacts to our reputation, operating results and financial condition.
Trademarks and Patents
 We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including Saia Guaranteed Select®, Saia Customer Service Indicators® and Saia Xtreme Guarantee®. We believe these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing strategy.
