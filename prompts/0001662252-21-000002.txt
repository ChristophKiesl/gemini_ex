Overview of key events  of the year ended September 30, 2020
 
During 2019-20, the Company continued to position its product, NovaDerm®, to enter clinical trials to gain FDA product approval. Having secured Orphan Drug Designation as a biologic for NovaDerm®, we complied with the FDA annual reporting requirements.
 
During 2020, the awareness of the risk of introducing pathogens when using materials from animals to produce drugs, devices, and biologics has increased. NovaDerm® and future Regenicin products use animal sourced materials like collagen. We have worked with our collagen supplier and the FDA to ensure we are meeting the expectations for traceability and purity of the FDA for NovaDerm® production.
 
We estimated that the completion of the IND and the clinical trials would take approximately 12-18 months and cost approximately $6.9 million once initial funding is in place. In addition to the completion of the IND, the only other significant gating item to entering the clinical trials is funding for this process.
 
Two board positions remain open anticipating requests of Board representation from potential investors.
 
Importantly, we are filing this annual report without our auditors review or audit of our financial information or this report. Our reason for doing this is simply that we cannot afford at this time to pay our auditor for past due services on prior filings or to pay the costs necessary for this current filing. Instead, we have provided herein information as typically presented in our 10K annual report, including financial information, which has not been reviewed or audited by any independent outside source.
 
We intend, if and when able, to file an amendment to this 10K filing with such audited information. We are unaware at this time when, if ever, we will obtain the necessary funding for this amended filing, but we will continue to provide such information to investors as and when we are able through either this SEC EDGAR filing process and/or through postings on our website as things change.


Our Business Moving Forward In 2021 
 
Our major objective for 2021 remains to secure the required funding to finalize some additional requirements of the IND application and begin our clinical trials. It is estimated that the cost to finalize the IND will be approximately 1.9 million dollars, and the cost to complete Phase 1/2 of the clinical trial will be approximately 5.0 million dollars. As previously reported, our goal in obtaining this funding has been to minimize shareholders' dilution as much as possible. Consequently, we are primarily pursuing financing through the issuance of a debt instrument, international licensing agreements and government grants, which have been greatly restricted to Covid-19 related grants.
 
We will continue to work with potential investors in order to pursue the necessary funding based on our stated objectives. It has taken longer to raise the funds than originally estimated; however, we remain hopeful that our goal is achievable. In the interim, the officers and related parties intend to continue to fund our essential operating costs as they have in the past; however, it should be noted that we are currently unable to fund the cost of our current year’s audit and remain behind on our obligation to pay our auditors and legal counsel for past work performed in the preparation of our securities filings.
 
In preparation of the IND application, we will continue to develop the testing suggested by the FDA during the Pre-IND meeting. Our scaffold supplier continues to introduce the FDA suggested testing on collagen processing which addresses Bovine Closed Herd requirements for the tighter safety and traceability of the collagen scaffolds used to produce NovaDerm®. Our scaffold supplier is close to entering a contract for ASTM-F2212 testing of Type I collagen. We continue discussions and evaluation of possible clinical trial sites for NovaDerm®. Our discussions have confirmed that patient recruitment and enrollment should be faster and less complicated than other clinical trials because of our Orphan Designation and the surgical protocol will be similar to the grafting procedures currently in use at those facilities. NovaDerm® should thus require minimal physician training and documentation to complete the clinical trial, when and if conducted.
 
Subject to funding, the initial trials are planned to begin with a total of ten subjects and an Initial Data Safety Monitoring Board, (DSMB), review of safety on the first three subjects once they have reached 6 months follow-up. We do not intend to interrupt our trial waiting for the DSMB report. Our management’s approach is to set up the trials so as to allow for a seamless transition into commercial production upon approval.
 
We have arranged for sufficient Bovine Closed Herd corium to produce sufficient collagen scaffolds to meet our needs for the clinical trials if they are conducted.

Our First Product Candidate NovaDerm®
 
Our first cultured skin substitute product candidate, NovaDerm®, is a multi-layered tissue-engineered living skin prepared by utilizing autologous (patient’s own) skin cells. It is a graftable cultured epithelium skin substitute containing both epidermal and dermal components with a collagen base. Clinically, we expect our Cultured Skin substitute self-to-self skin graft product will perform the same as split thickness allograft skin. Our Autologous cultured skin substitute should not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike porcine or cadaver cellular grafts. Immune system rejection is a serious concern in Xeno-transplant procedures which have a cellular component. The use of our cultured skin substitute should not require any specialized physician training because it is applied the same as in a standard split thickness allograft procedure.
 
NovaDerm® does not require the large harvest areas that are required when performing split thickness allograft procedures. NovaDerm® is designed to need only a small area of harvest material to cover the wound. Where split thickness allograft skin can be stretched 2 to 4 times, NovaDerm® can expand the coverage 100 to 400 times, greatly reducing scarring from harvesting. There are limits to how much burned area can be covered with the current split thickness allograft procedure. When a patient has more than 50% of their body with full thickness burns there is not enough harvest area available to cover the area so the same area harvested must be allowed to grow back the replacement skin before it can be harvested the second or third time, allowing to wound area open with high risk of infection and even mortality.
 
Clinically speaking, a product designed to treat a life-threatening condition must be available for the patient when needed. Our Culture skin substitute is being developed to be ready to apply to the patient when the patient is ready for grafting, within the first month of the patient being admitted to the hospital. Patients with serious burn injuries may not be in a condition to be grafted on a predefined schedule made more than a month in advance. Therefore, in order to accommodate the patient’s needs, we are striving to ensure that our cultured skin substitute will have an adequate shelf life and manufacturing schedule to ensure it is available whether the patient needs it the first month, or any day after, until the patient’s wound is completely covered and closed. We intend to provide the patient enough NovaDerm® to meet the patients’ needs in a single lot of material with adequate shelf life to be available when the patient is ready. With our extended shelf life and enough material in the first shipment the physician may perform a second grafting 5 or ten days post grafting period 1.
 
Our second product is anticipated to be TempaDerm®. TempaDerm® uses cells obtained from human donors to develop banks of cryo-preserved (frozen) cells and cultured skin substitute to provide a continuous supply of non-allogenic skin substitutes to treat much smaller wound areas on patients, such as ulcers. This product is expected to have applications in the treatment of chronic skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. This product is also expected to be similar to our burn indication product, except for the indications, and it will not depend totally on autologous cells. In fact, it may be possible to use the excess cultured skin that was originally produced for use on the patient that donated the cells used to grow the skin. Hopefully, TempaDerm® will be able to take this original cultured skin and use it on someone other than the original donor. As currently planned, TempaDerm® has the possibility of using banked cells, or even frozen cultured skin substitutes, to carry inventory to satisfy unknown needs or large volumes to meet the demands created in large scale disasters. Because of our focus to date on NovaDerm®, we have taken only limited steps toward the development of TempaDerm®. We may also decellularize TempaDerm® or NovaDerm® to make collagen wound coverings containing all the natural growth promoters found in skin.
 
We believe this technology has many different uses beyond the burn indication. The other uses may include chronic wounds, reconstructive surgery, other complex organs and tissues. Some of the individual components of our planned cultured skin substitute technology is expected to be developed for devices, such as tendon wraps made of collagen or collagen temporary coverings of large area wounds to protect the patients from infections while waiting for the permanent skin substitute. The collagen technology used for cultured skin substitutes, as designed, is expected to be used for many different applications in wound healing and stem cell technology and even drug delivery systems.
 
We could pursue any or all of the indications simultaneously if financing permitted, but for now we will seek approval for burns first as an Orphan Biologic Product to establish significant safety data and then Biological License Approval.

Competition
 
Several companies have developed or are developing products that propose to approach the markets described above. There is only one other Autologous Cultured Skin Substitute for severe burns designated as an orphan product candidate, the original Cutanogen’s PermaDerm. Recently this product was licensed by Amarantus to Emerald Organic Products.
 
We believe our products to be superior in design and function and, thus, provide significant advantages over the competitor. The advantages of our cultured skin substitute include simultaneous delivery of Autologous epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts organized with a unique collagen base, is ready for the patient in 21 to 28 days, and has a shelf life up to 2 weeks.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-85) provides that Orphan Product applications for pediatric use only, or for use in both pediatric and adult patients, that are approved on or after September 27, 2007, are assigned an annual distribution number (ADN) and may be sold for profit (subject to the upper limit of the ADN). In addition, once a product receives an Orphan BLA, the developer of the product receives up to seven years market exclusivity for a specific indication following the product’s approval by the FDA.
 
Unrestricted sales of our cultured skin substitute will require full FDA approval after data for safety and efficacy are collected from a clinical study. Once an IND is submitted, we expect enrollment and treatment to require a full one-year evaluation on each patient. The final 3 months of the evaluation is expected to be only a monitoring period. After collection of data from the clinical trial and submission to FDA, six months is typically planned for FDA’s review and comments before a decision in reached. Because of our Orphan Designation, this review time is expected to be reduced significantly.  
 
Intellectual Property
 
In 2016, we received a registered trademark for NovaDerm®.
 
We have been in contact with IP patent attorneys to determine patentability of PermaDerm IP. We will proceed with patenting PermaDerm applications, manufacturing IP when funds become available.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2020, we had 3 employees.
 
Subsidiaries
 
In September, 2013, Regenicin formed a wholly-owned subsidiary for the sole purpose of conducting research in the State of Georgia. This subsidiary has been inactive since its formation.
