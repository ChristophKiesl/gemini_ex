ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brookfield Property REIT Inc., formerly known as GGP Inc. ("BPYU" or the "Company"), and related notes, as included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). The terms "we", "us" and "our" may also be used to refer to BPYU and its subsidiaries. BPYU, a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 2010 and is an externally-managed real estate investment trust, referred to as a "REIT". BPYU is a subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ("BPY").
On July 26, 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved a series of transactions (collectively, the "BPY Transaction") pursuant to which, among other things, (i) BPY would exchange all of its shares of the Company’s common stock owned by certain affiliates of BPY and any subsidiary of the Company for shares of a newly authorized series of preferred stock of the Company designated Series B Preferred Stock (the "Class B Exchange"), (ii) the Company’s certificate of incorporation would be amended and restated to, among other things, change the Company’s name from GGP Inc. to Brookfield Property REIT Inc. and authorize the issuance of Class A Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Stock"), Class B-1 Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B-1 Stock") and Class C Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class C Stock") and to provide the terms governing such stock, and (iii) a special dividend would be paid to all holders of record of the Company’s common stock (not including holders of restricted stock, but including certain holders of options who were deemed stockholders) following the Class B Exchange (the "Pre-Closing Dividend"). The Pre-Closing Dividend would consist of a distribution of up to $23.50 in cash or a choice of either one BPY limited partnership unit ("BPY unit") or one share of Class A Stock, subject to proration in each case, based on an aggregate cash consideration amount of $9.25 billion. Each share of Class A Stock would be intended to provide an economic return equivalent to one BPY unit, and would be exchangeable for one BPY unit or its cash equivalent. The BPY Transaction was completed on August 28, 2018. All references in this report to "BPYU" or the "Company" prior to such date refer to the Company prior to the effect of the BPY Transaction.
On January 4, 2021, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ("Brookfield Asset Management" or "BAM") announced a proposal to BPY to acquire all of the limited partnership units of BPY ("BPY units") that it does not already own at a value of $16.50 per BPY unit, or $5.9 billion in total value (the "BAM Proposal"). Under the BAM Proposal, BPY unitholders would have the ability to elect to receive, per BPY unit, a combination of (i) 0.40 BAM Class A limited voting shares ("Brookfield Shares"), (ii) $16.50 in cash, and/or (iii) 0.66 of BPY preferred units with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit ("New Preferred Units"), subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum of $59.5 million Brookfield Shares (42% of the total value of BPY Units), maximum cash consideration of $2.95 billion (50% of the total value of BPY Units), and a maximum value of $500 million in New Preferred Units (8% of the total value of the Units. If unitholders collectively elect to receive in excess of $500 million in New Preferred Units, the amount of New Preferred Units can increase to a maximum of $1 billion, offset against the maximum amount of Brookfield Shares. The maximum amount of cash consideration would not be affected.
Under the BAM Proposal, holders of Class A stock would be entitled to receive the same per share consideration as BPY unitholders upon exchange of their shares into BPY units. It is also expected that the BPYU 6.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock would be redeemed at its par value of $25.00 per share in connection with the proposed transaction. The board of directors of the BPY General Partner has established a special committee to evaluate and respond to the BAM Proposal.
Our Company and Strategy
BPYU (Nasdaq: BPYU) is a subsidiary of BPY (Nasdaq: BPY; TSX: BPY.UN); one of the world’s largest commercial real estate companies, with approximately $88 billion in total assets. BPYU's Class A Stock was created as a public security that is intended to offer economic equivalence to an investment in BPY in the form of a U.S. REIT stock. BPY owns and operates iconic properties in the world’s major markets and its global portfolio includes office, retail, multifamily, logistics, hospitality, triple net lease, manufactured housing, mixed-use and student housing. 
Although BPYU only owns a subset of BPY’s portfolio, namely its Core Retail portfolio, shares of Class A Stock have been structured to provide an economic return equivalent to that of BPY units and therefore the market price of the Class A Stock will be significantly impacted by the combined business performance of BPY as a whole and the market price of the BPY units. In making an investment decision relating to BPYU’s securities, you should carefully consult the documents prepared by BPY. See "Available Information" and Item 5 "Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Insider Purchases of Equity Securities" for further information regarding BPY, including trading information with respect to BPY’s units.
BPYU directly owns a property portfolio comprised primarily of Class A retail properties (defined primarily by sales per square foot). As of December 31, 2020, we owned, either entirely or with joint venture partners, 121 retail properties located throughout the United States comprising approximately 120 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA").
Our primary objective is to be an owner and operator of best-in-class retail properties that provide an outstanding environment and experience for our communities, retailers and consumers. We aim to operate our business to achieve this objective with a long term view and will continue to make decisions with that in mind, however, we will caution that in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or "the global economic shutdown" or the "shutdown") and its impact on the global economy, we may be unable to achieve these objectives in the near term.
Our strategy includes:
•increasing the permanent occupancy of our regional mall portfolio by converting temporary leases to permanent leases and leasing vacant space;
•renewing or replacing expiring leases at greater rental rates;
•actively recycling capital through the disposition of assets, investing in whole or partial interests in high-quality regional malls, anchor pads and our development pipeline and repaying debt; and
•continuing to execute on our existing redevelopment projects and seeking additional opportunities within our portfolio for redevelopment.
As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was 92.5% leased, compared to 96.4% leased at December 31, 2019. On a suite-to-suite basis, the leases commencing in the trailing 12 months exhibited initial rents that were 1.1% higher than the final rents paid on expiring leases. 
A portion of our portfolio is owned through joint venture, partnership or other arrangements with institutional partners. Prospectively, as we recycle capital, our preference is to sell down interests in assets to institutional partners and to continue to manage the assets on behalf of ourselves and the investors. We believe that this strategy enables us to enhance returns on our capital through associated fees, which represent an important area of growth.
Our redevelopment pipeline is a significant component of value of our business. We have redevelopment activities with an estimated cost to the company totaling approximately $449.0 million in the pipeline. We continue to evaluate a number of other redevelopment projects to further enhance the quality of our assets.
Segments
BPYU operates in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation, development and management of retail and other rental properties. Our portfolio is targeted to a range of market sizes and consumer tastes. Each of our operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual property operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of a team of several members of executive management who use property operations in assessing segment operating performance. We do not distinguish or group our consolidated operations based on geography, size or type for purposes of making property operating decisions. Our operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to our tenants. There are no individual operating segments that are greater than 10% of combined revenue or combined assets. When assessing segment operating performance, certain non-cash and non-comparable items such as straight-line rent, depreciation expense and intangible asset and liability amortization, are excluded from property operations, which are a result of our emergence, acquisition accounting and other capital contribution or restructuring events. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than 10% of consolidated revenues. As a result, the Company's operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest tenant, L Brands, Inc. (based on common parent ownership), accounted for approximately 4.1% of rents. Our three largest tenants, L Brands, Inc., Foot Locker, Inc., and LVMH, in aggregate, comprised approximately 10.1% of rents.
Competition
Competition within the retail property sector is strong. We compete for tenants and visitors to our malls with other malls in close proximity as well as online retailers. We believe the high-quality of our properties enables us to compete effectively for retailers and consumers. In order to maintain and increase our competitive position within a marketplace we:
•strategically locate tenants within each property to achieve a merchandising strategy that promotes traffic, cross-shopping and maximizes sales;
•introduce new concepts to the property which may include restaurants, theaters, grocery stores, first-to-market retailers, and e-commerce retailers;
•utilize our properties with the opportunities to add other potential uses such as residential, hospitality and office space to complement our retail experience;
•invest capital to provide the right environment for our tenants and consumers, including aesthetic, technological, and infrastructure improvements; and
•ensure our properties are clean, secure and comfortable.
Governmental Regulations 
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on the Company's business, including its capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. The Company incurs costs to monitor, and takes actions to comply with, governmental regulations that are applicable to its business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related laws and regulations.
See “Item 1A - Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to the Company, including, to the extent material, to its competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” together with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon its capital expenditures and earnings.
Seasonality
Although BPYU has a year-long temporary leasing program, occupancies for short-term tenants and, therefore, rental income recognized, are higher during the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, the majority of our tenants have December or January lease years for purposes of calculating annual overage rent amounts. Accordingly, overage rent thresholds are most commonly achieved in the fourth quarter. As a result, revenue production is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year.
Human Capital
While certain of our subsidiaries have employees, BPYU does not have any employees. BPYU has entered into a Master Services Agreement dated August 27, 2018, among Brookfield Asset Management, the Company and certain other parties thereto (the "Master Services Agreement") pursuant to which each service provider and certain other affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management provide, or arrange for other service providers to provide, day-to-day management and administrative services for our Company. See Exhibit 10.16 for this Master Service Agreement.
Insurance
BPYU has comprehensive liability, property and rental loss insurance with respect to our portfolio of properties. We believe that such insurance provides adequate coverage.
See Item 1A - "Risk Factors" for additional discussion of insurance matters.
Qualification as a REIT
BPYU intends to maintain REIT status, and therefore our operations generally will not be subject to federal income tax on real estate investment trust taxable income. A schedule detailing the taxability of dividends for 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been presented in Note 8.
