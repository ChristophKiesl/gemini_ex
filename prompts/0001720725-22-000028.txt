ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Oyster Point Pharma, Inc. (the Company) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class pharmaceutical therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases. On October 15, 2021, TYRVAYA™ (varenicline solution) Nasal Spray (TYRVAYA Nasal Spray), formerly referred to as OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray, a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. TYRVAYA Nasal Spray’s highly differentiated mechanism of action is designed to increase basal tear production with a goal to re-establish tear film homeostasis. 
Strategy
The Company is focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases. The company is committed to the mission of advancing breakthrough science to deliver therapies that help patients and eye care professionals (ECPs) needs. The Company intends to achieve this goal by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:
•Successfully commercialize TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, initially in the United States (U.S.) and to generate cash flows to support continued development of other pipeline candidates. The Company's exclusively owned commercial product, TYRVAYA Nasal Spray indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, was approved by the FDA on October 15, 2021. The Company has deployed a competitively sized sales organization of 150-200 field-based sales resources who are promoting to ophthalmologists and optometrists in the U.S. During the launch of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, a key focus has been on achieving commercial payor coverage for TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, providing patient support services and access programs to appropriate patients and ensuring pharmacy distribution. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating eye care professionals and patients about dry eye disease, the Company also anticipates continuing to deploy focused direct-to-eye care provider and direct-to-patient marketing campaigns for TYRVAYA Nasal Spray. The Company anticipates that this sales organization has the capacity to support the commercialization of additional product candidates treating ocular diseases that may be approved.
•Advance the development of OC-01 (varenicline) and OC-02 (simpinicline) in jurisdictions outside the U.S. to regulatory approval and commercialization, including the greater China region and other countries. With more than 300 million additional dry eye disease patients outside of the U.S., the Company believes there is a significant commercial opportunity for its products internationally. In August 2021, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (License Agreement) with Ji Xing Pharmaceuticals Limited (Ji Xing), which is affiliated with RTW Investments, LP, one of the Company's beneficial owners. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company granted Ji Xing an exclusive license to develop and commercialize OC-01 (varenicline solution) and OC-02 (simpinicline solution) nasal sprays, for all prophylactic uses for, and treatment of, ophthalmology diseases or disorders in the greater China region. The Company may continue to seek additional partners with international capabilities and infrastructure to support and potentially accelerate the clinical development and commercialization of OC-01 (varenicline) or OC-02 (simpinicline) or the Company's other product candidates, if approved, outside of the U.S.
•Developing OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray for additional indications associated with and beyond dry eye disease, and advancing the development of other product candidates to regulatory approval and commercialization. OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray is currently under investigation in the Phase 2 OLYMPIA study for the treatment of Neurotrophic Keratopathy (NK). Based on the fundamental role of natural tear film in ocular surface health, the Company plans to pursue development of OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray in other indications where re-establishment of tear film homeostasis is critical. In addition, the Company has other product candidates in varying stages of research and development.
•Selectively evaluating external opportunities to expand the scope of the Company's pipeline or product offerings. The Company may pursue collaboration, acquisition or in-licensing of product candidates, particularly in its core disease area of ophthalmic diseases.
TYRVAYA Nasal Spray Overview
TYRVAYA (varenicline solution) Nasal Spray 0.03 mg (formerly referred to as OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray) is a highly selective cholinergic agonist that was approved by the FDA in October 2021 to treat the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease as a multidose nasal spray. TYRVAYA Nasal Spray’s highly differentiated mechanism of action is designed to increase basal tear production with a goal to re-establish tear film homeostasis. The parasympathetic nervous system, the “rest and digest” system of the body, controls tear film homeostasis partially via the trigeminal nerve, which is accessible within the nose. The efficacy of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray in dry eye disease is believed to be the result of varenicline's activity at selective sub-type(s) of the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor where its binding produces agonist activity and activates the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway resulting in increased production of basal tear film as a treatment for dry eye disease. Varenicline binds with high affinity and selectivity at human α4β2, α4α6β2, α3β4, α3α5β4 and α7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time.
Dry Eye Disease Overview
Dry eye disease is a multifactorial, age-related chronic progressive disease of the ocular surface resulting in pain, visual impairment, tear film hyperosmolarity and instability, and inflammation. Patients with dry eye disease are also more susceptible to eye infections and damage to the surface of the eye (cornea). Dry eye disease is characterized by a reduction in tear volume, rapid breakup of the tear film, or an increase in the evaporative properties of the tear film layer. It can affect daily life, including reading and driving at night and has been associated with depression and migraines. Dry eye disease can also limit patients’ ability to tolerate contact lenses and can impact satisfaction with post-op cataract and refractive patients.
Chronic symptoms of dry eye disease include a scratchy sensation (foreign body sensation), stinging or burning, episodes of excess tearing that follow periods of dryness, discharge, pain, and redness in the eye. In addition, patients with dry eye often experience blurred vision as the cornea and the tear film are responsible for 65%-75% of the eye’s focusing power. Approved prescription treatments for dry eye disease, as well as therapies in clinical development, target inflammation further down the dry eye disease continuum. The Company believes these therapies have only been studied in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease and do not address the loss of tear film homeostasis, the fundamental characteristic of dry eye disease. TYRVAYA Nasal Spray is designed to stimulate the Lacrimal Function Unit (LFU) to produce natural tear film, re-establish tear film homeostasis and improve the signs and symptoms of patients with dry eye disease.
Market opportunity in dry eye disease
Dry eye disease is highly prevalent and growing, affecting more than 739 million people globally based on the Market-Scope study published in 2020. In the U.S., dry eye disease affects an estimated 14.6% of the adult population, or 38 million adults, resulting in greater than $55.4 billion in annual indirect costs, such as reductions in productivity. Prevalence of dry eye disease continues to grow due to an aging population, increase in autoimmune diseases, contact lens wear and digital screen time. Although dry eye disease is one of the most common reasons people visit ECPs in the U.S., it is estimated that only 17.3 million adults have been diagnosed with dry eye disease by an ECP, which the Company believes is due in part to lack of education and insufficient awareness on the part of the patient. Currently marketed prescription products often lack efficacy and also have a significant number of treatment burdens, including significant instillation site discomfort, delayed onset of efficacy up to twelve weeks, taste altering effects, resulting in relatively low persistence rates. The Company believes that the dry eye space remains a very large and underserved market and that the limitations of currently approved prescription treatments for dry eye disease reflect why only 2.0 million patients are on a prescription therapy at any given time. Despite the small percentage of dry eye disease patients on prescription therapy, most recent U.S sales for Restasis (marketed by Abbvie) were $1.23 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021, and Xiidra® (marketed by Novartis) had U.S. sales of $468 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the total number of prescriptions written for dry eye disease was 3.6 million.
Other treatment options and their limitations
Dry eye disease is commonly treated with a variety of over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and four FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis® (including a generic form of Restasis®, which was approved by FDA in February 2022), Xiidra®, Cequa™ (marketed by Sun Pharma) and Eysuvis™ (marketed by Kala Pharmaceuticals). Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis® and Cequa™, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, which have been approved and are indicated to increase tear production, address chronic inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Xiidra®, a lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist which has been approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, also addresses chronic inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Eysuvis™, a corticosteroid which has been approved for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, addresses acute inflammation. Other products used by patients suffering from dry eye disease include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. Unfortunately, these other approved treatment options for dry eye disease have significant limitations, which include:
•Mechanisms of action only address inflammation. Currently approved therapies only target inflammation for moderate to severe dry eye disease; no approved pharmaceutical products, other than TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, replicate basal tear film, which is highly complex in composition. 
•Slow onset of action. Based on data reported from clinical trials, currently available treatments, other than TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, can take between three to six months to demonstrate a significant effect in clinical signs. The Company believes this delayed onset of action may hinder compliance and in turn may limit the benefit that patients derive from such treatments.
•Tolerability and compliance issues. Currently approved pharmaceutical therapies for dry eye disease, other than TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, are typically administered in an eye-drop formulation and are commonly associated with ocular burning, reduced visual acuity and bad taste after application. The effective use of eye drops can be challenging for some patients and may result in reduced compliance. Corticosteroids are limited based on known complications of glaucoma and damage to the optic nerve as well as delayed wound healing of the cornea.
To address these limitations and the high unmet need expressed by patients, ECPs and third-party payors, the Company has developed and received FDA approval for TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, which the Company believes has the potential to become the new standard of care for dry eye disease. However, there is no guarantee of its success against other existing treatments. TYRVAYA Nasal Spray’s highly differentiated mechanism of action is designed to increase basal tear production with a goal to re-establish tear film homeostasis. The Company is not aware of any other drug company focused on activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway (TPP) and stimulating the LFU to increase tear production. Furthermore, the novel delivery of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray spares the ocular surface and is believed to contribute to a favorable ocular tolerability profile. The Company believes TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, has the potential to offer improved clinical outcomes and patient compliance based on its registrational trial results, favorable tolerability profile and rapid onset of action, therefore making it particularly suitable for use broadly across mild, moderate and severe patient populations.
Company's approach: activating cholinergic receptors on the trigeminal nerve to increase basal tear film production
The Company's therapeutic approach for dry eye disease is designed to leverage the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate basal tear film production to re-establish tear film homeostasis. A healthy tear film protects and lubricates the eyes, washes away foreign particles, contains antimicrobials to reduce the risk of infection, and creates a smooth surface that contributes refractive power for clear vision.
The Trigeminal Parasympathetic Pathway (TPP)
The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is a division of the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for actions such as stimulating gland function, constriction of the pupil, slowing down heart rate and contractility, contracting bronchial musculature and stimulating bronchial secretions, and increasing gut motility for digestion. The parasympathetic nervous system controls tear film homeostasis and the activity of the LFU partially via the trigeminal nerve. The PNS uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter.
Anesthetizing the nasal mucosa has been shown to result in a 34% reduction in tear film production. This has also been observed in patients with reduced nasal air flow resulting from severe nasal allergy and patients with tracheostomy, suggesting 
that stimulation of the trigeminal nerve is important for tear production. Since then, additional studies have demonstrated a persistent decrease in aqueous tear production in patients with trigeminal nerve damage (such as trauma, trigeminal nerve ablation and herpetic infection) or pathology.
The Company refers to the communication between the trigeminal nerve and the LFU as the TPP. The efferent paths (away from the nose) of the TPP proceed from the superior salivary nucleus along the facial nerve to the geniculate ganglion and from there through the greater superficial petrosal nerve via the sphenopalatine ganglion to the LFU. Activating the TPP results in the stimulation of the Meibomian glands, lacrimal glands (main and accessory), and goblet cells comprising the LFU and promotes natural tear film production.
Targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) on the trigeminal nerve
The Company's approach to dry eye disease relies on a pharmaceutical stimulation of a class of receptors called nAChRs that are located on the trigeminal nerve and readily accessible within the anterior nasal cavity. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels that when bound by an agonist have the potential for ganglionic neurotransmission. The nAChRs subtypes found on human neurons are comprised of various homomeric (all one subunit) or heteromeric (at least one α and one ß subunit) combinations of 12 different nicotinic receptor subunits: α2-α10 and ß2-ß4. Stimulation of these receptors results in a rapid increase in cellular permeability to Na + and Ca 2+ resulting in depolarization of the cell membrane and initiation of an action potential. However, not all subtypes of nAChRs have the ability to activate the TPP (for example, treatment with a homomeric α7 agonist has no effect on this pathway). Additionally, the functional response of an nAChR to agonists is comprised of two dose-dependent, opposing effects: receptor activation after short exposure to high agonist concentrations (µM range), and desensitization upon prolonged exposure to low agonist concentrations (nM range).
TYRVAYA Nasal Spray contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is highly selective to the nAChRs that activate the TPP. The Company believes this is the first application of nAChR agonists to be delivered nasally to stimulate the nerves of the PNS. Additionally, the Company has found that TYRVAYA Nasal Spray’s unique receptor binding characteristics and the localized nasal delivery allows for short-term agonist exposure with a high local concentration, and, once absorbed across the nasal mucosa, results in low systemic exposure.
Development Pipeline 
The following is the Company's development pipeline as of December 31, 2021:
OLYMPIA: Neurotrophic Keratopathy (NK) Clinical Trial Study
In June 2021, the Company enrolled its first subject in the OLYMPIA Phase 2 clinical trial of OC-01 (varenicline solution) nasal spray for the treatment of Stage 1 Neurotrophic Keratopathy (NK). NK is a degenerative disease resulting from a loss of corneal sensation, which causes progressive damage to the top layer of the cornea and can negatively impact visual acuity. As natural tear film contains a myriad of beneficial components, including endogenous growth factors, proteins and antibodies, the Company believes that its product candidate could be beneficial in improving the health of the cornea in these patients. A second population of potential clinical benefit is in subjects with dry eye disease associated with contact lens intolerance. In addition, based on the unique characteristics of this product candidate, the Company sees the potential for use in patients that are preparing the ocular surface for cataract and refractive surgeries where there is often an underlying dry eye condition that could impact refraction and ultimately patient satisfaction and quality of life post-surgery.
The Company, in concert with investigators, have initiated Investigator Initiated Trials (IITs) to research these populations.
NK is caused when the nerves that supply the cornea cannot function properly. NK reduces sensitivity of the cornea. When the cornea senses stimulation or pressure, the eyelids will close and tears will be produced to protect the cornea and the eye. Because these nerves do not function properly in NK, the outer layer of the cornea, called the epithelium, can break down, resulting in an epithelial defect. In more advanced NK, an interior layer called the cornea stroma can break down as well, resulting in thinning of the cornea. This is called stromal “melting.” In advanced stromal melting, the cornea can thin to a severe degree, which can result in a hole or opening to the inside of the eye, which can lead to infection and potentially loss of the eye. NK can lead to a variety of complications, including poor wound healing of the cornea, scarring of the cornea, and loss of vision. There are many different conditions that can damage the nerves serving the cornea, such as viral infections of herpes simplex and zoster, as well as late stage diabetes.
A variety of therapies can be used to treat this disorder depending on how far the disorder has progressed in an individual. Most recently, Oxervate™ (marketed by Dompe), a recombinant human nerve growth factor, has been approved for the treatment of NK. The product must be refrigerated, administered six times per day at two-hour intervals for eight weeks, and delivered with a pipette. The cost of the product is over $100,000 per course of treatment.
Normal tear film contains a number of biologically active growth factors including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor. The Company believes that stimulating natural tear film production twice daily for eight weeks may provide appropriate nourishment and lubrication that will be beneficial in treating Stage 1 NK. 
The OLYMPIA study design for Stage 1 NK, is included below. Enrollment in the OLYMPIA study is ongoing. The first patient enrolled in the study on June 17, 2021.
OLYMPIA Study Design
Enriched Tear Film (ETF) Gene Therapy
In July 2021 the Company announced preclinical data evaluating the first asset in its Enriched Tear Film (ETF) gene therapy platform, an adeno-associated viral vector that encodes the gene for the human nerve growth factor protein. In this proof-of-concept in vivo study evaluating OC-101 (AAV-NGF), a single, intralacrimal gland injection of an AAV containing the human NGF (hNGF) gene resulted in statistically significant levels of hNGF protein being expressed within the lacrimal gland and tear film of a rabbit model, as compared to control. Additionally, three weeks following OC-101 (AAV-NGF) transduction of the lacrimal gland, cholinergic activation of the lacrimal gland with OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray resulted in statistically significant increases in hNGF expression in the tear film, as compared to pre-cholinergic stimulation levels and as compared to control. Additional preclinical studies with this gene therapy approach are currently underway.
Collaboration Agreement with Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT) 
In May 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT) to leverage APT’s PhageBank™ technology for the development of potential treatments for multiple ophthalmic diseases.
SARS-CoV-2
Additionally in July 2021, the Company announced preclinical data in non-human primates and in vitro models evaluating OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray and OC-02 (simpinicline) nasal spray against SARS-CoV-2, the viruses that cause COVID-19 disease, and the alpha and beta variants. Administration of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, a highly selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, was observed to provide protection to rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 nasal infection. Additional pre-clinical studies are ongoing to better elucidate the mechanism of action and confirm activity against the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. 
Regulatory
On October 15, 2021, the FDA approved TYRVAYA Nasal Spray 0.03 mg for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. The Company faces potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that the Company successfully develops and commercializes will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The Company believes that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of its product candidates will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
A number of therapies are currently available for the treatment of dry eye disease in the U.S. The most commonly used treatments for dry eye disease in the U.S. are over-the-counter eye drops, often referred to as “artificial tears,” and four FDA-approved prescription eye drop therapies: Restasis®, Xiidra®, Cequa™ and Eysuvis™. Artificial tears are intended to supplement insufficient tear production or improve tear film instability but are primarily saline-based and provide only temporary relief. Restasis® and Cequa™, both calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants, and Xiidra, a LFA-1 antagonist, address chronic inflammation associated with dry eye disease. Eysuvis™ provides temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, which may include the management of dry eye disease flares. In addition, in February 2022, the FDA approved a generic version of Restasis®. Other treatment options include ointments, gels, warm compresses, omega-3 fatty acid supplements and a number of medical devices. The Company is aware of many other companies developing therapies for dry eye disease, including Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Alcon, Aldeyra Therapeutics, Abbvie, Azura Ophthalmics, Bausch Health (Novaliq), Glaukos, HanAll BioPharma, Johnson & Johnson, Mitotech, Novartis, Parion Sciences, ReGenTree, Silk Technologies, Sylentis, TopiVert Pharma, and TearSolutions.
Many of the companies against which the Company may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with the Company in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the Company's programs.
Sales and Marketing
The Company has established a sales organization consisting of 150-200 field-based sales representatives. This sales force is targeting approximately 21,000 ECPs, which include both optometrists and ophthalmologists, which generate approximately 94% of dry eye therapy prescriptions.
The Company's market access team is working on establishing formulary coverage for the majority of lives covered by commercial plans and Medicare Part D plans. Product affordability for the patient drives consumer acceptance, and this is generally managed through coverage by third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (third-party payors) and such products are subject to rebates and discounts payable directly to those third-party payors. 
The Company also expects to explore commercialization of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the U.S., including greater China, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other 
marketing arrangements with one or more third parties. In this regard, in August 2021, the Company entered into the License Agreement with Ji Xing. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company granted Ji Xing an exclusive license to develop and commercialize OC-01 (varenicline solution) and OC-02 (simpinicline solution) nasal sprays, for all prophylactic uses for, and treatment of, ophthalmology diseases or disorders in the greater China region.
Major Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant percentage of the Company's sales of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray were to large wholesale drug distributors. Sales to Western Wellness Solutions LLC, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen accounted for 42.1%, 21.2%, 18.3% and 17.0% of total gross sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Manufacturing and Supply
The Company does not currently own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray or of its product candidates. It relies and expects to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), to manufacture and supply TYRVAYA Nasal Spray and its preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of its product candidates.
In July 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with a CMO to manufacture and supply TYRVAYA Nasal Spray for an initial term of three years. Under this agreement, the Company is to pay a minimum capacity reservation fee of $2.5 million per year during the initial term and any year thereafter where the capacity reservation is renewed. The minimum capacity reservation fee is subject to potential future credit allowances based upon the prior year's manufacturing production, as provided for in the agreement.
The raw material components of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray consist of nasal pumps, bottles and varenicline, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The Company believes that the amounts of cGMP varenicline API, nasal pumps, bottles, and manufacturing capacity are available in adequate quantities to meet the Company's TYRVAYA Nasal Spray commercial demand and the Company’s future and on-going clinical studies. 
Although the Company currently relies on a separate, single API manufacturer as its sole supplier for the OC-01 API to manufacture TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, it is also in the process of identifying and qualifying additional CMOs to provide OC-01 API and drug product manufacturing to support the submission of a post approval change to the NDA for TYRVAYA Nasal Spray for commercial supply or to support future clinical studies. The Company expects that it can qualify an OC-01 API manufacturer and qualify and transfer the process to a selected CMO. Additionally, the drug product manufacturing is a simple compounding and aseptic controlled filling operation that could also be transferred to additional CMOs as necessary.
The Company's third-party service providers, third-party supply chain providers, their facilities and TYRVAYA Nasal Spray used in clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The cGMP regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Product candidates used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities’ requirements before any product is approved and before the Company can manufacture commercial products. The Company's third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of their facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray to assess compliance with applicable regulations. The Company's failure, or the failure of its third-party providers and supply chain providers, to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements could subject the Company to possible legal or regulatory action, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could have a material impact on clinical or future commercial supplies of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray or the Company's other product candidates. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.

Ji Xing is prohibited from engaging in certain competitive activities during the term of the License Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, the Company may not commercialize any nAChR agonist in the Field in the Territory, without first offering Ji Xing a right of first negotiation for such product in the Territory. The Company has also granted Ji Xing a right of first negotiation to expand indications or uses of OC-01 (varenicline) or OC-02 (simpinicline) in the Territory. For further discussion of the License Agreement, see Item 15, Note 12 — License and Collaboration Agreements.
Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, Inc.
In May 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with APT for the development of potential biological treatments for multiple ophthalmic diseases. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, the Company has the option and certain rights to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize APT’s technology for ophthalmic diseases and disorders. Under the license terms, if such option is exercised, the Company would pay for potential development and regulatory milestones, as well as the potential for sales-related milestones and tiered royalties of net sales, if a licensed phage therapy is approved by the FDA or certain other regulatory authorities. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company paid a one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of $0.5 million for the collaboration and option agreement which was included in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Pfizer Inc.
The Company is party to a non-exclusive patent license agreement with Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which granted the Company non-exclusive rights under Pfizer’s patent rights covering varenicline tartrate to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray product. Pursuant to the license agreement, the Company is required to pay a one-time sales-based milestone payment of $10 million if annual U.S. net sales of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray exceed $250 million prior to December 31, 2026. The Company is also required to pay royalties based on annual U.S. tiered net sales of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray at percentages ranging from 7.5% to 15% until the expiration of the royalty term. The royalty obligation to Pfizer commences upon the first commercial sale of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray and expires upon the later of (a) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity granted to Pfizer in connection with varenicline in the U.S.; and (b) the expiration or abandonment of the last valid claims of the licensed patents. The Company recorded an immaterial amount of royalty expense due to Pfizer which was included in accrued expenses on the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. No milestone was achieved, or royalties accrued as of December 31, 2020. 
Intellectual Property
Patents
The Company's success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for its product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing its proprietary rights. The Company's patent portfolio is intended to cover its product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, the Company's proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to its business. It also relies on trade secret protection of confidential information and know-how relating to the Company's proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.
The Company's patent portfolio as of December 31, 2021 included approximately 17 issued and unexpired U.S. (U.S.) patents, six pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, and one pending patent cooperation treaty (PCT) application, as well as certain foreign counterparts of certain of these patents and patent applications in countries including, among others, 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and countries within the European Patent Convention and the Eurasian Patent Organization, all of which are solely owned by the Company. Owing to the substantial cost of prosecuting patent application internationally, the Company has selectively and strategically abandoned certain of its patent applications in countries with smaller markets and/or a history of weak patent enforcement record. The Company’s European patent related to OC-01 (varenicline) has been opposed. There is a risk that the European patent will be invalidated, or will have its claims amended, through the opposition process. With respect to its candidate OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray, the Company's patents and patent applications include methods of treatment and pharmaceutical formulations. With respect to the Company's candidate OC-02, the patents and patent applications cover chemical composition, synthesis and preparation, formulations, and methods of treatment. The Company continues to seek to maximize the scope of its patent protection for all its programs. As of January 31, 2022, the Company had six issued U.S. patents relating to methods of treating dry eye disease, increasing tear production, increasing lacrimal proteins, and improving ocular discomfort using varenicline, as well as pharmaceutical formulations for local nasal administration of varenicline. These patents expire in 2035.
Licenses
The Company is party to a non-exclusive patent license agreement with Pfizer. Pursuant to the license agreement, Pfizer granted the Company non-exclusive rights under Pfizer’s patent rights covering varenicline tartrate and related salts thereof, including U.S. Patent Nos.: 7,265,119 and 6,890,927 to develop, manufacture, and commercialize varenicline product candidate for the treatment of any ophthalmic disease or condition via nasal administration in the U.S. Under the license agreement, the Company was obligated to make upfront payment to Pfizer, as well as potentially additional milestone payments and royalties upon achievement of certain milestones. For further discussion, refer to Item 15 — Note 12, License and Collaboration Agreements. 
Regulatory Matters
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. 
The Company's product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA/BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) or a Biologics License Application (BLA);
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCP;
•potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to 
validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the U.S.
Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol.
NDA/BLA Review
Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or a BLA (if the product is a biologic medicine), along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or a BLA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA and BLA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs and BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six to eight months, depending on 
whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing changes. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the Company interprets the same data.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy conducted by or on behalf of the applicant. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations, new routes of administration, or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and/or effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s prior findings of safety or effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA concerning each patent listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). Depending on the type of certification, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product, such as the 5 years of exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit brought by the holder of the listed patent, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the product is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing monitoring and record-keeping adverse event and other periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and product promotion and advertising including restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on 
the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. The Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of its products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
•suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Other Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
For example, in the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; 
•the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates,” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects pharmaceutical companies, among others, to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for 
recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of the Company's U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, the Company may apply for restoration of patent term for its currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
European Union Drug Development
Previously, in the European Union, pursuant to the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Directive), a clinical trial application had to be submitted to each country’s national regulatory authority in which the clinical trial was to take place, together with an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Although the Directive had sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, EU Member States transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently, leading to significant variation in the regulatory regimes of the member states. In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) and entered into application on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Pursuant to the Regulation, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EMA's Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), which will cover all regulatory and ethics assessments from the member states concerned.
Any submissions made from January 31, 2023 onwards must be made through CTIS and all trials authorized pursuant to the Directive that are still ongoing on January 31, 2025 must be made through CTIS. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a member state's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the European Union is, as it was under the Directive, the responsibility of individual member states, but compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation there is expected to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states. The new Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements, such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to a new EU Database.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations:
•The European Union MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. The vast majority of new and innovative medicines pass through the Centralized Procedure
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in the European Union for up to five years. Unlike patent term-restoration, SPCs apply to extend the protection afforded by the relevant patent solely in relation to the product covered by the marketing authorization and are intended to offset the loss of patent protection afforded to such product due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
Other International Markets-Drug approval process
In some international markets (e.g., China or Japan), although data generated in U.S. or EU trials may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, additional clinical trials conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, may be required prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of the Company's products will depend, in part, on the extent to which its products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of the Company's products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As of December 31, 2021, the Company is in discussions with certain regional and national health insurance and managed care plans for coverage of TYRVAYA Nasal Spray, including formulary placement, reimbursement level, and specific coverage requirements, which the Company anticipates will continue into the first half of 2022.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. The Company may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of its products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require the Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which the Company receives marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for the Company's products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices it might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies. This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process, which is currently governed by the national laws of EU Member States, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of an HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. Moreover, EU Member States may choose to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, including efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. During his term in office, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and the Company's business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the 2% Medicare sequesters have been suspended from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for the Company's drugs, if approved, and accordingly, the Company's financial operations. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on  July 24, 2020, and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2023, in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed to January 1, 2023. In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would have tied Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule to rescind the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future, or the impact they will ultimately have on drug pricing. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Company expects that additional healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
