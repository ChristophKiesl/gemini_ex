ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
We were an IT-solutions provider that provided a multi-dimensional e-commerce platform to facilitate shopping, business, trade and integrates online & office transactions in a single application. Prior to June 2019, we developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users’ cash and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June 2019, we ceased the operation of the platform but continue to maintain our IT solution business operations. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2020, and 2019, we generated comprehensive losses of $1,064,620 and $1,493,284, respectively.
 
Since we ceased operations of our platform June 2019, we unsuccessfully attempted to diversify into the energy, oil & gas sector to strengthen our financial position. Our current principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any binding agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We hope to continue to engage in discussions with other operating businesses affiliated with our executive officers regarding potential acquisition opportunities. There is no assurance that any nonbinding term sheet will result into a definitive purchase transaction nor can we assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire such company or any company in the near future.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

• | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
• | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
• | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
• | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
• | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
• | Other relevant factors. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities, which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
 
HISTORY
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007. Prior to our acquisition of MIG Mobile Tech Berhad (“MMT”), a corporation organized under the laws of Malaysia, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We were also a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We operated under the name “Contact Minerals Corp. and our securities traded under the symbol “CNTM.” Effective November 6, 2017, we changed our name to “WECONNECT Tech International, Inc.” and our symbol to “WECT.” Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the “MMT Shares”), constituting approximately 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we ventured into the IT solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia. On June 2019, MMT ceased the operation of the platform and currently only maintains its IT solution business operations.
 
Effective August 29, 2017, the Company and Kerry McCullagh, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer (the “Seller”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Shiong Han Wee and Kwueh Lin Wong (collectively, the “Purchasers”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers agreed to purchase 7,000,000 shares from the Seller (the Seller Shares”) and 78,770,000 shares from the Company (the “Issued Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $350,000. The sale of the Seller Shares and the Issued Shares consummated September 11, 2017.
 
Upon the consummation of the sale, Kerry McCullagh, Alex Langer and William McCullagh, our former executive officers and directors, resigned from all of their positions with the Company. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
The following individuals were appointed to serve in the positions set forth next to their names below:
 

Name | Age | Position 
---------------+-----+------------------------------------------------
Shiong Han Wee | 44 | Director, Chief Executive Officer 
Kwueh Lin Wong | 44 | Director, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary

 
Chee Kuen Chim and Pui Hold Ho were each appointed to serve as a Director of the Company effective September 22, 2017. Mr. Chim resigned from his positions with the Company effective May 11, 2018, and Mun Wai Wong was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by such resignation on June 1, 2018.
 
Effective June 1, 2018, Kwueh Lin Wong resigned from his position as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Chow Wing Loke was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Wong’s resignation.

Effective July 16, 2020, Mr Chow Wing Loke resigned from his positions as our chief financial officer. Mr Shiong Han Wee was appointed as the interim chief financial officer effective July 16, 2020 to fill the vacancy created by such resignation.
 
Effective June 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of 49,831,007 shares of MMT (the “MMT Shares”), constituting approximately 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MMT. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the MMT shareholders 498,310,070 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.05 per share, for an aggregate value of US$24,915,503.50. As a result of our acquisition of the MMT Shares, we entered into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia.
 
MMT was established in 2015 and commenced operations in Malaysia on October 2015. MMT had developed and operated a mobile platform designed to consolidate users’ cash and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. On June 2019, MMT ceased the operation of the platform. Our current principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
