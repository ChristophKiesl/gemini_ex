Item 1. BUSINESS
​
Overview
​
TopBuild Corp., headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a leading installer and distributor of insulation and other building products to the United States construction industry. Prior to June 30, 2015, we operated as a subsidiary of Masco, which trades on the NYSE under the symbol “MAS.” We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2015 as Masco SpinCo Corp. and we changed our name to TopBuild Corp. on March 20, 2015. On June 30, 2015, the Separation was completed and on July 1, 2015, we began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “BLD.” 
​
Segment Overview
​
We operate in two segments: our Installation segment, TruTeam, which accounts for 72% of our sales, and our Distribution segment, Service Partners, which accounts for 28% of our sales. 
​
We believe that having both TruTeam and Service Partners provides us with a number of distinct competitive advantages.  First, the combined buying power of our two business segments, along with our national scale, strengthens our ties to the major manufacturers of insulation and other building products.  This helps to ensure we are buying competitively and ensures the availability of supply to our local branches and distribution centers.  The overall effect is driving efficiencies through our supply chain.  Second, being a leader in both installation and distribution allows us to reach a broader set of builders more effectively, regardless of their size or geographic location in the U.S., and leverage housing growth wherever it occurs.  Third, during industry downturns, many insulation contractors who buy directly from manufacturers during industry peaks return to purchasing through distributors.  As a result, this helps to reduce our exposure to cyclical swings in our business. 
​
