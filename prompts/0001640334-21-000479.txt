Item 1. Business.
General Overview

As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms the “Company,” “A4L,” “we”, “us” and “our” mean Assisted 4 Living, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Assisted 2 Live, Inc., a Florida corporation (“A2L”), unless otherwise indicated.

We were incorporated in Nevada on May 24, 2017, with an objective to operate as a facilitator of assisted living projects and related services. We have positioned ourselves as a go-to resource for individuals or private groups that wish to enter and operate within the Assisted Living Facility (“ALF”) industry. Our current market is Florida, and we operate within the State through our wholly-owned subsidiary A2L, which was incorporated on June 15, 2017. Our goal is to use Florida as a test market to streamline our consulting processes and ultimately transition to a national company in the ALF field. The barriers to entering the ALF space are considerable and require a detailed understanding of each State’s regulatory environment and processes. There are a myriad of steps that must be navigated to properly set up an ALF operation; including, but not limited to, licensing, complying with building codes, medical care requirements, staffing and industry regulations. Our business model is to mentor prospective ALF clients and guide them through every step of the start-up process, working hand-in-hand with them to ensure that their facility gets off to a proper and sustainable start.

Our Current Business

Our key philosophy is to facilitate the growth of residences that offer a stimulating environment, and provide care that empowers seniors (and young people in specific circumstances) to live an independent and fulfilling life, while also providing the residents assistance with their housekeeping, transportation, medical, personal hygiene, dressing and cooking needs.

Through the experience of the principal officers of A2L, we provide a resource for anyone wishing to do business in the ALF field. We guide clients through every stage of the organizational and licensing process required towards establishing an ALF. We can also assist in the operation of a new ALF in conjunction with the owners to ensure that the facilities are established and functioning smoothly, from physical site planning to optimizing care levels and strategies for the various populations in need.

We charge a fee for these services, whereby a prospective ALF operator can choose the specific area of expertise in which they require developmental assistance and pay according to incremental needs. Clients can simply opt for consultation in licensing, or physical space configuration, staffing requirements and certifications, resident referrals, or other details of the ALF environment. We offer a full range of services and options, from isolated consultations to an option whereby we will set-up and walk clients through every step of the ALF process, and oversee the project for six months to ensure a smooth emergence into the marketplace.

In addition to acting as a facilitator of ALF projects and related services, we manage the day-to-day operations of a 32-bed assisted living project in Punta Gorda, Florida through A2L. 

Our principal executive office is located at 6801 Energy Court, Suite 201 Sarasota, Florida 34240 and our telephone number is (888) 609-1169. Our corporate website is www.assisted4living.com.

We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

Principal Products, Services and Their Markets

We are a facilitator of ALF projects and related services. We are a resource for private individuals or groups that wish to enter and operate within the ALF industry. Our current market is Florida, and we operate within the State through our wholly-owned subsidiary, A2L. Our strategy is to use Florida as a test market to better define our consulting processes, and ultimately become a national presence in the ALF field. The barriers to entering the ALF space are considerable and require a detailed understanding of each State’s regulatory environment and processes. There is a myriad of steps to properly set up an ALF residence, including, but not limited to licensing, building codes, medical care requirements, staffing and industry regulations. We are designed to mentor prospective ALF clients and assist them through every step of the start-up process, working with them to ensure that their facility gets off to a proper and sustainable start.

The ALF industry is rapidly growing, and the skewed demographics of the current aging population will only further propel interest in this industry. The number of potential ALF residents is expected to grow as our aging population reaches the point where they begin to experience declines in their various physical, intellectual, social and mental abilities, and overall health. ALF residences offer people with mild health problems a uniquely supportive environment in which to live, being tailored to provide a ‘home-like’ atmosphere where residents enjoy all their familiar comforts, with the advantage of being in a stimulating social community and not an ‘institutionalized’ feel. Additionally, however, they may also receive supplemental medical supervision and minor medical care, alongside the essentials for daily-living help.

When we took over the day-to-day operations of the 32-bed facility in Punta Gorda, we expanded on our original consulting mandate and adapted to include the management of a physical operation. We can now bring prospective and actual clients into an operating facility to demonstrate and instruct on the various aspects of operating an ALF. 

Distribution Methods

Potential clients discover our services through two primary channels: the first is through referrals generated from an informal network of industry contacts, and the second is through our www.Assisted4Living.com website. The website is optimized for keywords that are related to the ALF industry. In Florida, the www.Assited2Live.com website will be created and locally optimized to help generate regional business. We also create on-line Google and Facebook ads that target keywords such as ‘Assisted Living,’ and ‘Assisted Living Facilities’. In addition to this, we take out print ads in publications such as AARP magazine.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Assisted4Living’s Position in the Industry

We compete with other ALF companies that are currently in the Florida market. Large nationally-recognized companies such as Life Care Center of America and Brookdale Senior living are competitors, as well as smaller regional operators such as South Port Square and Genesis Healthcare. It is possible that new or prospective ALF operators will gravitate to these larger entities for guidance. However, based on the professional history of A2L’s officers in the Florida market, we are experienced, connected, and able to compete. We will also compete with these larger firms for prospective ALF residents. While there are established and strong competitors in the Florida ALF market, however, the industry is growing, and we are positioning ourselves to be a niche player as a resource-intensive consulting company providing a highly personalized approach to the ALF marketplace.

While we are able to take on the regulatory and logistical challenges of opening a large ALF center (60 beds+), we are focusing our efforts on smaller, more family-oriented projects (with as few as 4 residents). Keeping an ALF from 4-16 residents can maintain the personal home-style context. We’ve structured our consulting approach to target this area and view it as an unrealized niche growth opportunity. The barriers to developing a small-scale ALF project are also significantly less than those for constructing and conforming to the regulatory steps of larger, more industrial-sized projects.

By taking over the physical operations of a 32-bed facility in Punta Gorda, we gained both credibility and greater access to the Florida Gulf Coast ALF market. We intend to leverage this access to market our consulting services to other prospective clients and/or industry professionals. 

Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers

Our success will depend on the quality of our leadership and their ability to leverage industry knowledge and contacts. A2L is headed by Romulus Barr, an 18 year veteran of the assisted living industry. Mr. Barr has owned and operated an ALF center in Portland, OR, and currently owns a 16-bed facility in Punta Gorda, Florida. The one facility that Romulus currently owns is not operated by him, but rather has been leased to a third-party operator. Mr. Barr has a broad understanding of the dynamics on the ALF field, consults on ongoing projects, and developed a standardized ‘Emergency Plan’ that was adopted for use by the State of Florida. Having operated in Florida for the past ten years, Mr. Barr has developed close relationships with local SW Florida case workers, guardians, and AHCA Florida State regulators. In short, Mr. Barr has a network of industry contacts and a deep understanding of the ALF industry. Mr. Barr hopes to expand this success beyond Florida to other states. Mr. Barr is also directing the operations of the recently added 32-bed facility in Punta Gorda, Florida. 

Anca Barr has also worked closely with the Agency for Health Administration (AHCA- Licensing), the Department of Children and Families (case work and resident placements), and the Department of Health (food storage, preparation, and service). Ms. Barr has also worked on a day-to-day basis with ALF centers, and has extensive experience on how to establish centers, care for the residents, manage staffing and budgets, as well as coordinate with medical professionals and regulatory agencies.

Together, both Romulus and Anca provide us with substantial experience within the industry.

Research and Development

Since inception, no funds have been expended on research and development.

Employees

We have one employee, our Chief Executive Officer, who we hired on February 1, 2021. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, A2L, has 12 full-time employees whose primary duties consist of preparing food and caring for the residents of our ALF.

Dependence on one or a few major customers

We are not dependent on any one customer for our success. We have multiple customers and clients and continue to solicit partners to ensure a balanced mix of potential leads.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts

There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent or trademark. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements

We are subject to state and local regulation as it pertains to ALFs owned and/or operated by us. In Florida, our ownership and operation of the ALF facility in Punta Gorda is subject to the approvals and licensing of the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). AHCA regulates all aspects of owning and operating an ALF. This agency is responsible for approving new ALF licenses, regulating existing licenses, enforcing codes, as well as ensuring the proper implementation of Emergency Plans. The Florida Department of Agriculture, Division of Food Safety also regulates our ALF facility, since we provide food service, and must comply with safe food standards.

Our business model will also be impacted by these, and other governmental agencies that regulate ALFs and operations, as they will also regulate our clients and their operations.

If our clients end up dealing with clients on Medicaid, state case workers will also be engaged and have an impact on our business. Other states have their own regulatory agencies who oversee ALFs, and who will need to be engaged when and if we decide to expand beyond the Florida market.
