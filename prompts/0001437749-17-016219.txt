Cardiology - Acute Myocardial Infarction – Cesca has a proprietary, point-of-care autologous stem cell-based therapy under development which is intended as an adjunct treatment for patients who have suffered an acute ST-elevated myocardial infarction (“STEMI”), the most serious type of heart attack.  Such treatments are aimed at minimizing the adverse remodeling of the heart post-STEMI. 
 
Orthopedics – OsteoArthritis (OA) - Cesca is in early stage development of an autologous stem cell based therapy intended to treat patients with cartilage tissue degeneration that may lead to progressive cartilage loss and painful joint diseases. Localized articular cartilage defects can potentially be repaired by transplantation of autologous cell therapy. Therapies in development using Cesca’s proprietary PXP™ system are expected to delay further deterioration and repair the damaged joint cartilage. Treatment is typically via a single procedure in the hospital or clinic. 
 
Our Strategy
 
Our business strategy involves:
 

● | Sustaining our leadership position in automated devices for the separation and concentration of stem cell preparation from cord blood and bone marrow.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leveraging our expertise in clinical biobanking and cell-based therapeutics to introduce new automated manufacturing solutions to developers of CAR-T and other immuno-therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Becoming the partner-of-choice for immune-oncology developers looking to achieve increased output while adhering to Cellular Manufacture Control (CMC) best practices
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivering a fully integrated offering: We intend to deliver all the hardware, software and disposable components necessary for the aspiration and processing of autologous bone marrow to prepare a therapeutic dose of stem cells for re-injection into the patient at the point-of-care.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Partnering our clinical development with market leaders in selected medical areas to maximize internal values of our existing pipelines. Our protocols are based on the use of autologous (donor and recipient are the same individual), bone marrow derived stem cells which are potentially safer than alternative allogeneic approaches.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Following a simpler regulatory path: Cesca’s protocols are autologous and the stem cell preparations are minimally manipulated, allowing an investigational device exemption pre-market approval approach. This reduces costs and time to market when compared to investigational new drug or new drug application approaches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding patent protection: In the US, we have 17 patents issued and a series of applications pending. In addition, we have a series of corresponding international patents issued and pending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regenerative Medicine 
 Regenerative cell therapy relies on the delivery of specific types of stem cells that have been shown to enable the repair, restoration or regeneration of diseased or damaged tissue.  A broad range of cell types has been investigated, including cells found in peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood and bone marrow.
 
The regenerative medicine field continues to contribute to meaningful advances in the practice of medicine, as evidenced by numerous FDA and European Union (“EU”) therapeutic product approvals and the commercialization of a growing number of cell-based therapies. Most of the progress has been achieved through the broader application of adult stem cells, reflecting a greater awareness and appreciation of their therapeutic potential. 
 
The market for regenerative medicine is supported by companies that develop devices or methods for harvesting, processing, purifying, expanding, modifying, cryopreserving, storing or administering cells, or by companies that develop and commercialize the therapeutic agents themselves. Key success factors for such companies include: 
 

● | The ability to achieve high recovery and concentration of target cell types
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Device ease-of use, efficiency and speed
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Cell product purity, viability and potency
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Cost effectiveness
--+-------------------


● | Regulatory approval / FDA clearance
--+------------------------------------

 
The delivery of a cell therapy typically involves a process whereby target cells are harvested from a donor or patient, processed or expanded (grown) either within a hospital laboratory or by an FDA regulated, therapeutic manufacturer, formulated into an effective, safe dose, and delivered to a patient through a specific delivery device. Cell preparations may also be formulated in a point of care setting such as an operating room. Requirements for the preparation and use of cell therapies at the point of care include system portability, sterile field packaging, minimal manipulation, swift cell processing and predictable target cell recovery rates. 
 
Our growth strategy includes the development of autologous cell therapies for treatments intended to be carried out at the point of care. We believe that commercial opportunities for such therapies will emerge in cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology/wound healing and selective areas of oncology, followed by more complex pathologies such as those found in diabetes and central nervous system disorders. 
 
We also believe that developments in the field of regenerative medicine will be critical in helping to address the global increase in health care costs. As emerging cell therapies are proven to be safe, effective, and a cost-effective alternative to current standards of care, we believe adoption will accelerate. A fundamental requirement, however, will be the continued development of baseline clinical and cost-effectiveness data through comprehensive clinical studies.
 
Bio-Banking
 Cord blood, the blood that remains in the umbilical cord after a baby is born, is rich in stem cells. Since the first cord blood transplant was carried out in 1988, stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood have become widely accepted for medical use and have been used regularly in medical procedures worldwide for the treatment of a wide range of blood diseases, genetic and metabolic disorders, immune-deficiencies and cancers. Cord blood use in clinical applications is now widely accepted and cord blood banks exist in nearly every developed country as well as a growing number of developing nations.

Cesca’s ThermoGenesis division is an established leader in the development and manufacture of automated systems that enable the separation, processing and cryopreservation of stem cell preparations from cord blood. In recent years, however, the overall number of cord blood samples being collected has decreased. 
 
Our Products
 
We design, manufacture and sell advanced devices created specifically for the separation, concentration and cryopreservation of cell types used in the practice of regenerative medicine. Such automated devices are essential to the successful development of cell therapies because they ensure a high degree of quality control over both the preparation and storage of stem cell concentrate. Our current and future product offerings include:

● | The AutoXpress™ System (AXP™) – a proprietary automated device and companion sterile disposable for concentrating hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Point-of-CareXpress™ System (PXP™) – a proprietary automated device and companion sterile disposable for the isolation and concentration of hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow.

Cell Manufacturing and Banking Services

Through our TotipotentRX subsidiary in Gurgaon, India, we operate an advanced clinical cell manufacturing, processing, testing, and storage facility, compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), Good Tissue Practices (“GTP”), and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”). We can support the production of a small, personalized medicine cell prescription. Patient samples and therapeutic aliquots are all labeled in accordance with ISBT 128 and stored in our own cryogenics facility. In addition, our clinical research organization (CRO), also located in Gurgaon, is, to our knowledge, the only specialized, in-hospital, cell therapy CRO in the world. We have unique expertise in the design and management of cell based clinical trials, including the ability to support the device prototyping and validation typically required for a combination product. These services ensure patient safety under Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), quality laboratory documentation under GLP, and quality cell processing and handling under both GMP and GTP.  In partnership with Fortis Healthcare and through our advanced clinical infrastructure we also operate commercial service programs supporting bone marrow transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) for hematological and oncological disorders as well as a licensed umbilical cord blood and tissue bank (“NovaCord”).
Our Clinical Programs
 
Our therapeutic development initiatives, focused in the fields of cardiovascular diseases and orthopedic cartilage regeneration, are based on our proprietary PXP™ platform for the point-of-care harvesting, processing, and delivery of cells from the patient’s own peripheral blood or bone marrow. A key advantage of our point-of-care system is that it is capable of delivering high cell viability and potency through a short intra-operative procedure, including bone marrow collection, target cell selection, characterization of the final cell concentrate, and re-injection into the patient. Based on our point-of-care platform, our critical limb ischemia clinical program has received FDA clearance to initiate a phase III clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy in “no-option” or “poor-option” CLI patients. In additional to vascular diseases, we are also conducting early phase studies in orthopedic and wound healing areas. We are actively looking for strategic partners to co-develop our clinical programs.

Sales and Distribution Channels

We market and sell our products through independent distributors, except in North America and India, where we sell direct to end-user customers. 
 
Competition
 
The regenerative medicine market is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition from medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies and stem cell companies operating in the fields of cardiovascular, orthopedic and neural medicine. The primary competitors for our current device offerings include BioSafe and MacoPharma (for automated cell processing systems), and BioE, Terumo Harvest, Zimmer BioMet and Pall Corporation (for manual cell processing systems). Our competitors in the field of cell therapeutics development include MesoBlast, Osiris Therapeutics, Baxter International, Athersys, Caladrius, Capricor, Celyad, Juventas Therapeutics, Vericel, Cytori Therapeutics, Pluristem Therapeutics, Zimmer BioMet, and Bioheart.   
Research and Development
 
Our research and development activities in fiscal 2017 were geared towards expanding the automated platform for point-of-care applications and immune-oncology applications. Each of these development initiatives leveraged our existing AXP™ and PXP™ platforms, with a focus on both performance improvements and ease of use in intraoperative applications. Emphasis was also placed on enhancing the capabilities of our contract manufacturing partners and building on our product quality leadership position. 
 
Collectively, research and development expenses were $2,497,000 and $3,230,000 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Research and development activities include expenses associated with the engineering, regulatory, scientific and clinical affairs functions.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for high volume, disposable products and in-house manufacturing for low volume, high complexity devices. In addition, we are exploring the potential for the development of in-house capabilities relating specifically to pilot scale disposable manufacturing in support of our clinical programs. 
Quality System
 
Our quality system is compliant with domestic and international standards and is appropriate for the specific devices we manufacture. Our corporate quality policies govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use. Such policies are intended to ensure that the products we market are safe, effective, and otherwise in compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) (21 C.F.R. Part 820) and the applicable rules of other governmental agencies.

We and our contract manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, codified in the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”). Compliance requirements relate to manufacturing processes, product testing, documentation control and other quality assurance procedures. Our facilities have undergone International Organization of Standards (“ISO”) 13485:2012 and EU Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) (93/42/EEC) inspections and we have obtained approval to CE-Mark our products. 
 
Regulatory Scheme and Strategy
 
The development, manufacture and marketing of our cell therapy products, as well as the design and implementation of our clinical trials, are subject to regulation by the FDA as well as the equivalent agencies of other countries including the countries of the European Union and India.
 
The trials we conduct in India are compliant with the applicable rules of the Indian Council for Medical Research, Ministry of Health Order No. V.25011/375/2010-HR and requisite institutional ethics committee (IEC) and institutional committee for stem cell research and therapy (IC-SCRT) approvals. Both the U.S. and E.U. regulatory agencies are experienced in dealing with and accepting Indian clinical trial data. GCP necessitates review and approval by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) before initiation of a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IRB, and the documented receipt of a freely given informed consent prior to participation in the study from each subject participant.
 
We have a quality and regulatory compliance management system that meets the requirements of the ISO 13485: 2003 standard, the FDA’s QSRs, the EU MDD, Canadian Medical Device Regulations (“SOR 98-282”), and all other applicable local, state, national and international regulations.
 
●       Medical Devices. The FDA regulates medical devices to ensure their safety and efficacy under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act. Medical devices are defined by language within the FD&C Act which essentially states that a product is considered a medical device if it is intended to provide a diagnosis or basis for treatment. Once a company determines that its product is a medical device, it is required to comply with a number of federal regulations. These include the following: 
 
● | 510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA, prior to commercialization (unless the device is classified as “exempt”)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Registration of the company and listing of the medical device with the FDA (within 30 days prior to commercialization)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishment and adherence to the FDA’s labeling requirements, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishment and adherence to the FDA’s Quality Systems and Medical Device Reporting regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA classifies medical devices into three groups: Class I, II or III. These are stratified from lowest to highest safety risk, and regulatory controls increase based on Class. 
 
Class I Devices
 Some of our products are considered to pose little or no risk when used as directed and have been deemed by the FDA to be “exempt” from FDA approval or clearance processes prior to commercialization. While pre-marketing FDA review is not mandatory for Exempt Class I medical devices, the manufacturer’s compliance with QSR is nevertheless a requirement.
Class II Devices
 Several of our products, including the BioArchive and the AXP are categorized as US Class II medical devices and require premarket notification, also known as a section 510(k) clearance, prior to commercialization. Data submitted as part of a 510(k) process must demonstrate a device is “substantially equivalent” with a predicate device that is already on the market. Once 510(k) clearance has been secured, the new medical device may be marketed for its intended use and distributed in the U.S.
 
 
10



Class III Devices
 If a product is considered a Class III device, as is the case with the Point-of-care CLI System, the FDA approval process is more stringent and time-consuming, and includes the following:

● | Extensive pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Submission and approval of an IDE application prior to the conduct of a clinical study
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Human clinical studies (or trials) to establish the safety and efficacy of the medical device for the intended use, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission and approval of a PMA application to the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-clinical testing typically involves in vitro laboratory analysis and in vivo animal studies to obtain information related to such things as product safety, feasibility, biological activity and reproducibility. The results of pre-clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IDE application and are reviewed by the Agency before human clinical trials can begin. We use external third parties, as well as our own facility in Gurgaon, India (GLP Compliant) to conduct pre-clinical studies.
 
Higher risk clinical trials conducted inside the U.S. are subject to FDA IDE regulation (21 C.F.R. Part 812), or an IND application (21 C.F.R. Part 312). Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., and the data collected therefrom are allowed in accordance with applicable FDA requirements. The FDA or the Sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time if either believes that study participants may be exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
For certain Class III devices, data generated during product development, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as a PMA application in order to secure approval for commercialization in the U.S. The FDA may deny the approval of a PMA application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and in some cases may mandate additional clinical testing. Product approvals, once obtained, can be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market. The FDA might also require post-marketing testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and efficacy of a medical device and has the power to forbid or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Information
 Medical device manufacturers must register with the FDA and submit their manufacturing facilities to biennial inspections to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can result in withdrawal of marketing clearances, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or loss of distribution rights. In addition, device manufacturing facilities in the state of California must be registered with the California State Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health and submit to an annual inspection by the State of California to ensure compliance with applicable state regulations. We are also subject to a variety of environmental laws as well as workplace safety, hazardous material, and controlled substances regulations.
 
If we are successful in securing Medicare reimbursement, we will be subject to federal and state laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal anti-kickback laws, state anti-kickback laws, and the federal “Stark” laws, that govern financial and other arrangements among healthcare providers, their owners, vendors and referral sources, and that are intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements that are designed to induce the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical products or services payable by any federal healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. They also prohibit some physician self-referrals. These laws are liberally interpreted and aggressively enforced by multiple state and federal agencies and law enforcement (including individual “qui tam” plaintiffs) and such enforcement is increasing. For example, the Affordable Care Act increased funding for federal enforcement actions and many states have established their own Medicare/Medicaid Fraud Units and require providers to conspicuously post the applicable Unit’s hotline number. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. 
 
 
11



Also, federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests.
 
Changes in these laws at all levels of government are frequent and could increase our cost of doing business. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, refund payments to the government, lose our licensure or accreditation, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
International Regulatory Requirements
 International regulatory requirements differ somewhat from those of the U.S. In the EU, a single regulatory approval process has been created and approval is represented by CE-Marking. To be able to affix the CE-Mark to our medical devices and distribute them in the EU, we must meet minimum standards for safety and quality (known as the essential requirements) and comply with one or more conformity rules. A notified body assesses our quality management system and compliance with the Medical Device Directive. Marketing authorization can be revoked by the applicable governmental agency or notified body in the event of an unsuccessful quality system annual audit.
 
In India, the regulatory body having oversight of medical devices, therapies, and cell banking is the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (“CDSCO”), and specifically the Drugs Controller General India office. Our marketing and facilities licenses are subject to revocation by the applicable state Drug Controller in Haryana or DCGI. 
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
We believe that patent protection is important for our products and current and proposed business. We currently have over thirty issued patents globally. The patent positions can be uncertain because they involve interpretation of complex factual information and an evolving legal environment. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced either before or after the patent is issued. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will actually result in an issued patent. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any existing or future patent will provide significant protection or commercial advantage, or that any existing or future patent will not be circumvented by a more basic patent. Generally, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. In addition, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or the first to file a patent application for the subject matter covered by each of our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications.
 
 
12



If a third party files a patent application relating to an invention claimed in our patent application, we may be required to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding conducted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine who owns the patent. Such proceeding could involve substantial uncertainties and cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that our patents, if issued, would be upheld as valid in court.
 
Licenses
 
The following are certain material agreements involving our business.
